This                is Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot. We had the good fortune                a while back to interview Ann Eller, who worked for six months                with J. Allen Hynek, and was good friends with him until his                death in 1986.</em></font></p>                <p><em><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We                      haven&rsquo;t released the interview for quite some time                  due to a problem with synchronizing the sound to the picture,                      because of what seemed to be an electromagnetic pulse that                      was sent to the camera during the interview. We are now                      releasing just the audio, because we feel that the content                      is so fascinating that - I think you&rsquo;ll agree - it&rsquo;s                      worth salvaging.</font></em></p>                <p><em><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because                      of her time with Hynek, she has a completely different                      take on what he might have thought about UFOs as well as                      what might have occurred during the consultation he did                      with Steven Spielberg on Close Encounters of the Third                      Kind. He may have been the one to suggest the scene that                      you see at the end of the movie, in which you see Richard                      Dreyfuss and a group of scientists boarding an alien craft.<br>                      <br>                This                is reminiscent of the Serpo Project.

As much as Serpo may be a lot of disinfo, there                      is a grain of truth having to do with the Secret Space                      Program, which is being investigated at this time by Richard                  C. Hoagland. </font></em></p>                <p><em><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think                    you&rsquo;ll enjoy this interview and we&rsquo;re                  really pleased to be able to present Ann Eller to you at this                  time.

So I told everyone that                Dr. Hynek sent his best to all of them, and also went on                to talk a little bit about the research. And I happened to                say: <em>We                    don&rsquo;t                  think you&rsquo;re crazy.

She made that statement                      during our interview as an outtake, and I just couldn&rsquo;t                  resist putting it up front here.</em></font>..</p>                <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><font color="#990033">Start                          of interview</font></strong></em></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>                          <br>                          K: Could you tell a little bit about how we got                    in contact with each other? Because you actually found us,                    which is a little unusual.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes.                    I don&rsquo;t know how I got to Project Camelot on                  the internet, but, you know, one link lead to another, lead                  to another, and I found your link and started reading about                  your project. And I thought, <em>Well this is extremely worthy</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have                    felt most of my adult life that it was important to get this                    information out to the general public and to blow the whistle                    on the government and everything that they&rsquo;ve                  kept under wraps for all these years. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so I signed up, giving my support to you, and in, I think                  that initial contact, I said, <em>Oh, and by the way, I worked                  with Dr. Hynek for six months as his personal assistant when                  he moved out to Arizona.</em> And then you got in touch with                  me. This was in 1985.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: I think                    I started around March of 1985 and my tenure there ended                    in October. I went back to the hospital in October. I was                    a nurse at the time and left nursing for six months to do                    this with Dr. Hynek, because I thought it was an opportunity                  that I couldn&rsquo;t pass up. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.                    You told us that, actually before this ever happened, you&rsquo;d                  been having some dreams.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes.                    That&rsquo;s how I first contacted Dr. Hynek. Along                  about&hellip; Well, my whole history started in 1960 when I                  read the article in the <em>Readers&rsquo; Digest</em> about                  Betty and Barney Hill. And at the end of that article, the                  author said: <em>Well, fact or fiction? We&rsquo;ll leave it                  up to the reader to decide</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And my reaction was one of being incensed. I thought, <em>Of                    course it&rsquo;s real</em>. How I knew it was real, I have                    no idea, but I knew it was real. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I was                    interested in aliens, UFOs, since 1960. But it was in, probably                    1976, I started having dreams, constant dreams, night after                    night after night, for about 4 years, of aliens, spacecraft,                    UFOs, other planets, other worlds, government involvement,                  helicopters, hidden bases&hellip; was all part of my dreams.                  And it was just about ready to drive me crazy, like I told                  you, a little bit like the guy in <em>Close Encounters of the                  Third Kind</em> with the mashed potatoes. [Kerry laughs]. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I started                    reading everything there was to read about UFOs. But in every                    book I picked up was Dr. Hynek&rsquo;s name. And                  I decided, <em>Well this is the guy that knows, that has all                  the answers, so I&rsquo;m going to write to him and ask him                  just what&rsquo;s up, and could he at least point me in a direction,                  introduce me to somebody in Arizona that I could talk to about                  these dreams.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I wrote                    to him and didn&rsquo;t hear a word from him for                  about nine months. And then all of a sudden one night the phone                  rang and I picked it up. <br>                And he said<em>, I&rsquo;d love to speak with Ann Eller</em>. <br>                And I said, <em>Speaking.</em> <br>                And he said, <em>This is Dr. Hynek.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well you could have knocked me over with a feather at that                  point. [Kerry laughs]. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But he said, <em>I&rsquo;m                      interested. </em>He said,<em> I                    just found your letter. It had dropped behind my desk and                    I just found it.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that was very typical, to lose the letter and find it                  nine months later. He had a quality of being sort of an absent-minded                  professor. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so he said, <em>I&rsquo;m                      very interested in your dreams.</em> And                  so we chatted about those for a while. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he                    wanted to know if I&rsquo;d kept a log of them. And                  I said, <em>Well, sort of. I could probably pull it together.</em> And                  he said he had a colleague -- and it was either Switzerland                  or Sweden; I think it was Switzerland -- that was doing a research                  project on these dreams, because they were worldwide. It was                  a worldwide phenomenon. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I typed up all the dreams and got them off to him, with                  the help of a dear friend, and I never heard anything more                  from him. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it                    was probably six years later, I opened up the Phoenix paper                    and here the headline&rsquo;s on the second page: <em>Dr.                  J. Allen Hynek Brings UFO Research to Arizona.</em> I couldn&rsquo;t                  believe it! And it was practically in my back yard. It was                  just down the street, up Indian School. So                I                  decided I had to be involved.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was working                    at the hospital, nights. But one morning when I got off from                    work, I drove over there and met Tina and Bryan, who were                    the couple that brought&hellip; were instrumental                  in bringing Hynek to Arizona, along with a couple of other                  people. And they were living in this condo. And they were going                  to have the research project there in their condo. And they                  needed somebody to set up an office. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I said, <em>Well,                      I&rsquo;ve gotta be involved.</em> Whether                  I feed the cat or take the trash out, I didn&rsquo;t care.                  I had to be involved. So I came&hellip; I would work nights,                  come mornings, and set up the office and set up the filing                  system and take calls. People were calling already. I mean,                  they hadn&rsquo;t hardly gotten settled but people were calling,                  reporting sightings. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Now,                    this was during the time when Hynek was already, was through&hellip; theoretically, through&hellip; working                    with the Air Force and no longer working on Bluebook and                  all that, right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: That was all behind him.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: That                    was all behind him. That project ended in 1969. So at that                    time, then, he left, and went to Northwestern University                    where he was a professor of astronomy and set up CUFOS in                    Chicago. That was his UFO research project in Chicago. So                  for those years, that&rsquo;s what he was doing as a civilian. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And these people were able to convince him that he needed                  to come to the southwest. And I suppose the weather in Chicago,                  somehow, had a little to do with it, too. [Kerry laughs]. So                  they moved out. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it was probably 2 weeks after I had started at the center                  before I met him. And then I met him and I told him who I was,                  that I was the person that had sent him the dreams. Of course,                  I imagine that there were a thousand people that had done that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But about a week later he asked me if I would come be his                  assistant and set up his office. All his office supplies and                  furniture were coming soon. And he said, <em>I can&rsquo;t                  pay you much</em>. He said, <em>I&rsquo;ll pay you $100 a week                  and we&rsquo;ll try to get funding. And if we can get the funding                  in, then maybe we can make it a permanent thing. </em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I did it. I quit nursing and I went to work for him. And                  it was a great relationship. We had a very warm and very respectful                  friendship. I liked him a lot personally. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I spent                    some time being very angry with him, but this was mostly                    after he died, that he had, during his years at Project Bluebook,                    had hindered or injured so many people and their lives by                    explaining away their experiences and telling them that,                    no, they didn&rsquo;t see what they saw. It was Venus                  chasing the moon. It was the swamp gas. It was an airplane.                  It was a weather balloon. Whatever. But he was hired to be                  the debunker and he was doing his job and he did a good job.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Mm hm.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: But I was very angry about that. Because at the end of                  his life, the last thing he said to me was<em>: I have had                  my own experiences.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now during the six months, I would periodically ask him: <em>Have                    they contacted you yet? Have you seen a ship yet?</em> [Kerry                    laughs] You know, just kidding around. And we&rsquo;d just                    joke about it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But he was very serious at this point. And when he looked                  at me, he had that knowing look in his eyes: <em>I&rsquo;ve                  had my own experiences.</em> And he took it to his grave. You                  know? Nobody else knew that, that I know of. Maybe Mimi knew                  it, his wife. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So, to back up a little bit, he sent you out to cover a                  conference in Laramie, Wyoming, is that right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes.                    It was a UFO conference of contactees and investigators.                    And it was held at the University of Wyoming, and Leo Sprinkle                  was the host. He was professor of psychology at the university.                  He was also a hypnotist. He would put people under hypnosis                  and take them back and see if they&rsquo;d had any contacts,                  if they&rsquo;d had any abductions. There had been a little                  bit of criticism about the way in which he did this and they                  weren&rsquo;t sure whether it was &ldquo;totally professional.&rdquo; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said, <em>Why                      don&rsquo;t you just go up there and meet                    Leo? Check it out. Meet some of the other people. </em>He                    said, <em>I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy it</em>. Because I enjoyed                    the personal side of the whole UFO scenario, and the metaphysical                    and the spiritual aspect of it too. So I went.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What you said before was, that Hynek was very into the                  nuts and bolts?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Oh,                    yes. Very definitely. Very concerned about his credentials.                  Didn&rsquo;t want those being marred in any way, so was very                  tight-lipped -- <em>very</em> tight-lipped -- played everything                  very close to his chest. And if we had an opinion, he&rsquo;d                  keep it to himself pretty much, unless it had to do with the                  nuts and bolts. He wanted tangible proof. He had to either                  see the ship, take a picture of a ship, touch the ship, have                  some kind of radiation from the ship&hellip; those kinds of                  nuts and bolts.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh. And when you were working for him, did you ever                  see pictures or photographs of UFOs cross your desk?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes. A lot of them. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: A lot of them. OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Old ones, you know, from years and years back, where the                  film was bad, very grainy. Oh yes, lots of UFO pictures.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And                    did you ever&hellip; because you would file documents                  for him, is this right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes.<br>                .<br>                K: So did you ever come across, I don&rsquo;t know, information                  about Roswell or, you know, that kind of thing?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Well,                    we came across a lot of documents that were declassified,                  had been at one point Top Secret. But about 7/8 of the document                  would be blacked out, inked out, and you&rsquo;d get maybe                  a half a sentence here and a half a sentence there. So it really                  didn&rsquo;t mean a heck of a lot. I did see a list of the                  names that were in Majestic 12.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do you recall those names?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Well, one of them was Rockefeller. That was a name I recognized.                  I might recognize some names. It seems to me there some admirals.                  And maybe Brzezinski was one of the names. But we <em>knew</em> that                  President Eisenhower had had a meeting with the aliens at one                  of the Air Force bases. I think it was Holloman. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: When                    you say you &ldquo;knew&rdquo;&hellip; meaning you                  and Hynek? Or Hynek made you aware of this? Or, how did that                  work? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: I&rsquo;m                    very reluctant to say that Hynek ever said anything like                    that. It was more Tina and Bryan and me, and all the people                  that came through the center, all the information that we picked                  up from people that came through the center. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were                    aware that Eisenhower had met with the aliens, and I believe                  it was at Holloman Air Force Base, and that was back in the &lsquo;50s. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you&rsquo;ve                    read <em>Alternative 3</em>, that&rsquo;s                  enough to put a crack in your cosmic egg [Kerry laughs] about                  the government, you know, being a benevolent government.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So was <em>Alternative 3</em> something that Hynek would                  have also been aware of?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Oh,                    I think very definitely. Because in 1960 -- and he was very                    much involved with the Air Force then -- in l960, that&rsquo;s                    when <em>Alternative 3</em> took place. All those                  scientists got together, of which he was a scientist. Now,                  whether he was actually involved in any of their deliberations,                  I&rsquo;m not sure.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Now what about Jacques Vallee? Because you said, is this                  right, he was one of the people that visited Hynek?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes, he did. They were very good friends. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do you                    think that he was, you know, I don&rsquo;t know,                  maybe sort of &hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: I don&rsquo;t know about Jacques. Jacques was very prominent                  in the UFO field. He did a lot of writing; very personable,                  very important in France. Of course he was French but living                  in the United States. And they did go to a high level UFO conference                  in Paris that summer of &lsquo;85, he and Hynek. And it was                  the United States, the French, the Japanese, and the Russians                  that met that summer. I was never told anything dramatic that                  came out of that meeting. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the                    French were way ahead of us. They had already put out a booklet                    to the civilian population, what to do if you come across                  a UFO parked, you know, in the field. So&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Now you told us an anecdote about Jacques Vallee. Can you                  repeat that for the camera? In other words, something about                  that he was upset with Hynek over the swamp gas situation?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes. The story went -- and this came during a conversation                  with Dr. Hynek, and I was sitting there -- was that they were                  reminiscing about the swamp gas episode. And that Jacques was                  upset with Hynek because he had gone on camera and had said, <em>This                  is swamp gas</em>. And he said, <em>Why didn&rsquo;t you call                  me? Why didn&rsquo;t you? I would have come and we could have,                  you know, we could have done this thing together.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: In other words, he could have thought of something differently?                  Was that the implication?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: That was the implication, that it would have been done                  a lot better than it had been.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: The                swamp gas was a poor excuse for &hellip; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: So that was one incident. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And then, some of the other people that came to visit Hynek                  while you worked for him. Can you remember anything in relation                  to these people?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Dr.                    Willard Smith came and he was a very dear friend of Dr. Hynek&rsquo;s.                    They were old and close friends and they looked like cosmic                    twins. They were about the same height, stature, looked just                    alike. He was from Florida. He was an astrophysicist. And                  they just, they were just good fellows, you know? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Smith,                    I understand, got some of Dr. Hynek&rsquo;s files                  when Dr. Hynek died. They were very close. And he did visit                  him that summer and Dr. Hynek went to Florida to visit him                  also. They would work together in cahoots all the time.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.                    So, both of them were involved in investigating&hellip; I&rsquo;m                  assuming &ldquo;the work,&rdquo; when you say &ldquo;work,&rdquo; it                  was investigating UFO reports?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What                    about crashes? Did you ever see information about crashed                  disks? Did he ever&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: We saw...                    There was a film that we got into the center that we looked                    at that was supposedly a crashed UFO in Canada. I remember                    the lights flashing, the red and white lights on top of this                    craft. And that&rsquo;s all I remember about that,                  about a crash. So there was one in Canada that we saw. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But you                    have to &hellip; People don&rsquo;t stop to ask themselves                  this question. Dr. Hynek was the civilian chief astronomer                  for the United States Air Force for 20 years, from 1948 to                  1969. He had top level clearance, secret clearance. So for                  20 years -- and this was all in the area of unidentified flying                  objects -- for 20 years he was on the front line of what was                  happening. He has to have seen the alien bodies, the crashed                  craft. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think                    even more than that, the other operations that were going                    on that we&rsquo;ve heard about, like Serpo and also&hellip; Because                  if you remember, in <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>,                  of which Dr. Hynek was a technical advisor, there was a group                  of chosen military people who went into the craft that were                  being exchanged to go to the planet. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So in                    other words&hellip; Often we have wondered where                  Spielberg might have gotten his information to include that                  in the screenplay. And what you&rsquo;re basically saying here                  is that it&rsquo;s possible that he got it from Hynek.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: It&rsquo;s possible. Or it could have been&hellip; More                  the scenario would be, Spielberg would imagine to Hynek that, <em>What                  if we had some kind of an exchange program going on with the                  aliens, and we put that into the movie? Would that be OK?</em> And                  then Hynek might say, <em>Well, yeah. You could explore that                  or maybe put that in</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think                    that&rsquo;s a little more realistic. Dr. Hynek was                  going to be very careful about what he said to anybody because&hellip; Well,                  the dragon was breathing down his neck, too, during all that                  time.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: When                    you say &ldquo;the dragon was breathing down his neck,&rdquo; was                  there any evidence that he was visited by people or that any                  pressure was brought to bear? Did he ever receive phone calls                  or, you know, were you aware of any kind of surveillance upon                  him?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: No,                    I wasn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t tell you that I was.                  We knew that all of our phones were bugged. We knew that to                  be a fact. And right after I first started working there, I                  developed migraine headaches, which I&rsquo;d never had before,                  and they lasted for 10 years. Now, whether that had anything                  to do with any psychotronics or anything, I have no idea. But                  as far as I know, there were no Men in Black. There were no                  rough-&lsquo;em-up guys that I was aware of ever coming.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But he never crossed any lines, from the sound of things.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: No.                He didn&rsquo;t.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: He basically                    bought into the entire party line, so he wasn&rsquo;t                  a threat in any way, so it&rsquo;s unlikely he would be pressured,                  at least overtly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What about his death? Did you think that his death was                  a completely natural occurrence?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: There                    was a lot of speculation in the center that it was not. But                    how do you know? And how do you prove that? Certainly a man                    of his age &ndash; and I want to tell you about Haley&rsquo;s                  Comet, so don&rsquo;t let me forget. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: But                    certainly a man of his age, 76, it&rsquo;s a very natural                  thing for him to develop prostate cancer. But it didn&rsquo;t                  get better. And he sought specialists in St. Louis at Barnes                  Hospital, and also in San Francisco. And it just metastasized                  and then he eventually died in March of &lsquo;86. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what                    I want to tell you is, Hynek was convinced that he would                    die at the age of 76 in 1986. He was born in 1910, the year                    of Haley&rsquo;s Comet and he knew that when Haley&rsquo;s                  Comet came back around again, 76 years later, that he&rsquo;d                  be ushered out.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Really? Did he tell you this?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Yes, he did. He told me that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: That&rsquo;s                fascinating.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: I thought                    that was interesting, too. And in fact that&rsquo;s                  exactly what happened.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So, just to wrap up, what else can you tell us? Are there                  any other pieces of information that you think might be useful                  to the public in relation to Hynek?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: Well, I would like to mention the log that he had. One                  day I discovered, on the bookshelf as I was tidying up, this                  log that he had written in every day and it was in code. And                  I thought to myself, <em>Why in the world would he be keeping                  a daily log in code?</em> And the code looked something like                  Morse Code, like dot-dot-dash kinds of things. There were no                  words written. There were just the dates and then this type                  of code. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And of                    course, you know, we&rsquo;re always suspicious of                  everything in this UFO field. And I thought, <em>Is it possible                  that he could be working both sides of the street?</em> But                  until that time, I would not have ever guessed it. He played                  it very straight the whole time I was there. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was one other incident. It was a letter that I found                  that was unopened, and it was postmarked 1954. And you know,                  Hynek was professor of astronomy at the Ohio State University                  for a while. And this came from an Asian or oriental. It was                  an oriental name. It was either like Wong or Ling or something                  like that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it                    said, basically, that this person -- he could have been a                    student, he could have been a colleague at the university                  -- had discovered these signals in their radio telescope. They                  had identified these signals coming from the area of Venus                  and that they were &ldquo;intended,&rdquo; or they were transmissions,                  or they were&hellip; there was an intelligence behind these                  transmissions. It wasn&rsquo;t just something that was happening                  in the weather.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And so this letter had remained unopened until you saw                  it and decided to open it. Is that right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: That&rsquo;s                    right. I was the secretary and I thought, <em>Good                    grief, there&rsquo;s a letter from&hellip;</em> And it wasn&rsquo;t                    hard for me to imagine he just forgot to open it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A: So I opened it and I was shocked. And then I realized that                  this was probably sent to Hynek for Hynek to hold in case,                  at such time somebody else discovered these transmissions and                  declared life on Venus and got the credit for it, that this                  guy had done it first. So I showed it to Dr. Hynek and he just                  made light of it and took it and I never saw it again.</font></p>                <hr>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>K: I hope you enjoyed this interview.
