We&rsquo;re                  here on Thursday, February 12, 2009, and we&rsquo;ve got Peter                  Levenda. He is a wonderful researcher and author. He&rsquo;s                  very well known for his book, <em>Sinister Forces</em>, which                  apparently is a three-book series. Also for his previous book                  called <em>Unholy                  Alliance</em>, delving into the background of the Nazis. <font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="peter_levenda_6.jpg" width="343" height="513" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right"></font></p>                <p class="style7">Peter, I just want to say hello. Thank you so much for taking                  the time with us today. I have to say I am incredibly impressed                  by your writing style as well as your honesty as a researcher                  in the way that you write. You actually remind me a little                  bit of Richard Dolan, and I think you know who he is because                  you cite him a couple of times in your work.</p>                <p class="style7">Peter Levenda (PL): Certainly. And thank you, thank you very                  much for the introduction. I&rsquo;m very happy to be part                  of this.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Great. So what we wanted to do is give the listener                  basically a background on where you come from, how you come                  at this material, because I think that&rsquo;s really important                  -- the fact that it dovetails with a lot of what Richard Hoagland,                  Jim Marrs, Joseph Farrell, and others are delving into, but                  may even have pre-dated some of their work and their realizations                  in this area. </p>                <p class="style7">And we&rsquo;re talking about how the Nazis, how mind control,                  and how... the direction America&rsquo;s going and why we might                  be going in a certain direction, and what the underpinning                  occult significance is of all that. And I think your background                  is just really stellar in this regard. So please just go from                  here and tell us where you come from and where you&rsquo;ve                  been going with all of this.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll try. I tried, back in the 1970s,                  during the Watergate era, to write a book that was going to                  explore the relationship between religion and politics, which                  is a nexus that&rsquo;s always fascinated me. We tend in the                  United States to think of them as two separate entities. </p>                <p class="style7">But during Watergate I began to see a lot of the same personalities                  crop up that we had run across during, oh, the Kennedy assassinations                  and all of that, and I started to see deeper and deeper parallels. </p>                <p class="style7">So there was a book that came out in 1960, long before Watergate,                  called&nbsp; <em>The Morning of the Magicians.</em> It was                  written by two Frenchman, Pauwels and Bergier, and it talked                  a great deal in there about a Nazi / occult connection, but                  it was not documented at all. And I thought: <em>That would                  make a great chapter</em> [Kerry laughs] <em>in the book that                  I was planning. Let me write something about the Nazis and                  religion, or Nazis and occultism or mysticism.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And I went down to the National Archives in Washington, DC.                  This was right at the height of Watergate. Nixon was still                  in power. He was about to leave. It was a month or two before                  he left, so the whole thing was at fever pitch in Washington. </p>                <p class="style7">But, oblivious to that in a sense, I was at the National Archives                  looking at captured German documents. As I was in the National                  Archives, the archivist there, a very famous archivist -- anyone                  who studied the Nazis back in the &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s                  would have known about Dr. Wolfe -- when he found out what                  I was trying to do, he suggested that I look at the records                  of an organization called the SS Ahnenerbe, which was actually                  a division of the SS that was specifically concerned with occult                  and mystical research. I was stunned. </p>                <p class="style7">He led me to the microfilm rolls. I started going through                  the machines. And here I realized -- my jaw dropped -- I was                  looking at the actual documentation of a full-fledged Nazi                  program to investigate occultism. </p>                <p class="style7">Other authors had talked about a Nazi / occult connection.                  The book, <em>The</em> <em>Morning of the Magicians,</em> talked                  about it at length, but there was no documentation at all.                  And some of the other books that had come out at that time,                  for instance, <em>The Spear of Destiny</em>, and some of the                  others, talked extensively about this but there was no documentation. </p>                <p class="style7">So it seemed like speculation until suddenly I&rsquo;m staring                  at all the documents -- page after page after page of research                  in Tibet, Tibet expeditions. There was research to find the                  Holy Grail. There was all sorts of bizarre SS programs that                  were being financed heavily by the Nazis during World War Two. </p>                <p class="style7">So it got me thinking that maybe there <em>is</em> a lot of                  documentation in the world. Maybe you <em>can</em> find evidence                  of all of this without having to speculate too much. So the                  Nazi documentation got me very excited. </p>                <p class="style7">I lived in New York City at the time. I&rsquo;m from New York                  City. I was talking to a lot of friends of mine who had their                  roots in Latin America and South America. I read a book by                  Ladislas Farago called <em>Aftermath</em>, which is about the                  survival of war criminals, Nazi war criminals, in South America. </p>                <p class="style7">And I came across the mentioning of a weird establishment                  in Chile called <em>Colonia Dignidad</em> the Colony of Righteousness.                  This was supposed to be a kind of Nazi safe-house which was                  also a weird religious group, high up in the Andes Mountains.                  And I thought: <em>This is just too good to pass up.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So here not only do I have the documentation from World War                  Two, but now I have a real live Nazi sanctuary in South America                  which is also a religious operation, which is exactly what                  I was writing about. </p>                <p class="style7">So I decided to go to Chile -- this was in 1979 -- and see                  this place for myself. This was during the time of the Pinochet                  dictatorship. There was martial law in the country, but I managed                  to make my way down to a small town halfway down the coast                  of Chile called Parral. And close to this small town is the                  colony, Colonia Dignidad. </p>                <p class="style7">I managed to go up there. The story is told at length in my                  book, <em>Unholy Alliance.</em> But I managed to go there on                  a Sunday morning in June of &rsquo;79, and I as briefly detained.                  I was kept there. I was forbidden to leave. My passport was                  taken. The film was taken out of my camera. </p>                <p class="style7">I was told by the Germans -- These were Germans. These were                  not Chilenos. These were not Spanish people -- I was told by                  the Germans that I was not welcome in the country, that I had                  to leave Chile immediately. </p>                <p class="style7">And as I was allowed to leave, which was touch-and-go for                  a while, all the way back to Santiago, to the capital where                  I had my hotel room, I was stopped along the way. I was in                  a bus and I was stopped along the way by troops who had set                  up roadblocks, who were making sure that I was on that bus.                  When I got back to my hotel room, there was a note waiting                  for me that said I was on the next plane, that a reservation                  had been made.</p>                <p class="style7">So the amount of influence that the Nazi network had in 1979... &rsquo;79                  was so many years after the end of World War Two, you know.                  We&rsquo;re talking 25 years later. They still had such great                  influence in a country so far away as Chile that I began to                  see there was a lot more going on than even I suspected. And                  that eventually became <em>Unholy Alliance.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">I began to see the connections between governments in Bolivia,                  Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, an extensive Nazi network, a lot                  of money that had left the Third Reich when the Nazis had lost                  the war. </p>                <p class="style7">I began to realize that the Nazi Party was not a political                  party the way we understand political parties, but that the                  Nazi Party was a cult. If you look at it from that point of                  view, you can understand the true nature of this kind of evil,                  because the Nazi Party is... they&rsquo;re not going to go                  away simply because they lost the war. </p>                <p class="style7">The old war criminals who escaped -- and some of them are                  still alive. A few of them have died recently in South America,                  in Chile and Argentina. They have their followers. They have                  their philosophy, their ideology.</p>                <p class="style7">Bill Ryan (BR):&nbsp; Forgive me for interrupting you, Peter.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; But it sounds implicit in what you&rsquo;re saying,                  then, that they have support from deep within the governments                  of those South American countries.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, sure. I mean, it depends on                  which regime is in power at any given time. But let&rsquo;s                  take the example of Bolivia. Klaus Barbie, who was the &ldquo;Butcher                  of Lyon&rdquo; in                  France, who was a man responsible for all sorts of war crimes                  in France, at one point became the chief of the secret police                  of Bolivia. I mean, he had a federally-appointed position in                  that government. </p>                <p class="style7">Walter Rauff lived for a very long time in Chile. Walter Rauff                  was the man who designed the mobile gas chambers, the vans                  that were used to re-channel the exhaust into the vans to kill                  prisoners. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, all of these people found safe haven, not only in                  South America, but in the Middle East and in Asia as well,                  and to a certain extent in Australia. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And in the United States as well.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Absolutely. Certainly. Of course we&rsquo;ve had                  many cases here in the United States of war criminals that                  we&rsquo;ve found, uncovered, and occasionally shipped back. </p>                <p class="style7">A famous one, which got me very involved in the story, was                  the man who for a long time was the head of the Romanian Orthodox                  Church in the United States. Here was an Archbishop who during                  World War Two had been a member of the... what was the name...                  the Iron Cross? The Iron Arrow, I think, a Romanian Nazi organization,                  who had tortured prisoners. </p>                <p class="style7">Here was a man who was a devoted Nazi, who after the war was                  over fled to the United States, and although he had no seminarial                  training as far as I&rsquo;ve been able to uncover, he managed                  to take over one branch of the Romanian Orthodox Church in                  our country, in the Midwest, and was not even discovered until                  maybe 20 years ago, when he was forced to leave the country. </p>                <p class="style7">So yeah, we&rsquo;ve helped a lot of people escape. The Catholic                  Church, also, to a certain extent was involved in that, in                  an operation called <em>Caritas</em> during World War Two,                  which provided Vatican passports to help some of the more famous                  war criminals escape to South America. So there was a lot of                  collaboration. </p>                <p class="style7">And even in our own country, in the United States, we had <em>Operation                    Paperclip</em>, in which we brought Nazi scientists over                    to help with our space program, among other things. </p>                <p class="style7">So that got me working on what eventually became <em>Sinister                    Forces.</em> I began to wonder how was it that we in the                    United States could have sold our souls so easily to something                    as heinous as a criminal organization like the SS, and to                    the Nazis in general, to bring their scientists over here,                    to make them work for us, and really to give them great jobs,                    to give them positions in our industry. </p>                <p class="style7">Walter Dornberger is an example, who held a job on the board                  of directors of Bell Helicopter. All sorts of people. People                  who worked for the Space Medicine Program in Texas, at Randolph                  Air Force Base. There&rsquo;s a very big story there.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. And that has tentacles that go to the whole                  mind control aspect. I think that you cover that really wonderfully                  in <em>Sinister Forces</em>. I mean, I can&rsquo;t imagine                  what you do in <em>Book Two</em> and <em>Book Three</em>, but                  I have to say that that&rsquo;s really a huge story.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, I develop the same ideas. In <em>Book Two</em> I                  focus a lot on the Charles Manson family, as a kind of quintessential                  example of what sinister forces might be from the behavior                  modification / mind control aspect. </p>                <p class="style7">And then in <em>Book Three</em> I sort of lay out what I think                  is the whole story and how this works. I connect serial killers                  to mind control operations and try to understand. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, our country, the CIA in particular in the 1950s, 1960s,                  all the way up through until about Watergate, until the 1970s                  and the Rockefeller investigations, was involved in one of                  the most bizarre experiments of modern times. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, here we were, trying to figure out how the human consciousness                  worked, how to understand memory, volition. How do we erase                  a person&rsquo;s memory, implant new memories? How do we make                  a person do something they would not ordinarily do -- for instance,                  commit an assassination? And then forget about it and not know                  why they did it? </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, this was something like a medieval king, you might                  think, hiring alchemists and magicians, you know, to contact                  the other world. We were doing that in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s                  and probably still are today. </p>                <p class="style7">We have operations in which we are trying to understand how                  the mind works and then to control it. Like a sorcerer&rsquo;s                  apprentice, our intelligence agencies stuck their fingers into                  human consciousness and started playing around with the contents.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp;&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the answer to your own question,                  Peter, which you posed just a couple of minutes ago? About                  how... I think the words you used were: <em>How America could                  have sold its soul to the extent where it not only brought                  these Nazi scientists over to American shores to give them                  great jobs but actually, seemingly, embraced their whole agenda                  and took it much further?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Were there evil forces at work in America during the Second                  World War? Or was this something that was opportunistic because                  they realized the magic that they certainly held in their hands                  and thought that they could use this to their own ends, and                  it was too great a temptation to resist?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, I think, as usual, the causes take place on                  different levels simultaneously. I think to point in one direction                  only might be a mistake. I think sometimes it&rsquo;s desired                  that we do look in a certain direction and not look in another                  one -- the idea of misdirection. </p>                <p class="style7">I talk about <em>sinister forces</em>. I mean, that&rsquo;s                  the title of my series, and I took that title from Watergate                  because that&rsquo;s how I started this research. And &ldquo;sinister                  forces&rdquo; were blamed for that famous 18.5 minute tape                  gap on the Oval Office tapes, on Nixon&rsquo;s office tapes,                  where there was suddenly a big gap and no one knew what he                  had said. </p>                <p class="style7">I think it was Alexander Haig or Buzhardt who                  had said the tape, the hissing sound on the tape was the result                  of sinister forces. And I liked that idea, that there was something                  darker at work. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that in many cases what we see around us is theater,                  a kind of theater, and that there are forces that are deeper,                  darker, less visible, manipulating events. Or I like to think                  that what we call coincidence and synchronicity is evidence                  of the action of a darker force or a deeper force.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; And are these forces also much more ancient? Because                  of course there are many researchers, possibly yourself, who                  conclude that this whole thing, this whole dark agenda, had                  its roots 2,000 or even 3,000 years ago and it&rsquo;s been                  growing steadily since then.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well actually in your book you&rsquo;re talking                  about going back into the mounds in America, so you&rsquo;re                  going back thousands if not millions of years. Right?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Certainly.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s also the allusion to Egypt and                  the pyramids. And you&rsquo;re talking about, you actually                  have to get to possible off-world cultures, and how we humans,                  how humanity began on this planet, when you go that deep, really. </p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, when I started looking at the burial mounds...                  The idea of the Indian burial mounds came to me sheerly by                  accident, because I was researching Manson and I decided to                  go where Charles Manson had grown up, which was a town called                  Ashland in Kentucky. </p>                <p class="style7">I was struck by the fact that there were Indian burial mounds                  right in the center of town. And I started to research that,                  wondering what did that mean? I had never really come across                  this before. This was brand new to me. </p>                <p class="style7">I started to look at the fact that these mounds are all over                  the United States, especially east of the Mississippi, but                  also west of the Mississippi to a certain extent. </p>                <p class="style7">I was struck by the fact that there was actually an ancient                  civilization in America, in North America, that we have no                  clue about. It was just as ancient as anything that was taking                  place in the Middle East. The earthworks that they built were                  in some cases more grand and a lot larger than the pyramids,                  and we know so little about it. </p>                <p class="style7">I began to look at America as a kind of haunted house, and                  I began to ask myself: <em>What forces are there really at                  work here?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">The coincidences that we come across, especially a conspiracy                  theorist... Anybody who begins to investigate -- the Kennedy                  assassination is probably the most famous example -- will come                  across dozens and then hundreds and then maybe thousands of &ldquo;coincidental&rdquo; connections,                  between people, places, and events, which drives them crazy. </p>                <p class="style7">A regular historian, a mainstream historian&rsquo;s going                  to say: <em>Well, that was a coincidence; and that was a coincidence;                  and that was a coincidence,</em> and dismiss them all because                  he cannot see a real cause-and-effect relationship. </p>                <p class="style7">But to me, and it happens to all of us who investigate these                  things, we find ourselves bedeviled by these coincidences. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, I was researching <em>Sinister Forces</em> for a while                  in Asia. I was in Southeast Asia in remote areas and I would                  walk into an old second-hand bookstore and find books that                  I needed for my research. They were books maybe on Charles                  Manson or something that I had never heard of before. Scholarly                  texts would suddenly appear. Or texts would appear that had                  been written and printed privately by someone involved with                  the group that I call &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo;. </p>                <p class="style7">All of this stuff would fall into my hands even though I was                  in the middle of nowhere, nowhere near any sort of academic                  structure, nowhere near a Barnes and Noble bookstore or anything                  like that, [laughs] but just really in the middle of nowhere. </p>                <p class="style7">So the multiplication of these events, to me, is an indication                  that something else is at work, that maybe we need a quantum                  consciousness approach to history itself, not just to our own                  minds in a kind of theoretical way or a spiritual...</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely. Absolutely.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; History. Yep.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; You&rsquo;re talking about Puharich. I&rsquo;m not                  sure how you say his name.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Puharich.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Puharich.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And that opens a can of worms around the mind control                  and how the mind control itself seems to stem from those early                  beginnings and the consciousness that supposedly Puharich actually                  got into contact -- those &ldquo;Nine&rdquo; people -- of which                  there are people that have written books since then and gotten                  involved in supposedly being in contact with, if not those                  intelligences, then others. Some call them the <em>Giza Intelligences.</em> So                  it&rsquo;s all going back to somewhere back there, as well.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, yeah. I mean, if you begin with Puharich,                  you can see the contours of what I&rsquo;m talking about quite                  clearly, because here was a man who was a researcher into the                  paranormal, but he was also a captain in the U. S. Army and                  a medial doctor, all of these things all together. And this                  was all during the Korean War. </p>                <p class="style7">Here was a man who was giving lectures to the military on                  how to weaponize ESP, you know, how to use man&rsquo;s telekinetic                  and telepathic powers as a weapon in the fight in the Cold                  War. </p>                <p class="style7">At the same time, he&rsquo;s holding a s&eacute;ance or a                  series of s&eacute;ances at a farmhouse in Maine to which he&rsquo;s                  invited a handful of people. But the people he&rsquo;s invited                  are some of the wealthiest families in America, the most powerful                  families in America, &ldquo;blue-bloods&rdquo;, I mean, who                  are descended from the signers of the Declaration of Independence. </p>                <p class="style7">The thing that fascinates me about this is that this is thoroughly                  documented stuff. There&rsquo;s no speculation about this at                  all. Anyone can go and look it up and find out for themselves                  that these people did meet, they conducted the s&eacute;ance,                  they were in contact with some extraterrestrial or supernatural                  group of beings which called themselves &ldquo;The Nine.&rdquo; </p>                <p class="style7">And we&rsquo;re talking about people who were also tangentially                  involved in the Kennedy assassination which would take place                  ten, fifteen years after these events. I mean, it&rsquo;s stunning.                  I mean, you ask yourself: <em>What is the connection? How could                  this possibly be?</em></p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Yes. What did you think of Picknett and Prince&rsquo;s                  book, <em>The Stargate Conspiracy,</em> that you must have                  read as part of your research?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; I did read <em>The Stargate Conspiracy</em> and                  I wanted to shout at Picknett and Prince: <em>Just go a little                  bit further! Go just a little bit more and you will see the                  connections right back to the Kennedy assassination.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">I was thrilled that they were writing about these events,                  about &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo; also. They were writing about                  Puharich. They had mentioned him. They had mentioned this group,                  but they had not drawn the connection. They had not connected                  the dot between, for instance, Arthur Young, who was a prominent                  member of &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo;, a man who invented the Bell                  Helicopter, which I had mentioned just a little while ago as                  having been involved with Nazi scientists...</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; When you talk about &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo;, are                  you talking about a human group, or an off-world group? Or                  is this an allusion to two groups of nine?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, when I talk about &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo;,                  I&rsquo;m focusing first on the human group because those are                  the names of the people that we know. But of course they were                  considered to be the Earthly representatives of this spiritual                  or extraterrestrial group that called themselves &ldquo;The                  Nine.&rdquo;</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; OK. What is that Earthly group of nine?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo; included families --                  for instance, Arthur Young and his wife, Ruth Forbes Paine                  Young, who is a relative of John Kerry&rsquo;s, as a matter                  of fact &ndash; John Forbes Kerry.&nbsp; So we have Arthur                  Young and his wife, Ruth Forbes Paine Young. </p>                <p class="style7">We have a DuPont, we have an Astor, all as part of this group                  as well as Puharich. So the Astor family was there -- a very                  wealthy American and British family, the Astors. Of course                  everyone knows the Astors and the Waldorf Astoria, etcetera,                  etcetera. John Jacob Astor was on the <em>Titanic</em>. So                  we have the Astor family. </p>                <p class="style7">We have the DuPonts, of course &ndash; extremely powerful,                  wealthy, influential American family. And we have the Forbes                  -- as in <em>Forbes Magazine</em>, Steve Forbes, and all of                  that. That family was represented. </p>                <p class="style7">Her name was Ruth Forbes Paine. Paine was one of the original                  signers of the Declaration of Independence. She is a direct                  descent along that line by marriage. And Arthur Young himself,                  the inventor of the Bell Helicopter. </p>                <p class="style7">So you have a family grouping here of some of the most aristocratic                  family names in America. If we had royalty, they would DuPonts                  and Astors, Forbes, and Paines.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Did they call themselves &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo;?                  Or is this your term for them? I mean, did they have an agenda                  or some kind of thesis or reason for being together and were                  recognized as a group of that size?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, they called themselves &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo; in                  this fashion: They held a s&eacute;ance. Puharich was conducting                  a s&eacute;ance. He had a medium from India, a Dr. Vinod, and                  Vinod was in telepathic communication with a group of beings                  that was somehow in space, hovering over the Earth, and there                  were nine of them. </p>                <p class="style7">And they told the group of nine individuals: <em>We are nine,                    and you are nine, therefore you are the Brahmins who are                    going to bring a new wave of enlightenment, or a new wave                    of evolution to the planet. We&rsquo;re going to use you                    as our vehicle for causing this kind of spiritual evolution,                    this jumpstarting of evolution, if you will.</em></p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And this was also a take-off on basically what the                  Illuminati had been, their philosophy since the beginning of                  the group that we call the Illuminati, of which these families                  are all part?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s the implication. I mean, otherwise...                  Why are these people, as I said before, some of the wealthiest                  individuals in the United States, in Maine, in a barn, in the                  woods, on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, when they could have been anywhere                  else in the world? They had the money, they had the wherewithal,                  they had the connections. Instead, they&rsquo;re holding s&eacute;ances                  in the freezing cold, in the winter, in this barn. </p>                <p class="style7">What is the motivation for this? What is the purpose? How                  did they know each other? We don&rsquo;t know so much about                  that. We know that Puharich was the guy bringing them all together                  for the s&eacute;ance and they willingly went and took part                  in this endeavor, not just once but several times. </p>                <p class="style7">So their motivation, on their own? I don&rsquo;t know. I wouldn&rsquo;t                  want to speculate except to say we&rsquo;re talking about the                  most powerful people in our country at the time.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; And the analogy that you&rsquo;re drawing here is                  that there&rsquo;s good evidence that the Nazis were doing                  something similar, both before and during the war, and yet                  you&rsquo;re saying that this practice of powerful individuals                  from powerful families in a powerful nation-state are suddenly                  doing the same thing several decades later. </p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, yes. I mean, less than ten years later. If                  we count the end of World War Two as &rsquo;45, these people                  were meeting in the early 1950s. </p>                <p class="style7">And what Himmler was doing, himself... I went and visited                  in Germany the castle that he had renovated called Wewelsburg.                  It&rsquo;s near the town of Paderborn in Germany. And this                  castle was developed by him to be a kind of Vatican for the                  SS. It was going to be their spiritual headquarters. </p>                <p class="style7">He was conducting very similar rituals there. He had duplicated                  a kind of &ldquo;Roundtable&rdquo;, a sort of Arthurian, Camelot                  kind of idea. There would be 12 knights around it, which were                  the highest ranking SS officers. </p>                <p class="style7">They would gather in meditation at this table, in a room which                  was directly over a crypt, and in the crypt would be placed                  urns containing the ashes of SS officers as they died, the                  high ranking ones. There was special niche for each one. There                  were swastikas engraved in the floors, and the whole nine yards. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, the similar idea of meditation, of trying to contact                  supernatural beings to guide the SS, was now being duplicated                  by a group called &ldquo;The Nine.&rdquo; </p>                <p class="style7">And if we think in terms of race -- you know the SS, like                  all the Nazis, were obsessed with race and racial purity --                  suddenly with &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo; we have, as I said, the                  blue-blood of American families, DuPonts, Astors, Paines, Forbes.                  We have this gathering of the... for want of a better word,                  the most racially acceptable, to the Nazis, grouping in guided                  meditations in the woods doing the same thing. Except there                  were not twelve in this case. There were nine, very specifically. </p>                <p class="style7">So I&rsquo;m not trying to draw too close a connection between                  what the Nazis were doing and &ldquo;The Nine.&rdquo; The practices                  were quite similar. It was a group s&eacute;ance. It was a                  meditation. It was something to do with evolution of the race.                  So you have a lot of the same themes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. But what you also, I think, continued to investigate                  is to find out where that information that they were receiving                  from &ldquo;The Nine&rdquo; went from there. Because I believe                  there is a trail that connects through SRI [ed note: Stanford                  Research Institute] and Hal Puthoff and Ingo                  Swann...</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; ...remote viewing, and actually then circles back                  and also has to do with people that were involved in mind control                  then utilizing some of that information? And/or is it guiding,                  for example, the agenda of the Illuminati to this day?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, it certainly did make that route that you                  just described, and the connective tissue in all of this, of                  course, is Andrija Puharich. Puharich was the man largely credited                  with having discovered Uri Geller, for instance, the famous                  Israeli psychic. He brought Geller to SRI in California to                  be tested. </p>                <p class="style7">There was also a connection with SRI and that grouping, with                  the people at Jonestown. The connections are vast with all                  of this, and if you start pulling at the threads, you become                  extremely paranoid.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the connection with Jonestown?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, yes. In <em>Volume Two</em> I have about 100                  pages alone just on Jonestown because the amount of work that                  has yet to be done just to decode that event is still leaning                  on us. We really know very little about what really happened                  at Jonestown. </p>                <p class="style7">Slowly but surely more and more information has been revealed                  over the last 20 years or so, some of it by a good friend of                  mine called Jim Hogan, an investigative journalist who spent                  a lot of time researching Jonestown and came up with some of                  the CIA documents to verify that Jim Jones himself was some                  kind of contract agent with the CIA. He had what&rsquo;s called                  a <em>201 File</em> at CIA. So we know there was a connection                  there. </p>                <p class="style7">But as far as the connection with SRI, I think it was Russell                  Targ -- if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, I believe it&rsquo;s Russell                  Targ who was the man who was involved with both Jonestown and                  SRI and Hal Puthoff. </p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC: &nbsp;There&rsquo;s also the link back to Puharich as                  working for the CIA.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Yes. As far as Uri Geller was concerned, Geller                  always said that Puharich was his handler for the CIA. He made                  that statement several times. </p>                <p class="style7">But as far as SRI&rsquo;s concerned, Russell Targ, the physicist                  who was part of the SRI group, by his own admission was involved                  with a group of Jonestown survivors. He was director of counseling                  at their Human Freedom Center in Berkeley and left them to                  join SRI to study psychic phenomena. </p>                <p class="style7">The group that he was working with, Elmer and Deanna Mertle,                  after he left them, a few weeks after Targ left them to join                  SRI, the Mertles were found dead, murdered execution-style                  in their home. So the connection between Targ, SRI, and Jonestown                  is definite. What it means, we don&rsquo;t know. </p>                <p class="style7">But we do know that Targ worked with the Mertles, which was                  a group of survivors of the Jonestown massacre, people who                  had left the Jim Jones church, The People&rsquo;s Temple, and                  were trying to raise consciousness against it. They had written                  a book about The People&rsquo;s Temple and Targ was working                  with them. He left to join SRI and a couple of weeks later,                  the Mertles were dead, murdered execution-style.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So you have to also say that with all of this what                  happens is some people will fall on working for the positive                  and some will be working actually for the negative agenda,                  within the fact that there are connections between these organizations                  -- because there is very definite connection between the CIA                  and SRI. And between Puharich and CIA. So you get all these                  connections with CIA. Gordon Novel, the Kennedy assassination.                  All of these link back to the CIA. So it gets really convoluted.                  It&rsquo;s really fascinating. </p>                <p class="style7">I know that you&rsquo;ve studied the occult in great depth.                  Have you come to any conclusions? Are you going down some trails                  now that perhaps are not publicized? </p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, not publicized to the point that I don&rsquo;t                  quite know how to explain all of this yet in any way that makes                  any kind of sense from an academic point of view, but it has                  occurred to me during this kind of research... As I mentioned                  before, I consider coincidence and synchronicity to be evidence                  of the operation of these forces. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that these forces are there and I think that groups                  of human beings from time to time make a conscious effort to                  contact these forces, to manipulate them, to use them for their                  own advantages. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that the CIA did that with <em>MKULTRA</em> and <em>Operation                    Bluebird</em> and all of the mind control experiments they                    did. </p>                <p class="style7">If you take a human being and you try to manipulate their                  consciousness, you try to erase their memories, replace their                  memories, program them as assassins, as an example, then what                  you&rsquo;re doing is, you&rsquo;re essentially initiating                  that human being. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, you&rsquo;re putting them through a kind of spiritual                  initiation, but with none of the safeguards, with none of the                  spiritual preparation that a person would normally go through                  to become protected against whatever demons are invoked in                  the process. So it was a very irresponsible, callous, cruel                  program that the CIA had undertaken at that time.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Irresponsible or actually intentional? I mean, that&rsquo;s                  really the question, isn&rsquo;t it, of the heads of the CIA,                  If they knew what they were getting into? And they were invoking                  these negative forces, in essence, and bringing them into the                  bodies of programmed assassins -- and some of which are actually                  sleeper agents that may indeed be part of our society at the                  moment, sitting around waiting to be triggered. </p>                <p class="style7">In essence what you&rsquo;re looking at could be an intentional                  agenda. And that&rsquo;s where it gets very interesting when                  you&rsquo;re starting to look at the future and what we&rsquo;re                  actually faced with.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, yeah. I mean, I think one of the good indications                  of just how bad it got was the man who was for a long time                  in charge of this program at the CIA, called Sydney Gottlieb,                  Dr. Sydney Gottlieb...&nbsp; When the <em>MKULTRA</em> project                  was &ldquo;disbanded&rdquo; by Richard Helms in the mid-1970s,                  Gottlieb went a little weird. He at one point became a Buddhist                  monk. He went to India. He tried to essentially pay for his                  sins. </p>                <p class="style7">He wouldn&rsquo;t talk about this program anymore but he became                  a kind of recluse and was obviously trying to live simply.                  He was living off the land. He was living in a farmhouse, I                  believe in Virginia, after he came back from India. He was                  a man who was shattered by the realizations of what he had                  done, by the sins that he had committed against other human                  beings. </p>                <p class="style7">So if the leader, if the creator, or the handmaiden of this                  operation felt that way, I wonder what the actual day-to-day                  perpetrators felt, the people who were actually involved in                  the day-to-day programming of these individuals. </p>                <p class="style7">I think there is a tremendous amount of evidence to suggest                  that Sirhan Sirhan was just exactly one of those assassins                  who had been created. I&rsquo;ve gone through Sirhan&rsquo;s                  diaries, the diaries he was keeping up to the point he was                  arrested for the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; And he has no idea what happened, does he?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t. I mean, he admits he did it because                  he figures, you know, he did it. I mean, if he&rsquo;s arrested                  for it and he was there, he must have done it. But he has no                  memory of it. And his diaries are extremely suggestive of someone                  who&rsquo;s been through a behavior modification program, something                  like a mind control program. It&rsquo;s fascinating stuff.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; I read a wonderful book which I&rsquo;ve got. I                  also had the experience of what I guess you could call the                  International Library Angel suddenly depositing a book at your                  feet when you&rsquo;re traveling. [laughs] It was a book by                  Long John Nebel who was the Art Bell radio host of his day,                  who operated in the 1950s, who wrote an amazing book about                  the Control of Candy Jones. You must be familiar with that.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Yeah, I do. I&rsquo;m fascinated by that account                  as well and I think it&rsquo;s genuine. It&rsquo;s been attacked,                  of course, by other researchers and authors by saying that                  Long John Nebel kind of made it up or Candy Jones never went                  through this. </p>                <p class="style7">But if you really go through as I do, which is the thing that                  I do, is I go through and I try to document what goes on. I                  met Candy Jones a couple of years before she died. I was actually                  interviewed by her on radio in New York City. </p>                <p class="style7">And from my point of view, what she discusses, especially                  her trips in Asia and Taiwan, have the absolute ring of truth.                  I mean, I lived in Asia for a long time. I traveled in those                  countries. The things that she discusses I believe actually                  did occur. I think that she did not make them up. I can recognize                  the places she&rsquo;s talking about.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; I read that book several times and it rang very,                  very true to me.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Yeah. It was not a sensationalistic thing that she                  was making up. I really do believe what she said happened had                  happened.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So where are you going now with everything? Because                  you don&rsquo;t really keep your blog up. You had been talking                  about McCain as a possible mind control victim, and I think                  there&rsquo;s great evidence to that effect. I&rsquo;d be interested                  to hear what you have to say about Obama. I don&rsquo;t know                  what your current situation is. The Powers That Be, are they                  aware of you? Have they made your life difficult? Because you                  seem to be one of the best researchers actually pulling these                  threads together in one place.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; And what does this mean for us at the beginning                  of 2009, looking at the next few years, and what this may mean                  for this country and the world? </p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Yeah. These are very good questions. I took a little                  time out for a while to get a graduate degree in religion and                  the thesis that I wrote, I published as <em>Stairway to Heaven,</em> which                  came out about a year ago. I have another book on the Freemasons                  which is coming out in April. I&rsquo;ve kept my hand in all                  of this but I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of academic-type work                  on the one hand, and then a lot of investigative work, on the                  other. </p>                <p class="style7">The political situation: The way I look at it these days,                  as I mentioned before, is theater. It is basically theater.                  We are watching a play being acted out in front of us, and                  we&rsquo;re all willing or unwilling audience members in this                  play. </p>                <p class="style7">I think we have to not believe a lot of what we see, as being &ldquo;real.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s                  a kind of consensus reality. We all kind of agree that certain                  things are real and certain things are not. </p>                <p class="style7">And I always like to talk about the root of the word <em>reality</em>,                  because the word comes from a very interesting Indo-European                  root which also gives us <em>royal</em>. It gives us what is <em>real</em> and                  what is <em>royal</em>. And basically what that means is, to                  me: &ldquo;Whatever the king says is real is real.&rdquo; </p>                <p class="style7">In other words, there&rsquo;s a kind of agreement that we                  all enter into, a kind of contract where we agree that certain                  things are, and certain things are not, <em>real</em>. And                  I think we&rsquo;ve come to the point where we have to revisit                  what we call <em>real</em>. We have to revisit reality to a                  certain extent. We have to come up with a new paradigm, a new                  way of looking at reality, because it&rsquo;s not working for                  us, the old way of looking at it.</p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;re too easily manipulated. Our country has made a                  science of the manipulation of reality since at least the Korean                  War, if not before. </p>                <p class="style7">Communication science, which is being taught in the universities                  all across the country, came into being as a result of World                  War Two and psychological warfare studies. I mean, the same                  guys who created psychological warfare for use during the war                  were the guys who in the private sector developed programs                  for teaching advertising, marketing, and communication. </p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; So we are really struggling with psychological warfare                  being directed against by manipulating our reality. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. A form of propaganda and mind control in                  and of itself, just as television becomes in a sense a mind                  control tool.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; On a massive, massive scale. I used to live, as                  I mentioned, in Asia, and we would get CNN out there. I don&rsquo;t                  want to single out CNN particularly for opprobrium, but they                  are sort of an international news organization that you can                  pick up on cable channels all over the world. </p>                <p class="style7">There was one particular instance where I&rsquo;m in Kuala                  Lumpur and there was a riot going on on CNN, on television,                  in a restaurant. It was being carried live. And we&rsquo;re                  looking at the television screen, and we&rsquo;re at the site                  where this riot is supposed to be taking place. And there&rsquo;s                  no riot there! [Kerry laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;re watching and we&rsquo;re all looking at each other.                  We&rsquo;re watching the screen and we&rsquo;re saying: <em>What                  is this?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">It turns out there were three or four people in a corner somewhere                  and a camera was on them. And the way it looked, it looked                  as if there were all of these really angry people rioting. </p>                <p class="style7">I was getting a phone call from friends of mine saying: <em>Go                    away! Get out! There&rsquo;s a riot taking place. We can                    see it on television.</em> And we&rsquo;re all sitting in                    the restaurant saying: <em>Well, where&rsquo;s the riot?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">You know, there is no riot. I mean, it was manufactured news,                  essentially. And if that happened that one time, how many other                  times has this happened? How much of our news is being manipulated                  or controlled or created, you know, as we watch it? </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right, but as a researcher going into this as deeply                  as you have, you must be able to look towards the future and                  come to certain conclusions, and / or think about certain uninvestigated                  trails to look down. </p>                <p class="style7">I am curious: Do you think, for example, there are sleeper                  agents? Because, you know, we keep having these incidents happen                  and they seem to be evidence of mind control operations, in                  which you have school kids suddenly flipping out, and so on                  and so forth. Where&rsquo;s it all headed?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, if we characterize the agents of this madness                  as individual human beings, we might be missing something darker                  and something deeper. I believe that there are individual agents,                  of course, and that&rsquo;s what I investigate. That&rsquo;s                  what I write about. That&rsquo;s where the evidence leads me. </p>                <p class="style7">But sometimes I think that there is something else at work                  here. I think that there is a kind of level of consciousness                  that is creating this for us as well, and that we&rsquo;re                  victims of it because we haven&rsquo;t learned how to fight                  back. We haven&rsquo;t learned how to take control of our own                  consciousness. We&rsquo;re essentially allowing others to do                  that for us. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that we have a kind of responsibility, perhaps now                  more than ever, because the information is available to us,                  of fighting back by taking control of our own minds, and taking                  back control of our own consciousness, of trying to deprogram                  ourselves, if you will, away from what we&rsquo;re being fed                  on an almost hysterical basis. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, things have ramped up to the point where paranoia,                  fear, anxiety, stress levels have increased so exponentially,                  it&rsquo;s as if someone <em>wants</em> us to have this collective                  nervous breakdown. We have to take a stand and fight against                  it. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that if my research has shown nothing [else], it&rsquo;s                  shown that humans who are involved in this quite often don&rsquo;t                  really understand it that well themselves. I&rsquo;m talking                  about the CIA. </p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t think that the people who ran <em>MKULTRA</em> really                  understood the full ramifications of what they were doing.                  They had a very narrow focus. They wanted to create deniable                  assassins, as an example, and that was their focus. They didn&rsquo;t                  realize the other forces they were unleashing at the time. </p>                <p class="style7">And I think that there are paths, there are shamanistic paths,                  there are paths in the occult that might be actually beneficial                  for us to investigate to understand how we&rsquo;ve been manipulated,                  how our consciousness has been manipulated, our reality itself                  has been manipulated. I think we have a chance because there                  is such an amount of information available. </p>                <p class="style7">But we are headed into a very dangerous impasse, a very dangerous                  place. I agree. But I think that we don&rsquo;t realize how                  much power we have as individual human beings, or as small                  groups of individual human beings, to combat this madness.                  And I think we <em>can</em> take back our minds and our lives                  from these forces, from these sinister forces.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Are you able to say anything, do you feel, about                  the role of the Vatican?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Ah... [laughter] How much time do you have?</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; You know about the work of Eric Phelps and that                  large body of research that he, among many others, represents.                  I just wondered if you could pull some of those threads together                  once again for the benefit of our listeners who would like                  to see as much of a summary of the big picture as you are able                  to present here.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Right. I grew up as a Roman Catholic. I was born                  into a Catholic family in the pre-Vatican II days. And when                  Vatican II happened, I was actually kind of disappointed. I                  didn&rsquo;t like all of the, you know, guitar-playing Masses                  that were taking place and all this stuff. I felt a little                  cheated of the mystery, somehow. </p>                <p class="style7">But then, as I started to research the Nazi information, that&rsquo;s                  when Phase One of my disenchantment or dis-enlightenment, or                  whatever you want to call it, took place. </p>                <p class="style7">And that was understanding the degree to which elements within                  the Vatican had assisted war criminals with hideous records                  to escape; how they protected them at safe-houses throughout                  Europe and then in Latin America; how they gave them Vatican                  passports; how we had the spectacle of Nazi war criminals dressed                  as priests entering Argentina, entering Brazil, in one case                  performing a marriage ceremony as a priest. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, I can&rsquo;t even imagine what that poor family would                  have felt, had they known that it was a man responsible for                  the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people blessing                  their union as a fake priest. So all of this began to... that                  was Phase One.</p>                <p class="style7">Phase Two was realizing that what we&rsquo;ve been told about                  Christianity itself, particularly about the Catholic Church,                  is based on so much disinformation and so much manipulation                  of history and historical facts that we really don&rsquo;t                  know what the Catholic Church is any more, or what it ever                  was. We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on there. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, the Vatican scandals... The Masonic scandals, the                  Propaganda Due, the P2 Masonic scandal alone should have alerted                  people to the degree of perfidy and cupidity that was taking                  place within the Vatican. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, we had Licio Gelli and Roberto Calvi, all of these                  characters who were heavily involved in the Vatican and at                  the same time financing right-wing terror squads, assassination                  squads, in Europe, in Latin America, working with Francisco                  Franco -- the dictator of Spain for so many years -- heavily                  involved with fascist organizations and operations. </p>                <p class="style7">It was mind-numbing, the extent to which this was taking place.                  So I have a very hard time. You know, I&rsquo;m thankfully                  a very lapsed Catholic. You know, I want to stay that way.                  I can&rsquo;t believe that I would go to the Bishops, Archbishops                  of the Catholic Church and accept spiritual guidance from people                  whose own morals and ethics I have to question on almost a                  daily basis.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, also there&rsquo;s a link between the Vatican,                  the Illuminati, and the US government, apparently. Can you                  talk about that a little bit? Because when you&rsquo;re talking                  about the Nazi influence in America, and you&rsquo;re talking                  also about The Powers That Be with <em>Paperclip</em>, the                  Ultimate Space Program, and all of the levels at which the                  Vatican is involved... From what I understand their secret                  service was basically the model upon which secret services                  all over the world have been built. </p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, sure. In fact, even the SS... the Nazis emulated                  the Jesuits. I mean, Himmler wanted to create a Jesuit Order                  for himself, and that was what the SS was, hence the black                  uniforms, and the rituals in the churches, and the rituals                  at night in the forests, and all this other stuff. It was a                  kind of pagan Jesuit Order that Himmler was trying to create. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, people may have disliked or even hated the Catholic                  Church or the Vatican, but there was so much of it that they                  wanted to emulate, that they wanted to duplicate. But the problem                  is that we have so much information to discuss that it would                  take hours to get into it. I&rsquo;ll just bring up one or                  two points that will be enough to scare you, and probably... </p>                <p class="style7">I think the place to look in the beginning, if you want to                  see the connection between the Vatican, Nazis, and even the                  Illuminati, would be the Knights of Malta and some of the other                  chivalric orders that the Vatican maintains and supports. </p>                <p class="style7">I won&rsquo;t even go into Opus Dei which is a whole other                  kettle of fish by itself. I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about                  a man who created that order who had pro-fascist, pro-Franco                  sentiments. I mean, there&rsquo;s no question about it. And                  how he could be canonized is absolutely beyond me. </p>                <p class="style7">But anyway, look at the Knights of Malta. Look at the connection                  between the leaders of the CIA, many of whom were Roman Catholics,                  members of the Knights of Malta or members of one of the other                  chivalric orders around the Vatican. </p>                <p class="style7">When I was growing up in the Bronx in the 1960s, I saw with                  my own eyes the influence that churches had with intelligence                  agencies, and intelligence agencies with the churches. I mean,                  I witnessed it as a young man of 18, 19 years old, working                  with a church in the Bronx that was heavily involved with intelligence                  operations, which was actually a front for intelligence operations. </p>                <p class="style7">And that brings us back again to David Ferrie and Jack Martin                  and the Kennedy assassinations, because I met the Bishops who                  ordained and consecrated David Ferrie, Jack Martin, all these                  peripheral figures that you saw in the movie <em>JFK</em>,                  you know, being played by Joe Pesche, being played by Walter                  Matthau, I think. </p>                <p class="style7">These were people who were heavily involved in a church. They                  were also involved in intelligence activities. They were also                  involved in anti-Castro Cuban activities and considered to                  be involved, in one way, shape, or form, with the assassination                  of a president in Dallas. </p>                <p class="style7">So the nexus between religious organizations and intelligence                  organizations is thick. It&rsquo;s just thick, you know. </p>                <p class="style7">And like I say, I saw it with my own eyes. I know the church                  that Ferrie and Martin belonged to in 1968 when Jim Garrison                  was starting ramping up that investigation into the Kennedy                  assassination. David Ferrie died mysteriously, but he was a                  priest and a Bishop with one of these churches. So...</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you also get into, maybe, what&rsquo;s                  going on with the agenda, in terms of how this plays out? For                  example, in the economy of the world going downhill, and the                  desire for the One World Government. And how there&rsquo;re                  certain problems being created so that a solution can be created,                  as you know possibly David Icke&rsquo;s work in that area? </p>                <p class="style7">So what I&rsquo;m wondering is, are you following those threads?                  Obviously you see the economy going down in America and around                  the world. There are sacrifices, blood sacrifices. Some of                  these things, or maybe even all of them, are actually <em>planned</em> as                  some kinds of sacrifices to these hidden, dark entities in                  order to make certain things happen upon this planet.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, if we don&rsquo;t characterize the economic                  situation as a purely economic situation, I think we can see                  more clearly what&rsquo;s taking place. In a previous era,                  this might have been a vast military conflict. It might have                  been a World War Three, or a World War Four or something. </p>                <p class="style7">Now we&rsquo;re fighting that same war but we&rsquo;re using                  economics to do it. This is a different approach to the same                  type of general control that&rsquo;s being exerted over the                  world. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, the whole world cannot go broke. The money is somewhere.                  That&rsquo;s the funny thing. The humorous part of this thing,                  if you want to be funny about it... that fact, you know, we&rsquo;re                  thinking the whole world economy is going down. But basically                  what happens, especially with capitalism, is somebody gets                  rich and somebody gets poor. So who&rsquo;s getting rich? </p>                <p class="style7">During Watergate we were told to follow the money. And I think                  if we follow the money today, we can find out who&rsquo;s doing                  what to whom. We can find out who&rsquo;s actually doing this                  kind of control. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;ve been looking at it. I&rsquo;ve been trying. Following                  the money in today&rsquo;s economy is extremely difficult to                  do. I think even members of congress are finding themselves                  totally unable to even explain what&rsquo;s happening. Some                  of them are not able. Some of them are strictly not willing. </p>                <p class="style7">But if we can follow the money, if we can start pulling the                  threads on the money over the last 12 to 18 months, we can                  probably figure out who&rsquo;s behind this thing. </p>                <p class="style7">For me, it&rsquo;s been very difficult to do although I&rsquo;ve                  been trying to cover it. I think the answer is out there. I                  think, as Fox Mulder used to say: <em>The truth is out there</em>.                  But we have to look at the evidence, and the evidence is there.                  It&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s very hard to figure out.</p>                <p class="style7">If we&rsquo;re talking about manipulation of the world economy,                  it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re being prepared for something                  else. Obviously there&rsquo;s an agenda. It&rsquo;s not strictly                  to make some people rich at the expense of others. That&rsquo;s                  been going on forever. We don&rsquo;t need a collapse in the                  world economy to do that. </p>                <p class="style7">So if a collapse is being engineered in the world economy,                  it&rsquo;s to create a circumstance or a set of circumstances                  conducive to another phase of action which has nothing to do                  with the economy. As you said, it might be a One World Government                  -- possibly. It might be something more heinous than that. </p>                <p class="style7">A collapse of the economy may be a way to keep in place the                  types of controls that were put into our government during                  the last eight years. It may be a way of preempting any kind                  of change that we thought we were voting for -- some of us                  anyway. So there may be a way to... </p>                <p class="style7">As 9/11 essentially was a Reichstag fire which gave the president                  total control of the government, in terms of the Patriot Act                  and everything else, the collapse in the economy is essentially                  another 9/11, and it&rsquo;s going to give the government additional                  powers that it never had.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just another kind of controlled demolition.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s another kind of controlled demolition.                  It&rsquo;s a... what&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for...                  a consolidation of all of this. </p>                <p class="style7">If we put the Patriot Act and some of the other things that                  took place -- the wiretaps, the illegal stuff that&rsquo;s                  been going on -- and we now couple that with government control                  of banks and corporations, you know, we have fascism. </p>                <p class="style7">Some people are talking about creating socialism or communism                  here, but fascism is also a wedding between the state and the                  corporation. It&rsquo;s not just socialism that we&rsquo;re                  talking about. </p>                <p class="style7">The one thing that nobody wants to talk about is the fact                  that we&rsquo;ve been creeping closer and closer to fascism                  in the last 40 or 50 years. And that scares me, believe it                  or not, more than socialism does or even communism. What frightens                  me most is a kind of fascism, an American style of fascism. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, I mean, this is the premise of Jim Marrs&rsquo; book,                  as you know.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And it is a basically a <em>fait accompli</em> in                  the minds of many, even behind the scenes, with Richard Hoagland                  and his investigation into NASA and the symbolism there, and                  the <em>Paperclip</em> background behind, you know, the space                  program. So the agenda seems to have been a kind of fascism                  that stemmed out of World War Two and is being continued today. </p>                <p class="style7">But where is that going? Once they have total control, then                  what? You know, it&rsquo;s almost like they already have total                  control as it is. One wonders: What next? </p>                <p class="style7">And the only thing we&rsquo;ve gotten so far in our study                  of this mystery is the idea of population elimination. In other                  words, they want to eliminate large segments of the population.                  They haven&rsquo;t been able to do so with other means, with                  viruses and so on. </p>                <p class="style7">In other words, this control you&rsquo;re talking about has                  to lead to some <em>thing</em>, because control is something                  they&rsquo;ve, in a sense, always had. But they&rsquo;re tightening                  it, and as you say, they&rsquo;re consolidating it. So with                  what purpose in mind?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s another good question and it&rsquo;s                  something, too, that would probably take a long time to try                  to analyze. I think that &ldquo;The Powers That Be&rdquo; are                  not 100% happy yet. They don&rsquo;t really feel they have                  the kind of control they would like. </p>                <p class="style7">Part of the reason for that is the explosion of technology,                  which seems to be getting out of control. You don&rsquo;t notice                  it perhaps as much in this country as you would overseas where                  this kind of technology, the internet in particular, has given                  people at the grassroots level a voice they never had before. </p>                <p class="style7">So the governments in those parts of the world, especially                  in developing countries, are struggling very hard to control                  the technology and control access to information. </p>                <p class="style7">Right now we are talking over the internet and this will be                  available on the internet, so people who want to can hear it.                  But this kind of control eventually will probably have to be                  extended over what we&rsquo;re doing over the internet, over                  the free exchange of information. </p>                <p class="style7">I think it&rsquo;s already started and I think it&rsquo;s                  going to continue until there is control over information.                  And once you control information, you control reality. You                  control consciousness. Once the independent operators are gone,                  once they&rsquo;ve been closed down, there will only be the                  party line that&rsquo;s left.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s <em>1984</em>, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, it is <em>1984</em>. Some people listening                  to this are gonna say to themselves: <em>You know, these are                  the aluminum hat people.</em> You know, the tin-foil hats.                  We&rsquo;re all worried about vast conspiracies taking control. </p>                <p class="style7">I want to tell you something, to the listeners who maybe think                  that at times this is out in left field. I was on somewhat                  friendly terms with a man called Norman Mailer, a famous author,                  one of America&rsquo;s most famous novelists and journalists                  and authors, who passed away recently -- a man I admired very                  much. He was kind enough to praise my own work and write a                  foreword to <em>Unholy Alliance</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">He spoke in my presence about the fact that America was heading                  towards fascism. Many people of that social setting, other                  authors, some of them Pulitzer Prize-winning authors, people                  who are understood to be great thinkers, great members of the <em>intelligencia</em>,                  have all said the same thing to me or in my presence, that                  we are heading towards fascism, that America... </p>                <p class="style7">According to Norman mailer, back a couple of years ago, he                  said America was in what he called a pre-fascist condition,                  but that we were heading inexorably towards fascism. Other                  authors since then have said the same thing. </p>                <p class="style7">So this is not something that only a handful of people on                  the absolute fringe are feeling. These are things that are                  being felt on other levels by other people who are not involved                  in this kind of investigation, people who are not doing this                  kind of research, people who have just opened their eyes and                  who&rsquo;ve looked around and said: <em>My goodness, this                  is what&rsquo;s going on. We&rsquo;re becoming a fascist country.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; One of the things that confuses people sometimes,                  as you must be well aware, is the idea that somehow there&rsquo;s                  a spectrum with socialism on the left and fascism on the right                  and the two are very different. Actually, they meet in the                  middle, kind of loop round in a kind of circle, one going to                  the left and one going to the right. Extreme socialism and                  extreme fascism are actually very similar.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the point I was just going to make.                  To have fascism or to have socialism, you have to have a marriage                  between the state and business. I mean, that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s                  done. </p>                <p class="style7">Either the government owns the means of production as it does                  in a socialist or a communist country, or the state and the                  corporations have a working relationship, a nice working relationship,                  as Eisenhower warned us about when he left office. He talked                  about the military / industrial complex and how frightened                  he was that that was happening. That is fascism. </p>                <p class="style7">So, does it matter to the average person whether or not the                  government owns the means of production or the government and                  the state and the corporations are in bed together? Does it                  really matter to us on the street? </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s going to be the same effect. We&rsquo;re still                  going to be controlled. Our economy&rsquo;s going to be controlled.                  Our freedoms are going to be drastically curtailed. So in the                  end, what difference does it make?</p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;ve talked to people about 9/11 a lot. There&rsquo;s                  been, of course, a lot of discussion about 9/11. And I&rsquo;ve                  always said it was a Reichstag fire. It&rsquo;s what happened                  in Germany. How Hitler took complete control of the government                  was the Reichstag burned down and he blamed the communists                  for it. </p>                <p class="style7">And my point was, do we really care who burned down the Reichstag                  at this point? All we really care about is the fact that it                  brought Hitler to power. </p>                <p class="style7">So in our case, what did 9/11 do? It pushed all of these heinous                  attacks on our liberty and our privacy. It pushed them right                  into the forefront. It made it acceptable. That&rsquo;s what                  happened. That was the real effect of all of this. </p>                <p class="style7">We can talk about 9/11 -- for instance, we can talk about                  conspiracies. But let&rsquo;s not lose sight of the fact that                  what happened, the effect of it, was that we lost more liberty,                  we lost more privacy. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. And so then that gets back to the overall                  agenda.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Yes</p>                <p class="style7">KC: &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s not a conspiracy theory. It&rsquo;s                  a conspiracy fact when you look at all the evidence. And what&rsquo;s                  happening is that this particular agenda is being rolled out. </p>                <p class="style7">And, of course, it&rsquo;s very heartening that you do talk                  about how consciousness and the role of consciousness was getting                  out of the hands of the people in <em>MKULTRA</em>, such that                  people like Gottlieb himself, who was certainly one of the                  masterminds behind all of that, goes on his own sojourn to                  India, looking for some kind of spiritual way out, I think,                  of the responsibility for which he... You know, it&rsquo;s                  basically like walking around in some kind of living hell,                  I&rsquo;m sure, being inside that guy&rsquo;s head. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, in essence, all of this is playing out in the microcosm                  around the globe, not just America, because I see it in many                  countries. In fact, England has the best surveillance system                  on the streets, cameras, etcetera. So what&rsquo;s happening                  is, on some level it seems to be manifesting in America sort                  of in a more overt way. But in a covert way, it&rsquo;s actually                  existed in small countries, under despots that were financed                  by the CIA, and then across the globe, masterminding the governments                  behind countries like Switzerland, and so on. </p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Well, I mean, what&rsquo;s very amusing to me in                  a sardonic sort of way is the fact that in the United States                  if you talk about conspiracies, you&rsquo;re pooh-poohed. You&rsquo;re                  shot down. It&rsquo;s considered, you know, paranoid fantasy. </p>                <p class="style7">And yet we recognize without hesitation the fact that conspiracies                  like this exist in every other country on the planet. Right?                  So when Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan,                  was gunned down last year in Pakistan, everyone said of course                  it was a conspiracy. There were elements of the Pakistani secret                  police involved. Al Quaeda may be involved, or the Taliban,                  or who knows what. But automatically it was a conspiracy. </p>                <p class="style7">However, according to mainstream historians, not a single                  person assassinated in this country has ever been assassinated                  by a conspiracy! [laughs]&nbsp; No conspiracy. Nothing to see                  here. Move along. Right? We have this idea somehow that the                  U. S. is immune to these events. </p>                <p class="style7">And yet we overthrow dictators in foreign countries. We&rsquo;ve                  overthrown and committed assassinations in Guatemala, in Iran                  back in the days of the Shah. We overthrew the government of                  Allende in Chile. We put Pinochet in power. All of these things                  we do on a regular basis and we&rsquo;ve done it for years                  and years and years. And yet somehow it doesn&rsquo;t take                  place inside the United States. Why is that? Why is it so impossible                  to believe?</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. And I think, though, nowadays it&rsquo;s                  a lot easier to sort of get people to, not so much believe,                  but really understand the roots of conspiracy. And ever since                  the death of Kennedy I think that America&rsquo;s eyes have                  slowly been opened along those lines, at least many. Although                  certainly 9/11, you still get people not able to accept the                  possibility that a conspiracy took place there. </p>                <p class="style7">So again, I guess we&rsquo;ve gone full circle with you. In                  many ways we&rsquo;re going over some material here that is                  just... the roots are everywhere. The conspiracies, if you                  will, are everywhere. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s very heartening to know that you are behind the                  wheel, investigating all of this and documenting it and pulling                  as many threads together as you are. I encourage people to                  follow your work. I certainly want to read a lot more that                  you&rsquo;ve written.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Where I&rsquo;m going now? I&rsquo;m still in the                  midst of all of this, you know? I&rsquo;m still in the midst                  of researching. I don&rsquo;t know what my next book will be. </p>                <p class="style7">As I had mentioned, I have a book on Freemasons coming out                  in April, which is kind of a look at the connection between                  the Masonic society and the Mormons, and some of the occultism                  that was taking place in our country before, during, and after                  the Revolution, the American Revolution. So I look at the connections                  that were there. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s kind of a general look at Freemasonry. I&rsquo;m                  not a Freemason myself, of course. That&rsquo;s coming out                  in April. </p>                <p class="style7"><em>Stairway to Heaven</em> was really more about Kabbalah                  and Chinese alchemy and that sort of thing, a very spiritually                  oriented book trying to understand some of the implications                  of some of the ancient writings. </p>                <p class="style7">So, where I&rsquo;m going to go from here? I&rsquo;m constantly                  collecting information. I&rsquo;m constantly building up files                  of data, trying to see more connections, and I&rsquo;m sure                  I&rsquo;ll have something like this to share with you soon.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s fabulous. One thing I do want to ask                  you, the book you were talking about that you investigated                  the occult quite deeply...</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; I was involved with it. Yeah. <em>The Necronomicon.</em> Of                  course. I mean, I made no secret of that. I&rsquo;ve done some                  interviews based on that. That was an occult work that, I think                  today it&rsquo;s one of the critical texts, probably, of the                  mid-20th century on occultism. It&rsquo;s been reviled by a                  lot of people. People claim it&rsquo;s a hoax. Other people                  say it&rsquo;s a very terrible book, or it&rsquo;s a very powerful                  work. </p>                <p class="style7">I look at it as the survival of an old Middle Eastern occult                  practice which involved a process of initiations, going through                  a series of &ldquo;gates&rdquo;, gaining greater and greater                  illumination or enlightenment at each time, each passing of                  the &ldquo;gate&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s an interesting book and                  the events around it were interesting as well.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have to revisit that with you because                  I&rsquo;m fascinated by that as well.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, thank you, Peter. This has been fascinating.                  We&rsquo;re both really very interested in what you&rsquo;re                  gonna be doing in the future, as well as to get into your work                  after this conversation. And thank you for taking the time                  today to talk to us.</p>                <p class="style7">PL:&nbsp; It was my pleasure.
