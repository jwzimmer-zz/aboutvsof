I&rsquo;ve been involved in UFO research      probably most of my life. I got involved in the actual investigation of      cases starting in 1976 with the Brian Scott case. And that&rsquo;s when      I joined MUFON and became a Field Investigator.<br>      </font><img src="bill_hamilton_med.jpg" alt="Bill Hamilton" width="450" height="392" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So how long were you a Field Investigator for MUFON?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Probably since 19... well, let me see... 25 years off and on... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: How did you interact with aliens?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: ...it was 1957. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And what        I knew about about UFOs I had learned from what I call the California        Contactees back at that time. And there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of      controversy about the contactees, about UFOs or whatever. In fact, I had      started to meet the contactees. And I was only 14 and I had a buddy in      high school... we were freshmen in high school... and I said, &ldquo;I      would like to try an experiment. I would like to try an experiment along      the same lines that George Hunt Williamson did in attempting contact with      these UFOs.&rdquo; Right? &ldquo;Now, I believe they&rsquo;re there but      I want to see if I can contact them.&rdquo; We tried this experiment, and      obviously we did not have the ham radio equipment. We didn&rsquo;t have      anything that we could use except an attempt at psychic contact by using      pencil and paper. And when we initiated this little experiment we started      to hear a sound that was reverberating throughout the room. And so we got      up and we looked all around the apartment. He and I were.... He was a      French-Canadian named Yves [Lauriault]. He and I were together alone in      his parents&rsquo; apartment. And we couldn&rsquo;t locate the source of      the sound, so we decided to go outdoors. When we went outdoors it seemed      like the sound was emanating from the sky above us. So we discontinued      our little experiment, went downstairs and sat on the grass. And as soon      as we did this, the first thing that we saw was a very... well, it looked      to us like it was tiny... a tiny red glowing disc just glides right over      our heads. Soundlessly. One came by. A second one came by. At that moment      in time, unknown to me, Yves continued the experiment. He was sending out      these mental requests for the second object that passed over to turn around      and come back. And what happened is, as soon as he did that, the object      executed a turn, a very, very tight 180 and came right back over our heads. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And so        he told me what he was doing and he said, &ldquo;If we see more,      let&rsquo;s do it together.&rdquo; And we saw two more appear. And they      were all traveling from north to south, and so we sent out a request for      them to turn around and follow each other, right? And they did. I mean,      it was almost instantly. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, all        together that night we saw fourteen objects. After that, Yves&rsquo; father      had to move and took Yves out of school and I didn&rsquo;t see him again.      In fact, I haven&rsquo;t seen him until about, oh, three years ago. He      found me on the internet. And I found out he was right over in Bakersfield,      and he drove over to see me. When we talked I also found out that was the      only UFO experience he ever had and he still remembered every detail. He      was impressed by it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So that was        unknown to me at the time, and I continued the experiment for three years,        only from my house. Right? And so I took my... I was living with my        aunt and my grandmother and I took her outside and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve      got one up there now.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m watching television.&rdquo; And      I said, &ldquo;Well, you told me to tell you when I saw one, that you&rsquo;d      like to see it.&rdquo; So I took her out there and [pointing upward] I      said, &ldquo;There it is.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; And      I said, &ldquo;Yeah. Right now it just looks like a light, bright in the      sky,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but watch this [gesturing upward left, then      right] Turn left. Turn right.&rdquo; She turns white as a sheet and she      said, &ldquo;Oh my God, you&rsquo;re talking to it.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Yeah,      that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been telling you all along.&rdquo; And then      it occurred to me that she was just humoring me until she saw it for herself.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And these        experiments continued, so that... I had a very large object in 1958.        Hovered. It was coming in faster than a jet and stopped on a dime. I        had a friend from across the street over. I had my first telescope. This        thing was as big as a 747 and it just hung in the air. That is what stimulated        me to think, &ldquo;How did it do that? I&rsquo;m going to study the science      of gravity. I&rsquo;m going to find out how it defies gravity. And inertia.&rdquo;...      Right? Two basic qualities of a physical object that&rsquo;s in motion,      right? Because when this thing... It flipped end-over-end and it started      up again... I mean it was just like it had no mass. It just went &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; and      started to climb and at that moment, I mean, my friend was looking through      the telescope. It took that long for him to respond, look up and see it      rise into the clouds.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then I        used to... then I started calling them down, like using them for a &ldquo;Yes/No&rdquo; game. Right? It didn&rsquo;t even occur to me      that there were logistics to this or anything. Right? Just... &ldquo;Oh,      I just met this new person says their a contactee. If this is true, do      you know about it? Can you show me?&rdquo; Right? And sometimes they&rsquo;d      come over, dashing right over my head about 100 yards up. I mean, now they      get lower, right? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ah, then there        was another time when it seemed like I was bathed in some kind of electrical        shower. Right? And then I could... I started getting telepathic answers.        Very short. Right? But one of them just struck me, I think it was around        1959. It was golden. It was a golden disc. Just beautiful. Just hanging        there and it said, &ldquo;Wake up your mind. You&rsquo;re      in a deep sleep.&rdquo; Yeah, and that stayed with me.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another time        we were out in the desert experimenting with a lightbeam transceiver        to communicate with them. And there was about 14 people. The guy you        saw downstairs, Bob Short, was out there and he can remember the incident        because we were using the lightbeam transmitter for line-of-sight transmission        into the sky, saying, &ldquo;If you receive our signal, could      you please respond?&rdquo; Of course, we were hoping for a signal back.      They never responded through the lightbeam transceiver, although some people      have been successful with them. Instead, for some reason, and there were      others who were contactees out there that day, I was the one that heard,      you know, just like they did over my driveway, they repeated this message.      And they said, &ldquo;Look for our bright blue flare in the west.&rdquo; Three      times. And I said, &ldquo;I better tell my buddy John here because if it      happens he&rsquo;s not going to believe me if I tell him after the fact.&rdquo; So      I told him. After I told him exactly what the words were, Bob Short, who&rsquo;s      downstairs, said...&nbsp; Somebody had asked him, &ldquo;Well, what direction      is west?&rdquo; And it was just like synchronized to some kind of... you      know, it&rsquo;s just like theatre with these people. Right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: [laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: He points just like this... and just as he did, a blue bolide came      right down. It looked like barbells, right? Very unusual. Beautiful. And      John wrote about it eventually in his book but he decided to leave my name      out.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: This was John....?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: This was John McCoy from Texas.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So, where... Are you from.... did this happen mainly in Texas?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: This happened in the high desert of California. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Ah. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I&rsquo;m not from Texas... although I&rsquo;ve        spent time in the Air Force there.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My contactee type of experiences... I mean, a saucer never landed and      invited me aboard. I do believe that I had encounters with people here      on Earth that were not from Earth. Very brief encounters. Back then, and      even later on, okay, they always seemed to happen at about the time that      I launched an investigation into something. I wanted to know the answers. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I went to        college, left that contactee era behind me. Dropped out of college due        to economic necessity, joined the Air Force, went into Air Force Security        Service. Had one sighting while I was in the Air Force. Got discharged.        Went into the aerospace industry. I wanted to be an aerospace engineer.        That didn&rsquo;t        happen because the aerospace industry collapsed. I got into computers.        I started... I went to night school, learned programming, became a programmer.        Been one ever since. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You work at UCLA? Is that right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I work at UCLA as a programmer/analyst, senior programmer/analyst.      Just about to retire. I always loved science and engineering, so kind of      regretted not going along that line.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&ldquo;People          on Earth who are not from Earth&rdquo;</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So you        say you&rsquo;ve had interactions with beings that... I&rsquo;m      assuming they look human?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: These people        can move among us. They could be downstairs and mingle and you wouldn&rsquo;t        know it. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Now, it        isn&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t have a few distinguishing      features, they&rsquo;re kind of like &ldquo;heightened&rdquo; features.      They&rsquo;re... in appearance, they&rsquo;re perfect. They would be our      conception of perfect men and women. I mean, they have absolute symmetry      of features. They have flawless skin. They have perfect eyesight, perfect      teeth, perfect form. Everything seems perfect, as if they have mastered      the genetic master plan. One difference is, you might notice if you looked      at them, is their eyes. Some of them have a little different eye coloring      than you would see in a human, or they&rsquo;ll have these little sparkling      silver or golden flakes in their eyes. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Hmm.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: These types        also were extremely strong. A five-foot-three woman could lift a six-foot-four        man right off the ground with the strength of ten men. They could bend        their fingers back. They say we are related to them. We&rsquo;re...        we are the hybrids, not them; they are the pure form of man, right? Hu-Man,        right? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That was the        story we got back in those days. Lots of contacts in the 1960s. I actually        saw two of them driving a car on a highway and they wanted to make contact        with me. They let me know. And it&rsquo;s because there      was another person I knew in Hollywood who had contact with them who told      me about that incident that happened on the highway, that I&rsquo;m fairly      convinced, because she wasn&rsquo;t there, and so how did she know? Right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got interested        in some of the, ah... I started hearing about abductions, right? You        know, Betty Hill abduction and everything. And at first I rejected them.        That wasn&rsquo;t... did not conform to the pattern that I already      knew. And believe me, back in the &lsquo;50s there were a lot of people      that had contact experiences that never got up on a lecture stand, never      wrote a book, were never interviewed on it, but I spoke to them. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And in one particular case, some of these people showed up out at Giant      Rock, four of them, with 36 witnesses, out there. By the time I started      going out there, I could only find two or three witnesses out of those      36.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>[missing dialog for five seconds]</em></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the person        I really felt strong about was George Van Tassel. I became good friends        with George Van Tassel. I had so many conversations with that man, hours        of them. You know, I just admired him. He had this tremendous breadth        of knowledge and he didn&rsquo;t have any real higher formal education.      The other person I knew very well was Daniel Fry, because I was vice president      of this group. And he was a brilliant guy, and he didn&rsquo;t have any      formal education.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Hm. So,        you&rsquo;ve        been sort of one of the main researchers involved with Dan Burisch, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Yes, well,        that&rsquo;s coming way up in time because it was, when      I started to investigate Brian Scott in the 1970s, who was an abductee/      contactee. He was both, right? Ah, I spent four years on that case. That&rsquo;s      how fascinating. And then it was during that period of time I spent four      years that I had two of these guys walk into my house.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Two of what guys?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Whoever they were! </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K &amp; B:        [laughs] </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: But they        came into my house. Well, I ran a rooming house with my wife in Los Angeles        at the time. She&rsquo;s now deceased. But &hellip; they      came through that door. My friend John was in the kitchen. He never heard      the door open. They just walked down the hallway. And they were dressed      in suits and they said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re from the Health Department.      We&rsquo;ve received a complaint. We need to inspect the house.&rdquo; This      guy... one goes upstairs. It was a three-room rooming house, I mean three-story      rooming house. The other one went into what I would call my library room.      I had all these books and I had a section all on UFOs. He goes into this      room and I thought, &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s going to look at the floor,      right? For cockroaches, or mice, or something, right? What&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo; No.      He&rsquo;s looking at my UFO books! So I stood in the doorway so that he      couldn&rsquo;t get out of the room unless he came by me. So he came right      up to me, I looked right into his eyes.... and my brain jammed because      I thought I was looking right into infinity, into... a highly evolved being.      I mean, I can&rsquo;t even begin to tell you the feeling that I had at      that moment. And I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;Who are you? Why don&rsquo;t      you say something to me?&rdquo; Right? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking      when his partner comes down the stairs and says, &ldquo;We have to go now.&rdquo; </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So they exit        the back door and I follow them out and this guy that was in my library,        he turns around at the end of the steps and says, &ldquo;Do      you have a cigarette?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; At that time      I smoked, so I gave him a Benson &amp; Hedges. And then he goes... he      looks at me... he says, &ldquo;Do you have a light for this cigarette?&rdquo; And      I had one of the new Bic lighters and I handed it to him. And he took it,      but he had it upside-down. And he&rsquo;s looking at this thing and he      reaches for me like this [demonstrates holding lighter out], and said, &ldquo;Would-you-please-operate-this-mechanism-for-me?&rdquo; Now,      who talks like that, right? And I said, &ldquo;Oh, OK,&rdquo; like he was      a child. I showed him how it worked and lit his cigarette. And it was like      he wanted to know what it as like, right? He took a draw, threw it away. &ldquo;We      have to go now.&rdquo; So I yelled to my friend John. I said, &ldquo;John,      get out here on the double.&rdquo; So he comes out. These guys headed for      an alleyway, right? And I am only one house over from an intersection of      two streets. I say, &ldquo;John, you take that street, I&rsquo;ll take      this street. I want to know what car they get into.&rdquo; And I mean we      ran to the street just as they disappeared out of sight. When I got back      to... I said, &ldquo;Well, John, I didn&rsquo;t see anything, did you?&rdquo; He      said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see a car pull      away?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, did you see the men walking?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; They      vanished! Right away I went to my wife and I said, &ldquo;Call the Health      Department now. I want to know who they sent down and why.&rdquo; She called.      They&rsquo;d never sent anybody down.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: [laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And what        happened? A few days later, one of these... two more guys show up at        Denny&rsquo;s Restaurant. And I won&rsquo;t go through that      whole scenario except one guy said... as we were listening to what they      were talking about because he was mentioning Brian Scott. And I&rsquo;m      going, &ldquo;How do two strangers know about Brian?&rdquo;... he said      to his partner, &ldquo;The humans are upset.&rdquo; And when I looked into      his blue eyes, the same feeling...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Mmm...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Right?        And I&rsquo;m going, &ldquo;Who are these people?&rdquo; And      they can walk right among us. It&rsquo;s... well... my story is really      not significant. There&rsquo;s no way I could prove these people were something      extremely unusual. Other people have reported these type of encounters.      Even Timothy Good has reported that type of encounter. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Collecting Testimony</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Did you write a book about Brian Scott?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Yeah. Well, I wrote... When I finally got published it was only one      chapter in <em>Alien Magic</em>. I think it was chapter two. It was all      about Brian. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Because        I was, you know... you said... you went to Brian when we talked about        Dan Burisch, and I&rsquo;m curious about that.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Ah, yeah,        because Brian was the first time I had heard about the years 2011 and        2012. When I met Dan Burisch later on, I&rsquo;m hearing about      2012. (I&rsquo;m just trying to rapidly scan through this.) I went from      being interested in that... During that period of time I was interested      in the Brian Scott case I had people coming to me that were former military      people. This is how I got involved in that part. That turned into the &lsquo;80s      and I had investigated, oh, about a dozen abduction cases by then as a      MUFON investigator. And/or sites, right? Whatever there was in my area.      And then, you know, I even gave Field Investigator training classes after      a while, you know, and I started really getting into it because I was good      at [laughs] scientific investigation at least. I had no training as far      as, you know, detective, police type investi... or forensics, right? but      that fits in there too. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: But, see,        I transited over into suddenly people telling me about crash retrievals.        And I got interested in that. Crash retrievals during the mid &lsquo;80s      moved into underground bases and Area 51. I first heard about Area 51 in      1984 and about Lt. Robert Vaughn and how he died when his plane crashed.      Lt.-Commander... I mean Lt.-General Robert Vaughn who was Vice Commander      of the Air Force Systems Command. I&rsquo;m going, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully      unusual for him to be test flying some aircraft, right? Why would a Vice      Commander go out there and risk his life?&rdquo; They use lieutenants,      captains, and majors for doing test flights. I was in the Air Force then,      by the way. I was in Air Force Security Service. I had a Top Secret Crypto      clearance. So I was also familiar with... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So let&rsquo;s hear a little about that. Did you... at the time you      were in the Air Force you were not privy to, I&rsquo;m assuming, the UFO     ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: No. No, no, no.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But you always had this history behind you. Do you think that,      or was, the Air Force aware of that history?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Yes. Well,        I needed to have a Top Secret clearance. The FBI took six months to give        me that clearance. They talked to some of my friends who knew me out        at Giant Rock... spacecraft conventions! I thought, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s      it. They&rsquo;ll never give me a clearance.&rdquo; </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: [laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Right? No. No. They all... these friends gave me a glowing report,      so they took me. I got my clearance.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow. So OK. So as far as Dan Burisch is concerned....</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Yeah, he came along much later. I mean, I went through about... I      had collected testimony by that time that Steven Greer...you know who      he is... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Yeah.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: ... got        involved in his project of witnesses. He got his first witnesses from        me. At that time I had no project in mind, like he did, you know, going        to Congress? All I was doing was trying to collect the testimony. I was        trying to keep confidential some of these peoples&rsquo; names because      they requested it and I knew they would just shut me off if I started yapping      all over the place. But I was trying to find out what was going on. I had      teamed up with Bill Steinman at the time. Bill Steinman lead me to John      Lear. John Lear led me to investigate Dulce, New Mexico. I went over there,      drove all around that place with Gabe Valdez back in the &lsquo;80s. I      got hooked up with my friend Tal who was an insider/outsider, you know,      one foot in, one foot out... kept giving me tips and information and what      have you, to track down.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I got very        involved. I met a guy in the &lsquo;90s that was in reverse      engineering, that had flown one of our reverse engineered craft to the      moon and back. I mean, it was getting deeper and deeper, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Bob Lazar</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Did you ever meet Bob Lazar?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Yep. I knew about Bob Lazar before anybody else did, through John Lear.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Oh, of course. Of course.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: John Lear        called me up one day: &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve got a story      to tell you, Bill.&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotta      go for a ride.&rdquo; (He was a little paranoid.) &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get      in my truck.&rdquo; And he told me all about Bob Lazar except his name,      at the time, because, you know, I guess... But he told me things about      Bob, that Bob had told him, that Bob never mentioned. And, what... you      know, John believes is that they tinkered with his memory, right? Because      he had heard all this stuff about the moon from Bob Lazar and stuff like      that. Bob is, &ldquo;No way, no way.&rdquo; But one day...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. Wait       ... that&rsquo;s a little unclear. You&rsquo;re saying they      tinkered with Bob Lazar&rsquo;s memory?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Yes, with his memory.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Not John        Lear&rsquo;s.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: No, not        John Lear&rsquo;s.        In others words, Bob had... according to John, Bob had related all of        this information to John which later Bob denied that he had... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Yes, in a certain sense there was a disconnect. He kind of, like, forgot     ....</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Right. There was a disconnect.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ... that he ever knew that. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Right.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So        there&rsquo;s... yes... there&rsquo;s        some question as far as that goes. So, OK, so on the trail to Dan Burisch       ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Bill Uhouse / J-Rod</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Then I met Bill Uhouse.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: That&rsquo;s an important event. Bill Uhouse was a mechanical engineer      who, speaking out at Rachel and people that &ldquo;you ought to meet Uhouse,&rdquo; &lsquo;cause      by that time I had been speaking about some of these disclosure people      we&rsquo;re talking about. So I met Bill Uhouse and I thought it was hilarious.      Here he had been working on a flight simulator for flying discs so our      pilots could learn how to fly them and one of the &ldquo;chief consultants&rdquo; on      this top secret project was an alien that he called J-Rod! Right? And that&rsquo;s      where I first heard about J-Rod. In 1999 I&rsquo;m on the internet and      I find there is a website I stumbled across when I, you know, typed in      a search or something and here was this document, and I said, &ldquo;Boy,      this document&rsquo;s awfully technical. I&rsquo;ve never seen a document      that was technical like this.&rdquo; We call it the Q94 document. And I&rsquo;m      reading through it, and I stopped when I got there and I saw: &ldquo;Extraterrestrial      Biological Entity: AQ-J-Rod.&rdquo; J-Rod. You know &hellip; whoa! Wait      a minute! And it was signed Captain Danny B. Crain, Ph.D.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dan Burisch / MJ-12 / Getting the truth out</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I got ahold        of the person and I ordered a copy of this, flashed it around MUFON and        said, &ldquo;Hey, is anybody interested in this?&rdquo; I      couldn&rsquo;t rouse any interest. [laughs] And I&rsquo;m, like, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; And      I couldn&rsquo;t get any more information until 2002 when this person,      Marci, contacted me and she said, &ldquo;You know, Bill, I need help. I      need help. Dan&rsquo;s in trouble...&rdquo; dadada. And at that point      I had not met Dan, I had not met Marci, and she just called me at work      at UCLA and I said, &ldquo;We have to sit down and talk.&rdquo;</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I think        it was on a Friday. It was before... I was going to leave, go up to        Vegas on that Saturday, and she called me in the afternoon just before        I left and said, &ldquo;Bill, how would you like to meet Dan?&rdquo; And      I said, &ldquo;Are you kidding? Can you arrange that?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;Yes      I can.&rdquo; So when I went there I not only met Marci for the first time,      I met Dan. And when he first saw me... and I was wearing an Air Force cap...      he took all these papers and his briefcase and he stuffed all the papers      in the briefcase and he ran out of that room, &lsquo;cause he didn&rsquo;t      know who I was. And I said, &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; you know. And Marci said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll      handle it,&rdquo; and went over to the elevator. Called me back in about      five minutes later, and introduced me to Dan. And he was, like, shaking.      I mean, I&rsquo;m serious. And he said, &ldquo;You know I have to....&quot; he      said, &quot;I&rsquo;m very sorry I reacted like that. I have to watch myself.      I&rsquo;ve only got, you know, two hours of liberty.&rdquo; Right? And      Marci says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a private room,&rdquo; you know, the      library where we were. And so we went in there. I had one hour with him.      He was very nervous. He had a cold or something that first time, but some      of the answers he gave me that first time knocked my socks off. I said      this guy has met an alien, because there were certain things that he knew      that were so typical that I had picked up along the way from Brian, from      everyone, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And you certainly had a background at that point to be able to evaluate      somebody like that...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Oh yeah, after 25 years...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Who was        Marci? Who is Marci, would you say? She&rsquo;s an agent?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: No, she        was just... she was working for the State of Nevada, OK? She had a job        in human resources because she&rsquo;s got a masters degree in,      ah... what do they call it... organizational psychology, which they hire      the psych people in human resources. She was working with computers. She&rsquo;s      very good at that. She&rsquo;s worked in casinos. She did casino surveillance,      you know, with those cameras?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: She even wrote a book about... yeah. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: How did she get involved with Dan, then?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: She met        him... well, that&rsquo;s a good question, because the first      story that came to me is Dan&rsquo;s mother was working at that same casino.      Dan was working at that casino. Security. And she had observed him on camera      a couple times doing some unusual things, like going into this office,      punching in a code, hanging up the telephone, the telephone ringing and      she could hear him saying, &ldquo;Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir.&rdquo; Things      like this. So Dan approached her because she had some writing experience      and said, &ldquo;I want to get out a story. It&rsquo;s about research I&rsquo;ve      done on the planet Mars as a biome.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;Ah, really?&rdquo; So      she got involved, and as things progressed she found out... or she was      warn... She got warnings: &ldquo;Watch out, this man is involved with      Area 51.&rdquo; &ldquo;Area 51? Not that story.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s      just a popular legend here in Las Vegas.&rdquo; And oh, no, this was for      real and so people were starting to give her documents. In fact I got a      copy of one of them which I published in my book, which is a security oath      that he signed up at the Tonopah test site back in the &lsquo;80s. So...      now, ostensibly they wrote the book. There were a couple of other men involved      in that, and Dan, and her. It was called Eagles Disobey. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You can&rsquo;t get that book now, isn&rsquo;t        that right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: There are        copies of it but... she had assigned the rights to somebody and that        somebody did not assign the rights back to her when she requested it.        The thing is, the only thing is, one day I get an e-mail from Marci,        now 2002, 3, 4... time passes on. At one point there she thinks Dan        has been captured or died or hurt or something. She doesn&rsquo;t know. She&rsquo;s      scared. Some of her contacts that she had told her, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d      be safer to get out of town.&rdquo; So... she came from Canada... so      she went back to Canada. She contacted me when she was in Canada. And she      started saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being followed. People are following me      everywhere and I&rsquo;m worried, and something&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; And      then I get... well, see, I got mysterious letters also in the mail, when      it all started.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: From....?        I mean, are they... well, let&rsquo;s say, they are from      the community, so to speak?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: From the black community.

[laughs].      In other words, there was planted cameras all over the place. And then      finally sent me a picture of her with a Majestic badge... MAJ. OK? It usually      has a letter and four numbers, just like Bob Lazar&rsquo;s, only instead      of 'H', like, Dan had an 'E'.

Not only that, there were... See, there&rsquo;s      all kinds... this is what&rsquo;s so mysterious. Somebody starts sending      us background material. Everything I could check out absolutely checked      out. I&rsquo;ve had conversations recorded, e-mail intercepted. I was walking      with my friend Winston outdoors. We were talking. That conversation was      picked up by a spy device. Outdoors. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Right.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And regurgitated back to me in an e-mail.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Ah.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: There were        some errors, which was interesting. I have met Dan and had photographs,        taken from unknown people standing somewhere behind me in a casino, sent        to me by e-mail, to the point where I started saying, &ldquo;Hey.      Boy, this is either an elaborate hoax involving many people or it&rsquo;s      the real thing.&rdquo; Right? &ldquo;This is a covert operation of some      kind.&rdquo; Because they have sophisticated enough technology that they      could tap into our conversations indoors or outdoors. They can intercept      my e-mail. They intercepted an e-mail from my friend Alan to me. That was      just from him to me. It had some confidential information that they...      and they wished to let us know that they knew. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Right.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: So that was the kind of thing that became more and more convincing      all along.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. Now.        I&rsquo;ve        heard that you were invited to join Majestic. Is that a rumor, or is        that true?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Ah, let        me say this. I knocked on the door. I started thinking. &ldquo;Dan,      you know they sent you to school. I never completed my education in physics      or engineering... Maybe they&rsquo;ll send me.&rdquo; You know? And I      said, &ldquo;Could you get me in?&rdquo; You know? &ldquo;You think they&rsquo;ll      take me up to S-4 or... anything?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Lazar talked his      way into it, maybe I can talk my way into it.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have      the opportunity here.&rdquo; </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And so        at some point, I think it was in 2004, in March 2004, Dan requested that        I research something in physics, or... actually pertaining to biophysics.        It was something he was looking into. And he said, &ldquo;You know...      send me a paper on it.&rdquo; So I did... two... on biophotonics. He      said, &ldquo;This is great.&rdquo; And... and that&rsquo;s something. He      folded my papers up with all of his and went off to Washington, DC, and      delivered them. And I went... &ldquo;Did I just contribute something to      your project?&rdquo; [laughs] And he said, &ldquo;Yep. It&rsquo;s a matter      of record now.&rdquo; Right? And he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s      good stuff.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m going, &ldquo;Well, great.&rdquo; And      I said, &ldquo;Wait a minute. If I&rsquo;m going to do that, I want...      I want the door to open.&rdquo; Well, then I get contacted by his security: &ldquo;OK.      You were in the Air Force. You took an oath.&rdquo; And dadadada.... right? &ldquo;For      now we want you to reply to this e-mail that you will abide by the oath      you took then.&rdquo; You know, Top Secret oath, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: So I&rsquo;m going, &ldquo;How can he do that?&rdquo; Right? Then I&rsquo;m      sent a message from Majestic-1 to William Hamilton saying, &ldquo;You have      asked certain questions about Dan and we have agreed (because they always      have to agree) to provide you an answer.&rdquo; And he starts going through      a timeline, right? Starting at Eisenhower&rsquo;s meeting with the aliens,      right? 1958 first treaty signed near Los Alamos. And coincidentally my      friend Robert sends me a photograph of a Majestic team, 1958, right outside      of Los Alamos. So I&rsquo;m going, &ldquo;Whoa, what&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; This      is getting stronger and stronger, right? I have published that full message...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Yes, and why do you think they are doing this?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I am being        told that Dan was... you know, first they selected Bob Lazar and they        said, &ldquo;We wanted to see what he would do.&rdquo; But      he became a maverick, right? A little uncontrollable. They had better control      of Dan. They felt Dan was very bright because he almost has... well, he      had an eidetic memory. OK. And they just decided, for reasons that weren&rsquo;t      immediately apparent to me at that time, a little bit more apparent to      me now... because it turns out that Dan was abducted when he was a child,      that he should tell the world, but he should tell the world in a positive      voice... right?... what is going on. And Majestic has, according to what      I&rsquo;ve found out... again, I&rsquo;m only reporting this. I have no      way of verifying some of these things. But now I do know who all the current      numbers are. Right? They have met for the last time last year [2005] in      assembly and have agreed not to meet, convene, again for two years. And      when they convened they voted on giving Dan an order to tell the world.      And he has until the end of this year [2006] to accomplish that mission      because they expect more and more radical changes which will become apparent      to the public as we proceed to 2007, 2008, toward this omega point of 2012 &hellip;</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: &hellip; which        they expect us to survive.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So basically        in a certain sense, you know, if I&rsquo;m following you,      you were denied access to joining MJ-12?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Yeah, it        was like I came along a little too late to really contribute anything.        I mean, they agreed that I could start working with Dan if I wanted to,        if I took a project. He still wants me to work on some of the science        with him. It&rsquo;s just that I have been recruited to work on      another project, for which I have to sign a non-disclosure agreement, by      another person who has kind of.... taken and proven that we have been      reverse engineering craft and wants me to be involved in that. So, because      I want to know what&rsquo;s going on everywhere, what do I do? I volunteer      for these things. So I have had a foot... it feels like I&rsquo;ve had      a foot almost in the door but not to the point of where I wanted to be     ... where I said, &ldquo;Hey, show me the money. Show me... not the money     .... show me the proof that you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So... OK.... but Dan...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I&rsquo;m        in a very...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Dan is alive, is alive and doing well at the moment. Is that correct?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Yes, I only saw him a few weeks ago.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.

You know....</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Dan is sane. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK, that&rsquo;s        what I want to hear, is what your take is.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Rational. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: OK?

Are you releasing that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I&rsquo;m not releasing anything any more, because I don&rsquo;t        have the rights.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Meaning... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: As far as...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Majestic-12 has the rights? Dan has the rights?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: No. Ron        Garner. He&rsquo;s here. If you want to interview him, he&rsquo;s      here at this conference. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Ron Garner.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Yep.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Was he involved in the shooting of it? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: He went in there with money.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Did he        shoot it? I mean, I&rsquo;m just trying to figure out how he      has rights. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: No. Well,        he says that he has all the right connections to get Dan&rsquo;s      story out, to television, you know, all over, and apparently he has offered      Dan and Marci enough evidence that he has these connections. But I don&rsquo;t      like it. I told Dan I will not work with Ron Garner. OK? You know, I published      a book on Dan. I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end of the story.&rdquo; I      told the story. I said right in the introduction: &ldquo;I cannot prove      this story to the public.&rdquo; But I know that I have seen enough and      experienced enough. Because I have been closer, I believe, than any investigator      to Dan, and there are things that, to me, speak the truth. OK? I mean,      I&rsquo;ve seen Dan use disinformation because he was ordered to. He doesn&rsquo;t      like to but he was ordered to for security reasons and I know how they      use him. Now the Intel guys that specialize in disinformation? Sometimes      they do it just for fun, get a kick out of spinning us around. And that&rsquo;s      what I believe they&rsquo;ve done with Project Serpo, because it&rsquo;s      just so full of... errors. I&rsquo;ll put it that way, mildly.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Project Serpo</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Well, OK.        Well, that&rsquo;s interesting that you happen to think...      And you know, I&rsquo;m going to end this pretty soon here and you&rsquo;ve      been very gracious and, and this is great. But I was just wondering, in      terms of Project Serpo... I know you&rsquo;ve pointed out some very, you      know, accurate errors, that have been, you know, recognized, at least by      Bill Ryan, and acknowledged. But do you think there&rsquo;s any truth to      the story?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I think        we have an exchange program. See, I&rsquo;ve been hearing this      story on and off for a number of years and... I was supposed to meet a      colonel from Edwards Air Force Base... I used to hold meetings out in      the Antelope Valley and one of my people that came to the meetings met      this colonel who looked at my book, even read through it, and said, &ldquo;Hey      this here&rsquo;s about 80 to 90 percent accurate.&rdquo; Then he started      telling her, &ldquo;How would you like to see some real documents on this?&rdquo; And      she goes, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, not if they&rsquo;re classified.&rdquo; And      he said, &ldquo;I want to show you all the different levels of identification      I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo; Right? And then he started telling a story. He says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m      going to tell you this story because, you know, nobody&rsquo;s going to      believe this anyway.&rdquo; And he said that he has been on another planet      where he could see two suns in the sky. And also he said, &ldquo;I had      a brigadier general that was a good friend of mine.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I      was flying a jet out of Edwards and I crash landed. And there were a lot      of injuries. I didn&rsquo;t think I would survive that. And they took me      to the underground hospital at Edwards... underground facility hospital     ... and they used some of the alien technology to put me back together.&rdquo; </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Hm.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: So, you know... stories like this guy saying that he had actually      been to another world, ah, was fascinating. And I had heard stories like      that. Nothing you could prove, right? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Sure.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: But it        seems like somebody gathered these together... changed the whole character        of the Ebens, right? And put together this story somewhat like the Steven        Spielberg Close Encounters where they had twelve people, I think two        of them women, ten men, that were supposed to go aboard this craft. And        I mean they just weaved it all together, but they didn&rsquo;t pay      very much attention to science.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Hmm.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: So what        they described is a planet around Zeta Reticuli with two stars that are        only about as distant from the planet as our own sun is. OK? That&rsquo;s      impossible. A planet cannot... you know, which sun does the planet orbit?      And there is no such close, 180 million mile distance between two stars      in Zeta Reticuli. The two stars, Zeta Reticuli 1 and Zeta Reticuli 2 are      over a light year apart, about 9,000 astronomical units, compared to ONE      astronomical unit. OK? So that&rsquo;s one big error. And then they make      the planet almost the exact same diameter as the Earth and give it a different      gravitational constant, right? Then they say, ah, they didn&rsquo;t have      any means of tracking the time on the planet... on the planet Serpo? But      they did have this tower, which was something like a sundial, right? And      they knew what time it was. And I said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have advanced      technology,&rdquo; (you know, I protested) &ldquo;... without extremely      precise clocks and timing mechanisms. You can&rsquo;t even have a computer      without that, much less a space craft that travels light years.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,      who&rsquo;s the idiot who asked this question?&rdquo; Right? I am. I mean,      I know technology, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>New          Interests / Is &ldquo;reality&rdquo; real?</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So are you basically interested in writing any more books?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I have branched out a little further away from just... because I got      interested in certain subjects, as a consequence of some of this research,      that fascinate me about the universe, about reality... well... is reality      real?
