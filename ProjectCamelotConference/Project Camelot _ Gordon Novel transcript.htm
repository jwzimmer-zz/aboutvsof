They recognized in the mid &lsquo;50s      they probably had rigs at Dugway etc, that was beginning to go up and down      from the thing and they began to recognize the paradox. The paradoxes are:      Tell me how you&rsquo;re going to run the economy.

They&rsquo;re known but, there&rsquo;s no...      I don&rsquo;t need the ego-trip of that association.<br>      <br>      K: OK. And right now you actually have a project that you&rsquo;re coming      to Hollywood to, ah... a movie. That&rsquo;s OK to say, right?<br>      <br>      G: Yeah. Yeah. Yep. We&rsquo;re doing a trilogy... a project on a trilogy      of films called <em>Kingdoms Come</em> with my co-producer Doug      Ivanovitch and we&rsquo;re currently in the process of funding the project      in the hundreds of millions of dollar level.<br>      <br>      K: OK. And is it correct that the CIA is actually backing your other project?      Is that something you want to say?<br>      <br>      G: Well, they... they&rsquo;re interested in supporting and endorsing      a number of things that I&rsquo;m doing because they are capable of changing      things like global warming and getting rid of global warming, and getting      rid of the chaotic conditions of our current New World Order and that kind      of thing. Getting rid of the murder and mayhem that goes on on the planet.<br>      <br>      K: OK. And this is, now, would you say, the good side of the CIA? There      is more...<br>      <br>      G: Definitely.<br>      <br>      K: ...than one side of the CIA, is there not?<br>      <br>      G: The CIA has multiple sides but it&rsquo;s been my experience over the      years that they&rsquo;re basically the only good guys in the entire United      States government. They&rsquo;re really patriots. Most of &lsquo;em are      patriots and I&rsquo;ve never known... I personally have never known them      to do anything criminal, ever. And they didn&rsquo;t kill John Kennedy      and they didn&rsquo;t kill a lot of people that they&rsquo;ve been accused      of causing the death of but I don&rsquo;t know that to be true. So I can      tell you that my experience with &lsquo;em has been like dealing with Eagle      Scouts.<br>      <br>      K: OK. How long have you been dealing with them?<br>      <br>    G: Since about age 20.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On the death of the Kennedys</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Did you have anything to do with the death of Robert Kennedy or Jack      Kennedy? <br><br>      G: No, absolutely not. All that...<br><br>      K: Now why do people think that you did?<br><br>      G: Because I was... first became... I was working at the White House and      then on a counter-intelligence project that was kind of important. And     ... I got referenced over to Garrison and he made me his chief of security.      And I discovered that he was fabricating evidence. And he found out that      I&rsquo;d discovered that and he turned it over to NBC. So he decided that      the best way was to make me his most important material witness. And he      wasn&rsquo;t accusing me of a crime, but it cost me a lot of grief and      a lot of people thought I was involved, which I wasn&rsquo;t. Never was      involved in that. I have...<br><br>      K: OK. And...<br><br>      G: ...one of the best alibis in the world. [chuckles]<br><br>      K: And you actually... You have a lot of feeling, or sympatico, isn&rsquo;t      that true, with what Kennedy stood for?<br><br>      G: Yeah. I was in favor of his revelations that were apparently about to      happen having to do with extraterrestrial technologies. And I think that      they kept him in the dark on a lot of stuff and it was one of the reasons      that motivated him to want to go to the moon. So I was very pro John F.      Kennedy.<br><br>      K: OK. And...<br><br>      G: Very pro.<br><br>      K: Very pro. <br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: Uh huh. And what about Robert Kennedy?<br><br>      G: I was personally affiliated with the Attorney General during the Garrison      thing and afterwards, uh, when he ran for President. And my only feeling      about him is that he probably helped precipitate a lot of the problems      that caused the assassination of his brother...<br><br>      K: OK. So...<br><br>      G: ...by chasing the Mafia, for example. <br><br>      K: Uh huh?<br><br>      G: The Mafia supported his brother&rsquo;s election, substantively, and      they got very angry at him, along with folks like the ex-Gehlen Org....      Gehlen Organization of the Nazis and other people like that, that were      out to... and Majestic, I might add...<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: ...were really all out to get him and didn&rsquo;t want him to, to      do...<br><br>      K: So Majestic was around back then.<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      <strong>Robert Kennedy was assassinated by a Manchurian candidate...</strong><br><br>      K: And did they have something to do with the death of Robert Kennedy?<br><br>      G: I don&rsquo;t think that they had anything to do with the death of Robert      Kennedy. Robert Kennedy was murdered by assassination. It was a Manchurian      candidate type of thing and I don&rsquo;t know who engineered it. But I&rsquo;ve      never, ever, known an individual at the CIA to ever indicate to me that      they were part of any plot. And I&rsquo;ve known a lot of &lsquo;em, including      directors.<br><br>      K: And what about John Kennedy? Was that a Manchurian candidate as well?<br><br>      <strong>John Kennedy&rsquo;s assassin was a &ldquo;patsy&rdquo;...</strong><br><br>      G: Uh... Nah, I think it was just a patsy. Oswald was picked for his role      in maybe one of a dozen plots that were being hatched off at the time and      he just happened to be in the right place at the right time to get the     ... to pin the tail on the donkey.<br><br>      K: OK. So how many shots were fired? [smiles]<br><br>      G: Well, I mean, you can... as near as I can hear there were, like, three      or four. So, you know, I don&rsquo;t believe that he did it, that anybody      could have done that the way they claim he did it. And I couldn&rsquo;t      do it and I don&rsquo;t know anybody that could do it. And so I don&rsquo;t      believe it. I don&rsquo;t believe the Mannlicher-Carcano did the deed.      It may have well been used in the deed, but did it actually cause the death?      I&rsquo;m not sure what did it. It could have been frangible bullets coming      from somewhere else up on the grassy knoll.<br><br>      K: Uh huh. And did you think that, I guess, Lyndon Johnson, or anyone else,      had a hand in it?<br><br>      G: If they did, they certainly kept it away from me &lsquo;cause I was      working with the Chief of Staff at the White House at the time. When the      Garrison thing came down I was working with the Chief of Staff and I never      knew any involvement by the Chief of Staff or Mr. Johnson, and I was very      friendly with both of &lsquo;em.<br><br>      K: Uh huh.<br><br>      G: The answer is, I don&rsquo;t think that... I think they were... that      they were just down the pecking order of power that runs the world and      they just happened to be conveniently in the places where they were at      the time.<br><br>      K: OK. So, well, as far as Majestic, or the Illuminati, or the Bilderbergs      or the Rockefellers...<br><br>      G: The Gehlen Org. The Gehlen Org.<br><br>      K: The &quot;Gehlen...&quot;<br>      <br>      G: Org.<br><br>      K: Org.<br><br>      <strong>The Illuminati and the Gehlen Org</strong><br>      <br>      G: Yeah... there was a German SS officer by the name of Gehlen who had      a continuing organization that continued on past World War Two that was      substantively involved in lots of nasty stuff. And still is today.<br><br>      K: OK. And are they set up in this country?<br><br>      G: They&rsquo;re set up all over the world but they mostly answer, if not      to the Illuminati... that&rsquo;s the only place I know that they answer      to anybody. Most people all answer to the Illuminati if there&rsquo;s any      power in any country.<br><br>      K: What about Majestic? Do they get along with the Illuminati?<br><br>      G: According to my information, Majestic and the Illuminati are not seeing      eye to eye over the idea of triaging the population of the planet in order      to bring the population down to a workable level where it&rsquo;s safe      to have life. We&rsquo;re approaching a very high number, around seven      billion people, and they would like to triage a bunch of the population.      And Majestic, which is mostly US military people and some other foreigners,      don&rsquo;t want to see that. They&rsquo;re not in favor of mass assassination      by AIDS, viruses, and stuff like that.<br><br>      K: So this is a good side to the Majestic 12.<br><br>      G: It&rsquo;s the only good side I know of.<br><br>      K: OK. [laugh] Because I know you&rsquo;re not real friendly with them. <br><br>      G: I am friendly with a couple of the members of it, but I&rsquo;m not      friendly with their program to destabilize some of my businesses.<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: They were very nasty last year and we almost ended up whacking each      other and it didn&rsquo;t happen because of a CIA safe house agreement      that protected me and saved my life, actually. So I&rsquo;m very, very,      very indebted to the CIA.<br><br>      K: So, what can you tell us about why you don&rsquo;t get along with Majestic?      Like, what is it that puts you guys at odds?<br><br>      G: Well... <br><br>      K: Or even, maybe this&rsquo;ll tell us why the CIA doesn&rsquo;t get along      with Majestic.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Majestic and the CIA</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G: We sort        of expropriated their technologies from the aliens and we&rsquo;re      not giving it back and we&rsquo;re just...<br><br>      K: You personally...<br><br>      G: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got very lucky back about 17, 18 years ago and      we got our hands on the technology, and worked to reverse engineer it and      pretty much figured it out. At which point we began to figure out everything      that they were doing. So they don&rsquo;t like the fact that I have that      and I have put up a protective wall that they can&rsquo;t beat. So. They     ... killing me is just gonna cause it to go all over the web. So the CD-ROMs      are all packaged real well against that eventuality. They better hope I      never have a heart attack.<br><br>      K: OK. So you set that up so you&rsquo;re protected.<br><br>      G: Yeah. I have a lot of friends in foreign countries who have copies of      the CD-ROM which is basically a green mail, one-on-one type of document      that says: &ldquo;As long as you leave me alone I&rsquo;ll leave you alone.      You fool with me, I&rsquo;ll eat your lunch.&rdquo;<br><br>      K: So tell me a little bit about how you came across... I mean, you&rsquo;re      really a big-picture thinker. And how did you actually start thinking along      these lines?<br><br>      G: I started off as an aeronautical engineer when I was in college and      I got real interested in what makes UFOs go and so I just kind of pursued      the trail of the technology as opposed to the aliens and that kind of stuff.      And that&rsquo;s all I do is pursue the technology. I got lucky. I got      very very lucky and I got my hands on a cutaway of their birds and then      used the cutaway... the engineering cutaways, to reverse engineer the      technology.<br><br>      K: But you&rsquo;re not basing your theories on, say, Tesla or... or Otis      Carr&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t that right?<br><br>      G: No. No, we base it on what we can see is functional and works, we know      is real. We&rsquo;ve got about 12,000 frames of film of the bird dancing      around the skies of Area 51.<br><br>      K: So, this is an ARV... isn&rsquo;t that what it&rsquo;s called?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>RAM: Replication Alien Machine</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G: Uh. That&rsquo;s        what some people call it. We call it RAM, Replication Alien Machine.<br><br>      K: Oh, I see.<br><br>      G: We don&rsquo;t... they call it Alien Reproduction Vehicle, and we don&rsquo;t      do that. We are into the universality of the circuit design that they use      to negate gravity, inertia, and time.<br><br>      K: OK. So you know something about time travel as well.<br><br>      G: Yeah. A UFO is probably very much like the cars back in &ldquo;Back      to the Future,&rdquo; a flying time machine. <br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: They&rsquo;re capable of going backwards and forwards in time.<br><br>      K: And what&rsquo;s your vision for the world? Could you tell us in general      terms?<br><br>      G: Our vision is to get the energy out there so that we can eliminate oil,      coal, and gas and nuclear fuels from polluting the atmosphere and causing      the carbon dioxide that&rsquo;s creating the global warming. That and a      concomitant reduction in the cost of living by about... eighty percent      of the cost of living is attributed to paying for energy. So if you don&rsquo;t      have to pay it out you get to keep it.<br><br>      K: OK. But aren&rsquo;t you worried about the economy? You&rsquo;re actually      trying to safeguard certain aspects of the economy in the process?<br><br>      G: Yeah. There&rsquo;s the... we are interested in, ah, the Plutopian      enhancement of the economy from about 44 trillion GDP currently to about      a quadrillion a year in about ten years, and making everybody about 100      times more wealthy and spreading the wealth out and causing an equalization.      And people don&rsquo;t have to work if they don&rsquo;t have to pay for      energy.<br><br>      K: OK, so... but you&rsquo;re also... you&rsquo;re worried about the      bankers? Isn&rsquo;t that what you told me?<br><br>      G: Yeah, we&rsquo;re definitely worried about the paradoxes that are associated      with time travel in terms of its interference, and how you&rsquo;d run      an economy and how you&rsquo;d have government if you knew what the future&rsquo;s      gonna be. How do you have interest? How do you have stocks? How do you      have bonds? How do you have banks? How do you have taxes? How do you have      government? &lsquo;Cause that&rsquo;s all...<br><br>      K: OK. Why just because you&rsquo;re going to build a vehicle are you going      to know the future? <br><br>      G: The vehicle creates those problems that you must resolve before you      can introduce the technology. You&rsquo;ve got to know what the resolution      of those paradoxes are. We call &lsquo;em, ah... they create mindsets      that are very dramatic in terms of how peoples&rsquo; brains function.<br><br>      K: Is that because when you get in a vehicle you&rsquo;re actually time      traveling?<br><br>      G: Well, to negate gravity, you&rsquo;ve gotta negate time and so time      is the power of the... of the bird and that&rsquo;s where the power...      We don&rsquo;t believe it comes from space or zero point. We believe it      comes from time, purely and simply, and that energy and time are the same      thing.<br><br>      K: And isn&rsquo;t Bill Hamilton working with you at this time?<br><br>      G: Oh, yeah. <br>      <br>      K: Uh huh.<br><br>      G: He&rsquo;s one of my science team.<br><br>      K: Because he&rsquo;s written a book on time travel, I know.<br><br>      G: Yeah, yeah. It&rsquo;s quite accurate, I might add.<br><br>      K: Oh, very good. That&rsquo;s nice to hear. And what about Ramsey Clark?      What&rsquo;s your relationship with Ramsey?<br><br>      G: Ramsey and I have been friends since I was in my early 20s working at      the White House in counter intelligence measures, electronic countermeasures      for the Johnson administration. I&rsquo;ve subsequently been associated      with the Republicans, with President Johnson, I mean President Nixon and      President Reagan.<br><br>      K: OK. Now, didn&rsquo;t you call yourself a libertarian anarchist? Is      that right?<br><br>      G: Yeah. I&rsquo;ve gone from being originally a Democrat to a Republican      to a Libertarian to a Libertarian Anarchist. I&rsquo;m in favor of massive      change. I&rsquo;m in favor of the... what I call the extraterrestrial      revolution which gets rid of the need for government and all of the crap      that goes with it, these decision makers that basically screw with our      lives every day.<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: And I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re necessary. If we know the future      we don&rsquo;t need people to make decisions for us. The decision&rsquo;s      already made.<br><br>      K: OK. Why aren&rsquo;t you working with Bob Bigelow, for example?<br><br>      G: &lsquo;Cause Mr. Bigelow is worried, apparently, about his funding from      the Senate and the Congress for his inflatable habs that he&rsquo;s putting      up in the Shuttle and some of his satellite work. And if he does work on      alien technology, then he won&rsquo;t get funded. He&rsquo;d be... They      don&rsquo;t wanta fund you if... The government can&rsquo;t fund you if      you&rsquo;re trying to...<br><br>      K: Is that because Majestic holds the rights over the alien technology?<br><br>      G: No. Th... we own the intellectual property these days and we tell them      that so I guess they probably figured out that we&rsquo;d figured out how      to get a grip on the intellectual property, but they don&rsquo;t want it      out for many many reasons. I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about destabilizing      oil, coal, gas, nuclear and the banks that are associated with the cash      flow, which is huge. It&rsquo;s 80 percent of the economy for the energy.      And that money all flows through banks and if the banks don&rsquo;t get      it, what do they get? They lose about 80 percent of their cash flow.<br><br>      K: So. Is the idea that they&rsquo;re letting... say, the CIA is working      with you on this now because it&rsquo;s basically coming to an end game?      Is that what&rsquo;s...<br><br>      G: Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s... There&rsquo;s an evolution toward the revelation      of what the technology is to the world, and... In my opinion the CIA is      probably gonna be the only agency that survives the revolution. I haven&rsquo;t      known one that wasn&rsquo;t a patriot, one that... I mean patriots that      walk into bullets. They&rsquo;re very brave...<br><br>      K: OK but are you talking about patriots in the sense that the United States      is gonna run the world?<br><br>      G: Patriots in the sense that the United States is gonna evolve along with      the rest of the nations of the world into some type of new, what we call      New Earth Order, a better system of, ah, of how things work which is not      necessarily a world government but probably is more like a system where      the future is known. God writes the scripts before, time passes, and he      knows... In most of your religions they claim that God knows the past,      the present and the future. Well if he knows the future it&rsquo;s because      he wrote the script. If you can see the script, then all you can do is      live the script. So that&rsquo;s what we believe happens, that the forward      time scanning capabilities of the technology allow governments to not have      to be governments, because there&rsquo;s no need for decisions by bureaucrats.      You don&rsquo;t need &lsquo;em to tell you how to live. It&rsquo;s all      written out how it&rsquo;s gonna be. All aliens, or extraterrestrials...      I don&rsquo;t like to use the word alien... extraterrestrial civilizations      probably all go through the exact same revolution. Oil seems to be a part      of the evolution of planets to get their energy and then the oil is no      longer needed because it creates problems like the global warming problems      that we have today.<br><br>      K: So are you building a craft to go to Mars?<br><br>      G: Uh... We&rsquo;re building power generators and technology to build      starships. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s... that&rsquo;s our objective.<br><br>      K: OK. To go to the edge of the solar system?<br><br>      G: To go to the edge of the universe. We&rsquo;re not interested in the      solar system. The solar system... there&rsquo;s nothing out there of any      consequence.<br><br>      K: OK. And have you met any aliens?<br><br>      G: No. No, I know people who claim they constantly communicate with &lsquo;em      though and are in touch with &lsquo;em, but, no, I haven&rsquo;t had the      pleasure or displeasure.<br><br>      K: Have you ever talked... have you ever communicated with them through      your friends, say?<br><br>      G: Mm, yeah. We attempt to have these surrogate little discussions, but     ...<br><br>      K: Oh yeah? Because you work with Lisette... What&rsquo;s her last name?<br><br>      G: Larkins.<br><br>      K: Yeah. And she wrote the book <em>Talking with Extraterrestrials</em>?<br><br>      G: Uh huh.<br><br>      K: And... sounds like she communicates with someone out there.<br><br>      G: Yeah, She&rsquo;s... you can&rsquo;t attribute her level of intelligence      to going to school. It&rsquo;s just not there, that type of thinking and      the type of philosophy that she says that they advocate. And the way that      they see life and how we should live it is completely... it&rsquo;s not      anything that we currently enjoy. Yeah. So.<br><br>      K: All right. So you&rsquo;ve had dialogues through her...<br><br>      G: Anyhow, we&rsquo;re currently trying to set up contact.<br><br>      K: OK. Right.<br><br>      G: And I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll ever have any success at it.<br><br>      K: OK. So you... You don&rsquo;t know what the ET thinks of you.<br><br>      G: I... No, and I don&rsquo;t know whether or not they even think on that      level. We are trying to find out if they do. And it&rsquo;s been our experience      that women seem to run the future and... extraterrestrial societies are      supposedly lead and directed by women. So, the female side of the equation.      So we&rsquo;re very pro that idea because it&rsquo;s... Women don&rsquo;t      like war and don&rsquo;t like the consequences of war. We should have more      women in Congress. We&rsquo;d have a much more peaceful business of government.<br><br>      K: And doesn&rsquo;t a woman figure pretty prominently in your movie scenario?<br><br>      G: Yeah. We&rsquo;ve gotta... the judges and the prosecutors are women.      And we&rsquo;ve kind of looked at them as the &ldquo;ultra-terrestrial,&rdquo; the      folks that don&rsquo;t need spaceships to move around... they just think      and they&rsquo;re there. So yeah, yeah. I&rsquo;m... we&rsquo;re very      avant garde toward the idea of women being the leaders of tomorrow, not      men.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On John Lear</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Now didn&rsquo;t        you used to be friends with John Lear?<br><br>      G: Yeah. Yeah, we were good friends for a long time.<br><br>      K: OK. So, did you go to Area 51 with him? Or...<br><br>      G: No, I refused. The night that he and Bob Lazar got stopped out there      by the Wackenhut guys and all that... and all that whether or not it all      happened... If it happened, it seemed to me to be a kind of a set up routine.      And Dr. Uhlig... George Uhlig and I were friends, the Director of Research      and Development at Hercules, and we didn&rsquo;t want to go there.      We didn&rsquo;t want to go with John. We thought there was something smelly      about it, so we didn&rsquo;t go.<br>      <br>      K: You didn&rsquo;t go...<br><br>      G: And it pissed John off no end.<br><br>      K: Uh huh.<br><br>      G: So.<br><br>      K: But you... you remained friends after that?<br><br>      G: We... I knew his mom and dad before that time period. I go back to      the late &lsquo;60s with being affiliated with his father and knew his      mother, Moya, because she was very close to my friend John DeLorean and      that kind of thing.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On John DeLorean</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh. So what can you tell us about John DeLorean?<br><br>  G: It&rsquo;s a great sadness, believe me, when I say that he&rsquo;s gone.      Because he was one of the great men of all... of the twentieth century      in terms of his thinking... The idea of non-obsolescent cars by building      cars out of stainless steel and making cars where they didn&rsquo;t wear      out. Which is very possible. And they don&rsquo;t wanna do it... And so.      I thought... I worked very closely with him. We&rsquo;d been friends since      I was 15 years old. I met him out on the Bonneville Salt Flats when he      was sponsoring Mickey Thompson&rsquo;s land speed record car. John and      I go way, way back. I thought he was one of the great men of all time.      He really was.<br><br>      K: Sounds like he&rsquo;s to some degree an inspiration for what you&rsquo;re      doing now?<br><br>      G: He was grand mentor. He knew how to fight once he knew what he was fighting      and he and I were very close friends. And he allowed me to kick the crap      out of the FBI [smiles] so it was fun, to be very frank. And the FBI&rsquo;s      quite a formidable group of folks. But when I had John DeLorean as my associate      and client, it was easy to beat their brains out. And we beat &lsquo;em.<br><br>      K: But you&rsquo;re not a lawyer, so when you say he was your client, in      what way was he your client?<br><br>      G: I was his chief of strategic planning. You might call me a chief investigator,      like I am for Ramsey Clark. I&rsquo;ve been Ramsey&rsquo;s chief for...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On Ramsey Clark</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You&rsquo;re using present tense. You&rsquo;re        still working with Ramsey?<br><br>      G: Yes, yes, yeah. Still wor... But I didn&rsquo;t do Saddam. I&rsquo;m      not affiliated with the Saddam defense. I left him out. I&rsquo;m not bulletproof.      Ramsey&rsquo;s got a halo and nobody wants to kill a Ramsey. But I&rsquo;m      not sure they wouldn&rsquo;t do it to me. So... let&rsquo;s put it like      this. I... The stories I could tell you I don&rsquo;t wanna tell you about      that. It&rsquo;s a very dangerous game. Very, very dangerous, the defense      of Saddam Hussein. He had a couple of his lawyers murdered by the Ministry      of Interior and I think that the whole trial... I&rsquo;m not saying that      Saddam&rsquo;s a good guy... That the whole trial was a charade and it      shoulda been in the Hague a la Milosevic. And that trying him without a      Sunni judge on the bench and, ah, assassinating lawyers is not the way      you conduct a trial. You don&rsquo;t conduct a trial by killing off somebody&rsquo;s      defense lawyers. I&rsquo;m amazed that they didn&rsquo;t kill Ramsey Clark.<br><br>      K: OK. But didn&rsquo;t we set Saddam up to begin with anyway?<br><br>      G: Yeah, yeah. I mean, Saddam was like a sabertooth tiger. And after the      Iran/Iraq war and he was starving. And he jumped out in the middle of the      road to grab an antelope out there he thought he was gonna eat. And the      next thing he heard was &ldquo;Beep-Beep&rdquo; and an 18-wheeler aimed      at him, which was us invading him, you know.<br><br>      K: Kuwait.<br><br>      G: Kuwait. Yeah. I don&rsquo;t think Saddam should&rsquo;ve gone to Kuwait.      That was a dumb move and a very big mistake. But you gotta realize, they      called his loans and he didn&rsquo;t have any money to pay &lsquo;em, so      he called their country. You know, they shoulda left him alone and let      him restore his economy so that he could pay &lsquo;em off.<br><br>      K: What about the stargates? Do you believe in that?<br><br>      G: I don&rsquo;t believe in the stargates. I&rsquo;m not a fan of stargates.      I&rsquo;ve heard that they exist from people who claim that. But... in      fact, we use it in the movie, the technology of the weapons delivery system      of the first magnitude because there&rsquo;s no way to stop it. Bang. Opens      up over your planet and you&rsquo;ve got a nuke going off. How do you stop      that? There&rsquo;s no defense against a stargate for a weapons delivery      system. So, if they exist, they&rsquo;re the most formidable weapons delivery      system, other than a UFO, that could ever be. So, philosophically I&rsquo;d      like to see... I&rsquo;d like to see the elimination of the forms of government      that we have today that basically.... They&rsquo;re all over our rights.      You know, the Constitution&rsquo;s out the window. The Patriot Act is a      joke. It&rsquo;s a fascist document. <br><br>      K: So what do you think of the neocons?<br><br>      G: Gangsters. I&rsquo;d call &lsquo;em gang-banksters. I don&rsquo;t think      of anything... Anybody that can go off and put a war like Iraq together      and kill 150,000 people all deserve to be tried for war crimes. <br><br>      K: Uh huh.<br><br>      G: That&rsquo;s what I believe. They all oughta be hung for war crimes. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On Waco</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But you        were very involved in Waco, isn&rsquo;t that right?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: So what can you...

The ATF attacked &lsquo;em and they got      the response that they asked for because they knew what they were going      up against. And they blew off the front door and they killed everybody      standing around the front door. And, ah, they then hid the front door after      they... after they filled &lsquo;em full of bulletholes and actually came      and got &lsquo;em and got rid of &lsquo;em. They set the place on fire      and they blew &lsquo;em up and....<br><br>      K: Why? I mean, why? Do you know why?<br><br>      G: Apparently part of the games that they&rsquo;re playing to set us up      for 911 and some of the other things in order to create us into a neofascist      political police state...<br><br>      K: So that was something at the beginning?<br><br>      G: ...a quasi-military political police state.<br><br>      K: OK, but didn&rsquo;t you, ah, tell me that you got the FBI sort of into      a corner in that?<br><br>      G: Yeah. I got &lsquo;em with the FLIR [Forward-Looking Infra-Red] tape.      Myself and Bill Colby got together and we discovered that there was a lot      of gunshots in the FLIR tape and the government then put on a charade test      of it. The judge was the real culprit in the whole thing. He engineered      the whole assassination of all those people. Obliteration. <br><br>      K: But Janet Reno had complete control, didn&rsquo;t she?<br><br>      G: She did, but she was just there when the truck went by, or the bus went      by. And she wasn&rsquo;t there when they did it. And she came in a little      later and did it and she covered it all up. And she doesn&rsquo;t like      me a whole bunch and I don&rsquo;t like her a bunch.<br><br>      K: Uh huh.<br><br>      G: So that&rsquo;s... that&rsquo;s about the way we... I consider her      a criminal, you know, a major league criminal. So, I consider all those      people that assassinated those people... &lsquo;cause those were a bunch      of innocent people. <br><br>      K: There were children in there as well.<br><br>      G: Yeah, they killed 28 kids. I mean, but they&rsquo;ve killed 25,000 kids      in Iraq, so what&rsquo;s the big deal? <br><br>      K: Right.<br><br>      G: Maybe more. Thirty, 35,000 children have been murdered in this war over      there on terror. How do you have a war on terror? Terror and war are all      the same. It&rsquo;s all the same thing. One guy&rsquo;s terrorist is and      another man&rsquo;s freedom fighter and visa versa. So it&rsquo;s a BS      war and those people have... we should get outa there.<br><br>      <strong>911</strong><br><br>      K: OK. What about 911?<br><br>      G: I&rsquo;m a fan of Jim Marrs. You know... I&rsquo;m a believer that      we probably had a big hand in doing that too, based upon the demolition      of the buildings. You can see those puffs of smoke coming from the demolition      charges off the building. So that&rsquo;s not, you know... Do I believe      that they would do something like that? Yeah. Do I believe that they would      set it up? My answer is: Where&rsquo;s Osama bin Laden? I mean, this government      could find a roach in the Brazilian rain forest if it wanted to...<br><br>      K: [laughs]<br><br>      G: ...so where is Osama? And I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re trying      to catch him. I believe we have a deal with him and his family. The bin      Laden family and the Bush family are like that [shows crossed fingers],      so... Do I believe that this is an honorable government? The answer&rsquo;s      no. Do I believe that they&rsquo;re murderers and mass murderers? Yes.      Do I believe they oughta be prosecuted in an international tribunal as      war criminals? Yes. I think we need to get out of Vietna... I mean, not      Vietnam but&nbsp; Iraq. It&rsquo;s not much different. It&rsquo;s just      a horror show. We&rsquo;re just over there murdering people. We haven&rsquo;t      got any justification for it whatsoever. There&rsquo;s no just cause.<br><br>      K: Since that, you talk about... I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t even      get the lingo, but you&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;wet...&rdquo;<br><br>      G: I mean, when people try to kill you, you do what you gotta do to make      sure they don&rsquo;t or if they try to intimidate you and you make sure      that they don&rsquo;t do it.<br><br>      K: Well, Do you have a body guard? I mean you&rsquo;re pretty brave.<br><br>      G: No, no, no, no. I&rsquo;m pretty good at that myself.<br><br>      K: Oh, you are...<br><br>      G: I don&rsquo;t need... You can&rsquo;t trust bodyguards. They always      end up getting you killed.<br><br>      K: Really. <br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: And so... well, do you &ldquo;carry&rdquo;, as they say?<br><br>      G: No. No, no, no. I carry a relationship armed with the big guy that protects      me against assholes.<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: That&rsquo;s a good way to describe it.<br><br>      K: What&rsquo;s... what&rsquo;s MJ-12&rsquo;s absolute, sort of, agenda,      in your view? &lsquo;Cause I got a feel... I got a feel that you guys      are at cross purposes to some degree.<br><br>      G: Yeah, we are at cross purposes but it&rsquo;s because I want control      of their technology so I don&rsquo;t have to go through the R&amp;D process      on it. And we just wanta deploy it in order to prevent global warming &lsquo;cause      if you get rid of oil, coal, gas and nuclear you&rsquo;re going to get      rid of all the pollution of the planet.<br>      <br>      K: But why wouldn&rsquo;t MJ-12 want the same thing? Part of them do....<br><br>      G Because they click their heels to the Bilderbergers who basically would     ... are... They&rsquo;re power... they&rsquo;re green power. I mean,      they&rsquo;re the bankers of the world. So, their desire for power is greater      than their desire to protect their children and grandchildren from being      buried in the same grave with them. That&rsquo;s how I look at it.<br><br>      K: Well, you&rsquo;re familiar with Dan Burisch, right?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: And you&rsquo;ve expressed interest in working with him. Isn&rsquo;t      that true?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: So... why?<br><br>      G: Because he&rsquo;s got wires.<br><br>      K: He&rsquo;s got what?<br><br>      G: He&rsquo;s got wires in the places where we&rsquo;d like to have wires.<br><br>      K: Oh, you mean contact?<br><br>      G: Contact.<br><br>      K: OK. Are you also interested in what he knows?<br><br>      G: Mm...<br><br>      K: As a scientist?<br><br>      G: Mm. Some of it&rsquo;s interesting. But I am into the idea of being      able to make contact with extraterrestrials because I think it&rsquo;s      an excellent idea, that they could be helpful. <br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: They certainly have the knowledge of how to get past... they got past      the trial and tribulations this planet&rsquo;s going through...<br><br>      K: Right.<br><br>      G: ...in their own society and they evolved into what we believe to be      somewhat of... We don&rsquo;t call it utopian. We call it plutopian. Sort      of a madhouse of ideas that are completely different from what we view      as what we would call utopia. But the idea of getting rid of the cost of      energy in our economy is really good because that keeps 80 cents out of      every dollar you keep... you spend... stays in your pocket. You get rich      that way. Quick. Everybody gets rich.<br><br>      K: OK. So, when did you start working on this?<br><br>      G: Oh, probably in the early 70s I got involved in really trying to run      it to ground and doing the investigation in terms of trying to get our      hands on their technology and then we lucked into it one day and...<br><br>      K: When you say &ldquo;we,&rdquo; who&rsquo;s we?<br><br>      <strong>The Knights Temporal</strong><br><br>      G: Well, I have a group of folks that I call the Knights Temporal, that      are, ah .. the most prominent aerospace engineers and physicists in the      world today are all part of a team we call the RAM group. We call ourselves      the Knights Temporal. We took a page out of the idea of the Templars who      basically blackmailed the Pope to give them the fiefdoms over Europe. They      created the banking orders we have today. And so, but, that... Since we      believe the technology is rooted in time, we call ourselves the Knights      Temporal. The alien technology, the UFO, is basically a flying time machine.      That&rsquo;s what we believe, and it&rsquo;s all be know about it. It indicates      that.<br><br>      K: OK. So you believe in time travel but you don&rsquo;t believe in wormholes.      How is that possible?<br><br>      G: Well, because I don&rsquo;t need to worm-travel if I can get across      the universe fast enough. I mean, who wants a wormhole? I mean, a wormhole      is an idea that nobody has been able to show me any physics whatsoever      that can be happening. Maybe it can. I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems like      it&rsquo;s gonna take a lot of energy to keep that hole open.<br><br>      K: So do you have a degree in physics?<br><br>      G: No. I research it like I do all of my intelligence operations. I...<br><br>      K: Well, come on, are you a genius? [smiles]<br><br>      G: I always will say that the most unpleasant thing in life is to have      a 200 IQ in a 100 IQ world. So... do I? I don&rsquo;t know. I know that      I am constantly offended by the ignorant bastards that live on this planet      that I have to deal with all the time. And they&rsquo;re very dumb.<br><br>      K: And one of those ignorant bastards stole your girlfriend? Is that right?<br><br>      G: Which one? Which one stole...?<br><br>      K: I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m asking you.<br><br>      G: Oh... what they did was they basically knew that I was working on paradox      research for a university... one of the universities that we have involved      in it... and that they knew that I was fooling around with something that      was very psychologically dangerous. And they took the advantage to take      some love letters and rewrite &lsquo;em like you would fake a tape, and      sent &lsquo;em off to her and she took umbrage and I haven&rsquo;t been      able to put it back.<br><br>      K: And you&rsquo;re looking, maybe, with your movie, to, ah, rekindle your      love of your life?<br><br>      G: Yeah... I mean, I&rsquo;d give my right arm to do that but, you know,      if she wants to... As I&rsquo;ve told her, she&rsquo;s gonna have to stand      behind the Ashley Judds and the...<br><br>      K: Oh come on, now.<br><br>      G: ...the Janine Turners and the Salma Hayeks to get the job unless she&rsquo;s      sweet...<br><br>      K: OK. So what else can you tell us about why you pursue this with such      really almost... I don&rsquo;t know... fanaticism.<br><br>      G: Pursue what?<br><br>      K: Your idea for this craft. Building a UFO and...<br><br>      G: Well, we&rsquo;re not really interested so much in building the craft      as... I mean, building a starship&rsquo;s wonderful because the craft      are shuttlecraft. The UFO is the shuttlecraft for a starship...<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: ...in most instances. And not to say that they can&rsquo;t get across      as quick. It&rsquo;s just a lot more dangerous when you don&rsquo;t have      a support system. So, what we believe is... is that the idea is to make      power, make electrical power, be able to replace... be able to put what      might look like a silo at a utility grid site where they have a relay station      and just put that there and get a gigawatt out of it. And that... if you      can mass produce those toys and get rid of the need to pump oil into the      fuel reactors that we have out there to... that make power and cars and      planes and boats and trains and everything else is unnecessary. You can      get rid of all that at. You don&rsquo;t have to fly it initially but you      definitely have to get rid of it. We don&rsquo;t need petro-burning machines      and we don&rsquo;t need to waste a lot of time going through all of this      evolution of hydrogen economy &lsquo;cause it takes a barrel of oil to      make a barrel of hydrogen and that&rsquo;s a charade.<br><br>      K: OK. But what&rsquo;s going to happen, if there&rsquo;re Earth changes,      to your ideas?<br><br>      G: Well, we&rsquo;re in favor of being able to make changes to the Earth      changes. Quickly. We&rsquo;re in a race to try to get this technology developed      before the Earth is... I don&rsquo;t call it global warming. I call it      global burning. I mean, it&rsquo;s getting hot. It&rsquo;s getting really      hot. And it&rsquo;s... I mean, when you see the...<br><br>      K: Well, isn&rsquo;t this the sun and the solar flares got something to      do with...<br><br>      G: Some people say that. But, I mean, it&rsquo;s obvious that... from Vice      President Gore&rsquo;s film, <em>Unintended Consequences,</em> or whatever      he called it... we are heating up the upper atmosphere by pumping carbon      dioxide out the tail pipes of our cars and out of our planes and out of      our trains and out of our boats and out of our everything.<br><br>      K: So this is the time bomb that you think you&rsquo;re up against, is      global warming.<br><br>      G: Yeah. I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard the tales about the black planet coming      through and...<br><br>      K: Nibiru?<br><br>      G: ...and all that. You know, show me. I&rsquo;m from Missouri. You gotta      show me a picture of it coming, and then I&rsquo;ll buy it. But they tell      me it&rsquo;s there and, I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard stories about it, but      I mean, for me, it&rsquo;s... you know, I think ET keeps us here. ET created      us and ET&rsquo;s purpose is to keep this little laboratory, uh, called      Earth going forward toward evolution so that we can grow up to become extraterrestrials      and spread our seed out through the universe and basically spread life,      which is the prime directive. Not to go where no man&rsquo;s gone before.      Just to <em>go</em>. And to take life out there because there&rsquo;s probably      more places to put life than there is people to put on it. A lot of planets. <br><br>      K: OK. Well, that&rsquo;s actually a beautiful idea. <br><br>      G: Well, the best thing I can think of to do. I mean it&rsquo;s... I&rsquo;ve      got enough time in my life to do it.<br><br>      K: And do you think you&rsquo;re going to last? That you&rsquo;re going      to deliver this time?<br><br>      G: Well, you know, all you can do in going up Everest is try, you know.      I mean, do you make it to the top or do you don&rsquo;t? I mean, it&rsquo;s      not the accomplishment of getting to the top. It&rsquo;s the doing of trying      to do the deed. You know, if you don&rsquo;t do the deed, at least you      tried, you know. They can&rsquo;t say that you weren&rsquo;t a serious      type of human being, you know.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On Watergate</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: We&rsquo;re        going to kind of backtrack a little bit and we&rsquo;re        going to ask you about Watergate...<br><br>      G: OK.<br><br>      K: ...because, now, if I understand, you wired the Oval Office?<br><br>      G: Yeah. I put in an electronic countermeasures system to defeat people      bugging the Oval Office...<br><br>      K: OK. And that was...<br><br>      G: ...bugging conversations and recording any conversations in the room.<br><br>      K: Right. But were you involved in also, supposedly...<br><br>      G: Erasing all the tapes. Yeah.<br><br>      K: ...erasing all Nixon&rsquo;s tapes. Right.<br><br>      G: Uh huh. It was a good idea.<br><br>      K: It was a good idea.<br><br>      G: I wish I&rsquo;da done it.<br><br>      K: OK. But they weren&rsquo;t erased. You heard them then, right?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: You must have heard...<br><br>      G: All 4004 tapes.<br><br>      K: Yeah... and so what can you tell us? What do you know?<br><br>      G: I think if I had, knowing the level of intrigue that was going on...      and what Watergate was really all about was much of a cover-up of why we      lost the war in Vietnam. It was... they were about to have Senate hearings     ... [gestures at camera] Is this on?<br><br>      K: Yeah.<br><br>      G: They were about to have Senate hearings about a postmortem on Vietnam      and they... The powers that be elected to create Watergate to take our      attention away from the postmortem. And the Senate and the House intelligence      committees became so busy with Watergate that they couldn&rsquo;t do the      postmortem on Vietnam, which I believe was the crime of crimes. It was      a terrible crime. We were over there to just get money and take the money      out the Golden Triangle for dope and take it out to Area 51.<br><br>      K: So you&rsquo;re saying that the money for dope went straight to Area      51.<br><br>      G: The whole Vietnam exercise and killing 55,000 Americans and about 2      million Vietnamese was for the purposes of operating the Golden Triangle&rsquo;s      heroin operations in order to pump the money into Area 51, because it had     ... They couldn&rsquo;t fund it except by going off balance sheets. They      did Vietnam and then they did Afghanistan in the 80s and then they did      Columbia in the 90s with the cocaine, the crack cocaine crap. Which is      as evil as evil gets. <br><br>      K: And so basically you&rsquo;re saying that our government is running      the drugs?<br><br>      G: [shakes head no] I&rsquo;m saying that Majestic is an arm .. is no longer      part of the government of the United States. It&rsquo;s run... It&rsquo;s      been privatized and it&rsquo;s run by the people that run the world.<br><br>      K: OK. So you&rsquo;re alluding to the fact that Majestic is responsible      for running the drugs. Is that what you&rsquo;re saying?<br><br>      G: Yeah, with the help of other agencies, the government. They moved a      lot of that money.<br><br>      K: The FBI?<br><br>      G: Sort of. Maybe. Probably. Probably.<br><br>      K: And not the CIA? I mean, everyone...<br><br>      G: Probably.<br><br>      K: ...says the CIA&rsquo;s involved in all that.<br><br>      G: Yeah. But I&rsquo;m not gonna throw rocks at &lsquo;em. They did what      they did, but, you know, they thought that they were doing the right thing.      Mark Felt, when he told Bob Woodward that the whole reason for Watergate      was all about covering up the Vietnamese operations, the drug sales, and      the Golden Triangle, to supply the money to do the back engineering of      the UFO, which cost billions upon billions upon billions, hundred billion      plus.<br><br>      K: To back-engineer the UFO.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Crash        at Roswell</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G: Yeah.

It&rsquo;s all out there.<br><br>      K: Did Nixon know?<br><br>      G: Probably.<br><br>      K: Probably?<br><br>      G: Probably.<br><br>      K: Are you saying &ldquo;probably&rdquo; &lsquo;cause you know or are you      saying &ldquo;probably&rdquo; because you don&rsquo;t want to be...<br><br>      G: I&rsquo;m just saying probably.<br><br>      K: ...on the record saying...<br><br>      G: I don&rsquo;t wanna go on the record. I don&rsquo;t know that he knew      for a fact but I had information when I was at the White House that he      was doing that.<br><br>      K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>McCord and Liddy</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G: That he        recognized that Watergate was an exercise that he didn&rsquo;t      understand, by intelligence operatives that were just a bit sharper than      him. Like McCord&rsquo;s finding the... putting the tape on the door twice      so that the guard would get him arrested, and that kind of crap. It&rsquo;s      beyond the pale. Anybody that... if you find that somebody has taken the      tape off the door that you&rsquo;re using so that you can exit the place,      and you go put it back, then all you&rsquo;re asking for is to get arrested.      So McCord, in my opinion, set the President up. And Liddy was the pawn      and he was used miserably by the guys who gave him the Gemstone graphics      that were used that caused all of Watergate. Just what I know.<br>      <br>      K: Uh huh. And can you tell me about the... didn&rsquo;t they develop      the whole idea of the Manchurian candidate during the Vietnam war?<br><br>      G: Well, Laurence Harvey, the actor, probably might be able to tell you      more about that than me. But the answer is that that technology&rsquo;s      probably been around a while. So, you know, the ability to get people who      are... I&rsquo;m trying to get the word. Somnambulistic &hellip; where      they&rsquo;re subject to being hypnotized in a second and whatever you      tell them to do, they&rsquo;ll do.<br><br>      K: But this is MK-ULTRA we&rsquo;re talking about.<br><br>      G: Yeah. MK-ULTRA had a major league play in all of this. So, you know,      who&rsquo;s running MK-ULTRA type of research now? It&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s      guess. It isn&rsquo;t the CIA any more. I like to think I had a hand in      causing that go to away from Langley. <br><br>      K: You want us to believe that Langley&rsquo;s not involved in that and      other people are?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: Because you know, the idea is that you had started working with them     ...<br><br>      G: I&rsquo;ve never known the CIA to be a bunch of assassins. They&rsquo;re      just too classy. They&rsquo;re not into whacking people as a course of      reality.<br><br>      K: And you&rsquo;re not holding onto any kind of notion of honor because      this is the only shred of honor left on the planet that you can believe      in?<br><br>      G: I have never known anyone that I&rsquo;ve ever been associated with      in the CIA to be a criminal.

I don&rsquo;t think he was a nice guy.<br><br>  K: OK. He wasn&rsquo;t a nice guy. He spied on everyone, right?<br><br>  G: Mm. That&rsquo;s indicated. Yeah.<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: That&rsquo;s probably true.<br><br>      K: And... but what did you had some kind of real dealings with Hoover,      didn&rsquo;t you?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: Do you want to tell us about that?<br><br>      G: All that you&rsquo;re gonna do is you&rsquo;re gonna... This is gonna      piss off the FBI and they&rsquo;re gonna wanta fight some more, and I don&rsquo;t      wanna fight with them. I mean, I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;m the      guy who put the dress on him. He deserved to wear the dress. So let&rsquo;s      leave it at that.<br><br>      K: Is Colby dead?<br><br>      G: Yes.<br><br>      K: How&rsquo;d he die?<br><br>      G: He drowned in three feet of water. [smiles] <br><br>      K: How do you do that?<br><br>      G: You get pushed... you get your head pushed under the water. <br><br>      K: I see. And you know who did this deed, so to speak?<br><br>      G: Ah... there was a lot of dying going on around the FLIR tape at Waco.      And the chief, he guy that did the forensic work, he croaked at his desk,      sitting at his desk. He just suddenly decided to die and nobody ever gave      me a decent pathology report on his autopsy. Colby was right in the middle      of it. He was the one who helped me get it all out. And so we thought it      was gonna sink the FBI. I mean, the CIA was very anti-FBI in that timeframe,      and they were in my corner. I mean, it&rsquo;s a well known fact... they      were really in my corner. So what we were doing was trying to prevent any      more assaults on religion by the FBI. We were not... you know... leave      the kids alone. Don&rsquo;t kill the kiddies. And that was, ah... Mr.      Clark is, in my opinion... and a lot of people think he&rsquo;s the grand      contrarian. He may well be, but I&rsquo;m... and remember, I come from      a Republican background so when people talk to me about Ramsey, I tell &lsquo;em, &ldquo;Look,      he&rsquo;s got a halo.&rdquo; Far as I&rsquo;m concerned, if I can get      him canonized as a saint when he dies, I&rsquo;m gonna do it. &lsquo;Cause      I think he&rsquo;s a saintly man. He&rsquo;s represented all the bad guys      over... But they deserve to have the best representation they can get.      Everybody deserves a lawyer, OK? I don&rsquo;t care what you accuse people      of, they deserve the best representation they can get. And I&rsquo;ve known      a lot of them over the years, including directors.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On Bobby Ray        Inman</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And what        about Bobby Inman? What&rsquo;s he involved in?<br><br>      G: [smiles] He&rsquo;s reputedly ah, MJ-4, but whether he is or not I don&rsquo;t      know. He&rsquo;s a nice guy. He and I are friendly, so I&rsquo;m not going      to say anything negative about Bob. I don&rsquo;t know anything negative.<br><br>      K: So, isn&rsquo;t he part of Disclosure. Didn&rsquo;t we hear that?<br><br>      G: We hear it, but, you know, it&rsquo;s one thing to hear it and it&rsquo;s      another thing to do it. You know, it&rsquo;s one thing to say it. It&rsquo;s      another thing to do it. So...<br><br>      <strong>On John Gannon</strong><br><br>      K: What about John Gannon? You know who he is?<br><br>      G: Yeah, but I...<br><br>      K: Do you think he&rsquo;s involved in Serpo?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On Serpo</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G: I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not a fan of Serpo, you know. I&rsquo;m      kind of negative toward &ldquo;Beyond Disclosure&rdquo; and that kind of      stuff.<br><br>      K: You&rsquo;re negative... what do you mean you&rsquo;re negative to &ldquo;Beyond      Disclosure&rdquo;?<br><br>      G: I think that the people who... that there are a lot of people out there      that supposedly are pro-disclosure are nothing but MJ-12 disinformation      ops. And they probably operate under the cover of the DIA, who I have a      great admiration for also. I&rsquo;ve never known those guys to be really      bad other than... do this disinformation thing. They seem to be a heavy      hand in the disinformation game, you see.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On Paul Bennewitz</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What about Bennewitz.

But apparently        if he was they made sure they greased the slope a bunch for him. So I        always thought Bennewitz was a terrible crime.

He once threatened to kill      John Lear over me, and... I was there the night they did it and he thought      that I was Majestic and that was just BS in the maximum. And so Cooper      probably peed-off the cops enough to get himself shot. So... you know     ...<br><br>      K: Well, he was heavily involved in outing Waco the way you were.<br><br>      G: The difference between him and me outing Waco is I was actually physically      doing it and putting it into the record of the case. I was actually doing      the investigations that brought up all the crap, that... you know...      burning &lsquo;em up and gassing &lsquo;em and shooting &lsquo;em and just      basically murdering &lsquo;em. <br><br>      K: When you say you were involved in the investigation, does that mean      you do your own investigation or you have somebody do it for you?<br><br>      G: Mm. I did my own investigations for Mr. Clark. Yeah, and I provided     ...<br><br>      K: Does that mean interviewing people? Does that mean researching...<br><br>      G: That meant everything. I interviewed all of Koresh&rsquo;s wives and      got to talk about his sex habits and da-da-da-da, which was cute. And,      so yes, I got to interview everybody and I was well known for doing that.      I was very proud of it... The fact that we lost says something to do with      our fascist judicial system.<br><br>      K: So do you think that... Operation Paperclip... they brought a bunch      of Nazis over here... <br><br>      G: [nods head yes]<br><br>      K: I mean... Tell me you&rsquo;re not using some of those Nazis in your      group.<br><br>      G: Well, they&rsquo;re not part of <em>my</em> group and they&rsquo;re      gone. They&rsquo;re mostly <em>dead</em>. I mean, all those Nazis from      World War Two, the scientists that... Bethe and all those guys,      they&rsquo;re all gone. Kammer, they&rsquo;re gone. So there&rsquo;s      no...<br>      <br>      K: But they had a big hand...<br><br>      G: They&rsquo;d be 90 years... they&rsquo;d be 105 years old.<br><br>      K: OK. But they had a big hand in the development of the atomic bomb.<br><br>      G: Yeah... man, I&rsquo;m a strong believer that Farrell wrote a good      book when he wrote <em>SS: Brotherhood of the Bell</em> recently. Good.      Very good. So I believe the Nazis&rsquo; influence is out there. We can      see the neocon fascism in our government today is out there, so do I believe      the Nazis are gone? No, I think they&rsquo;re still active. Many of them.      And they still believe the same evil crap they did then.<br><br>      K: So you&rsquo;ve never met an ET. Have you been curious? I mean, you&rsquo;ve      got hands in every pot, it sounds to me. Can&rsquo;t you get an introduction      to an ET?<br><br>      G: Yeah, we&rsquo;re working on that. We&rsquo;re...<br><br>      K: You are?<br><br>      G: We&rsquo;re doing the best we can with the tools we&rsquo;ve got to      do it with. But yes, we&rsquo;re... <br><br>      K: Have you been to Area 51, underground?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On Dulce</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G: Have I        been inside of it? No. Dulce&rsquo;s the... We did a thorough      search for the underground area of Dulce. And I mean thorough. And it&rsquo;s      bullshit. It&rsquo;s pure unadulterated BS. There&rsquo;s no underground      base at Dulce. We wanted to get in. [laughs] We just wanted to get in.      We bought into the disinformation long enough to get close enough. And      we spent four, five days trekking the Archuleta Mesa and went all over      the place. And used seismometers and everything to try to find out if there      were underground holes. And we didn&rsquo;t find any of that.<br><br>      K: Did you use any native Americans to help you out?<br><br>      G: Yeah. Yeah. We talked to all the Apaches out there and it&rsquo;s just      BS. Just BS. It&rsquo;s a disinformation operation.<br><br>      K: And you wouldn&rsquo;t be pushing disinfo right now by telling me that.<br><br>      G: No. I&rsquo;ll betcha a billion that you can&rsquo;t find a hole in      the side of Archuleta Mesa in which you can access an alien underground      base there. And I&rsquo;ll bet you a billion and I&rsquo;d bet my life      on it &lsquo;cause I went over the place with a fine tooth comb.<br><br>      K: OK. What about underground LA?<br><br>      G: Well, I mean, anything&rsquo;s possible. I mean, they got tunnels that&rsquo;ll     ... They got tunneling equipment that is nuclear powered. They can drill      tunnels anywhere they want from anywhere, so...<br><br>      K: What about under the Capitol?<br><br>      G: I believe anything&rsquo;s possible if you want to spend the money.<br><br>      K: No. I&rsquo;m not interested in what you what you believe. I&rsquo;m      interested in what you know.<br><br>      G: No. I don&rsquo;t know of any underground systems. I&rsquo;m sure that      they exist, I just don&rsquo;t know where they...<br><br>      K: You wired the White House and you don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s      an underground base there?<br><br>      G: Well, yeah, remember I did that when I was the guy who built the toy      that made it work and so that was why I was there. There was no other reason      for me to be there than the fact that I supplied the checkmate system to      do it. So obviously when they needed an installer to put it in... I put      it in there and put it in Ellis Ranch and other places.<br><br>      <strong>Montauk and the Philadelphia Experiment...</strong><br><br>      K: What about Montauk? Are you familiar with Montauk?<br><br>      G: Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t believe it. <br><br>      K: You don&rsquo;t beli... What about the Philadelphia? These are...<br><br>      G: I believe that the Philadelphia experiment probably took place and that      they may have done it but I have no proof that they did do it. I haven&rsquo;t      seen a scintilla of an iota of really substantive evidence that any of      that&rsquo;s true. It sounds to me like a disinformation story meant to      lead you away from the technology. <br><br>      K: OK. Are you familiar with Wilhelm Reich?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: What about Wilhelm Reich and orgone?<br><br>      G: I think he just made... I think he probably got the Food and Drug Administration      really angry at him, with his cures. And maybe his cures were real and      they didn&rsquo;t want him to do it and they just said, &ldquo;Hey you      gotta go. We can&rsquo;t afford you around. You&rsquo;re gonna put the      doctors out of business so we&rsquo;re gonna get rid... We&rsquo;re gonna      put your ass in jail.&rdquo; They have the capability to frame their mothers.      And they will. So. I&rsquo;m a real fan of their ability to create fake      tapes and fake documents and fake this and fake photographs and fake videos,      fake anything. They can fake it all to the point where forensically you      can&rsquo;t tell reality from surreality and bullshit. <br><br>      K: OK. Well, along those lines, I understand that Majestic had a hand in      faking emails between you and John Lear that added to the animosity between      you. Is that right?<br><br>      G: Yeah. They did that and I&rsquo;m not sure John Lear didn&rsquo;t have      a part of it himself, you know? So... yeah, they actually did that and      they faked some other videos, and...<br><br>      <strong>On Kit Green</strong><br><br>      K: Are you able to talk about Kit Green at all?<br><br>      G: No. I have nothing to say about Dr. Green. I believe he&rsquo;s the      world&rsquo;s greatest neurobiologist and one thing and another. I think     ...<br><br>      K: Is he called in on alien autopsies? Do you know that much?<br><br>      G: I&rsquo;ve heard it but I don&rsquo;t know what to believe. He has never      said it to me. I know that he recently notified me that a bunch of his      emails were being faked and that there was stuff that was being attributed      to him that was obviously coming out of Majestic&rsquo;s gang. Probably      using an NSA cutout to do it.<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: NSA technology... They can bug your phone, bug your computer and they      can figure it... They can read all your email traffic and they know exactly      what they want to put in your next email in order to destabilize your relationship      with whoever you&rsquo;re talking to. So yeah. But Kit Green&rsquo;s a      great guy as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. I have no problem with Kit. He&rsquo;s      not an enemy.

So,        Jim Marrs... he&rsquo;s a wonderful Ufologist, he&rsquo;s a      wonderful writer.<br><br>      G: He&rsquo;s a member of our team. <br><br>      K: He&rsquo;s a member of your team...<br><br>      G: He&rsquo;s a historical scribe for the RAM group and he&rsquo;s hopefully      my biographer. They tell me that he&rsquo;s gonna do my biography and that&rsquo;s      as complimentary as I can get. <br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: He&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s greatest conspiracy theorist. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On Eric Julien</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Now isn&rsquo;t it true that you&rsquo;re        working with Eric Julien a little bit nowadays?<br><br>      G: Yeah, yeah. So...<br><br>      K: He&rsquo;s written a book on... Supposedly he had ET visitation. He      went up and flew a craft. He knows how they work. Is he going to help you?<br><br>      G: Mm. Yeah, and I&rsquo;m gonna help him. I&rsquo;ll be helping him more      than he&rsquo;s helping me right now. But the answer is yeah, he&rsquo;s      a very bright guy. He may be the Copernicus of the 21st century. But we&rsquo;ve      gotta find out that. He and I&rsquo;ve got to have a lot of dialogues about      reality. So. But we&rsquo;re getting there because a lot of the stuff that      he&rsquo;s talkin about, we&rsquo;ve already found out about. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On Hal Puthoff and Jack Sarfatti</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. What about Jack Sarfatti and Hal Puthoff? You working with these      guys?<br><br>      G: Hal and Jack are like Mike &amp; Ike... <br><br>      K: [laughs]<br><br>      G: ...or Alfonse &amp; Gaston or Abbott &amp; Costello, Laurel &amp; Hardy.      I mean, all they do is fight each other and castigate and criticize each      other.<br><br>      K: Well, do they know anything? Come on, these are... Hal Puthoff is a      renowned...<br><br>      G: Yeah, they got a... it&rsquo;s sort of like everybody... it&rsquo;s      like they&rsquo;ve got a little piece of the puzzle. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve      got the proverbial elephant. Somebody&rsquo;s got a piece of the tail,      another guy&rsquo;s got a leg, another guy&rsquo;s got a trunk. Everybody&rsquo;s      blindfolded. So they all have a little piece of the elephant but they don&rsquo;t      know the whole elephant. So, you know...<br><br>      K: Do they try to work with you?<br><br>      G: Oh yeah, yeah. We get along fine. I get along fine with Hal and Jack.      Jack doesn&rsquo;t... Jack is sort of a bit of a... monumental maniacal      ego with a huge NIH &ndash; not invented here &ndash; factor and Hal is      a much more level guy with different ideas. And one of &lsquo;em is into      white zero-point, and the other one&rsquo;s into dark energy zero-point      and they have their theories. And we don&rsquo;t even believe in any of      that. So. We have our own theories. Our theories are based upon having      discovered what we have discovered. But... Hal is the chief scientist      and Sarfatti&rsquo;s welcome to come aboard, but he&rsquo;s gotta stop      throwing rotten tomatoes at Hal.<br><br>      K: What do you mean? Hal&rsquo;s <em>your</em> chief scientist?<br><br>      G: The last time I checked.<br><br>      K: Really?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: How about that.<br><br>      G: How &lsquo;bout that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It&rsquo;s a matter of record.<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: So, they all attend the meetings of the gang, whenever the gang&rsquo;s      coming together and they stay tuned to it because it&rsquo;s an alternative      to what they&rsquo;re doing and they&rsquo;ve gotta keep a bet on that      horse. It&rsquo;s a... in a horse race of three or four horses you&rsquo;ve      gotta keep a bet on all of &lsquo;em.<br><br>      K: You&rsquo;ve got some remote viewers on your team?<br><br>      G: Well, Hal Puthoff is pretty much of a remote viewer. I mean, he pretty      much... him and Ingo Swann invented the stuff, so the answer is yes.<br><br>      K: Are you saying Ingo&rsquo;s part of your team?<br><br>      G: No. I&rsquo;m just saying that we&rsquo;ve got remote viewers. We use      remote viewers... for security purposes.<br><br>      K: OK. So you know you&rsquo;re gonna be successful?<br><br>      G: I proctoscope the government every so often with remote viewers, yeah.<br><br>      K: Uh huh.<br><br>      G: Just like, they proctoscope me, I proctoscope them. Except I... <br><br>      K: OK. Are you going to be successful? I mean, are they telling you the      future?<br><br>      G: I think the only reason I&rsquo;m not dead at this point is that they      know I&rsquo;ll win. They know from forward time scanning that me and,      we&rsquo;ll call it me and my coterie of... ah, patriots... we call ourselves      the Earth Patriots in the film. And so we went... you know, we can&rsquo;t      lose. <br><br>      K: Wow.<br><br>      G: The planet must continue. God didn&rsquo;t develop and go through all      of this and create this giant civilization just to wipe it out just because      somebody didn&rsquo;t wanna stop burning oil.<br><br>      K: What is this about Starport that you&rsquo;re trying to tell us about?<br><br>      G: Well, you logically can&rsquo;t go forward toward the development of      starship technology unless you&rsquo;re gonna build starships. And where      you gonna build starships? There&rsquo;s only one plant big enough on the      planet to do that and that&rsquo;s the Mitsu facility where the Saturn      S1B and the Saturn Five &ndash; those were the moon rockets &ndash; and      the Shuttle main tank are done because it&rsquo;s got the largest bay area.      And that&rsquo;s where we believe they&rsquo;re gonna be built. And it      sits in the middle of a piece of property that we&rsquo;re working now      with the governor of Louisiana to develop into a project called Starport,      which is an air, sea, rail, truck, container, and space port for launching      starships into... as freighters and as aircraft to move passengers. And      like, you know, we&rsquo;ll probably make it, with the right alien...      with the right antigravity technologies... you can probably make a trip      from New Orleans to Shanghai or Osaka in 20 minutes or less. We see a completely      different civilization coming. Completely. Of an extremely revolutionary      condition that&rsquo;s inevitable. It has to happen. <br><br>      K: Uh huh. What year do you think this is gonna happen?<br><br>      G: Well, as fast as we can get our little programs rolling along, and they&rsquo;re      rolling along real well. So I can only tell you that we look to see the      technology begin to go into mass production before the end of the decade.<br><br>      K: Well, who runs this little consortium that you&rsquo;re putting together?      Is it you?<br><br>      G: I&rsquo;m sort of director general of the project right now, but that      doesn&rsquo;t mean that I wanna stay there. I&rsquo;m just doing the thing.      We&rsquo;re trying to take a former minister of defense from another foreign      country, to have him take over the project and get me out of the loop of      having to deal with the daily mundane problems and the daily development      of the consortium. It&rsquo;s like Airbus... <br><br>      K: Can you tell us who that is?<br><br>      G: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Time paradoxes</strong></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G: We&rsquo;re there. I mean, we&rsquo;re dealing with &lsquo;em and they      know we&rsquo;re there and they know what we have. There are a lot of people      that know that we borrowed, expropriated, pirated the technology from Majestic      and we&rsquo;re not giving it back. It&rsquo;s that elemental. And so we&rsquo;re      developing it and we&rsquo;re doing it in a way that overcomes the problems      that they recognize. One of the big reasons that they don&rsquo;t wanna      do it is time paradoxes. Time paradoxes is a huge problem for &lsquo;em      because if you know the future then how do you have markets? How do you      have interest? How do you have taxes? How do you have government? How do      you...<br><br>      K: How do you have free will?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: Isn&rsquo;t that one of your issues?<br><br>      G: Well... I&rsquo;ve been Nietzschean until I discovered this and I&rsquo;m      now at the point where if somebody could give me a script and I could go      out tomorrow and enjoy my life and just carry out my tomorrow diktat from      the... we&rsquo;ll call it the time forward scan TV, that I could see      what I&rsquo;ve gotta do next month, that&rsquo;d be fine. Go live my life      and follow the orders. God wrote the script. Why not do it? He knows what      he&rsquo;s doing. We&rsquo;re all apiece of him and... why not do it his      way? I mean, his way may be a lot better than our way. Free will may not      be all that big a deal. You know, who cares...<br><br>      K: Come on. Aren&rsquo;t you the biggest rebel of all time?<br><br>      G: [long pause] But I&rsquo;m not a rebel against the stuff that I believe      is the reality we may have to live with. I mean, so what...?<br><br>      K: So you mean you&rsquo;re a practical rebel?<br><br>      G: I&rsquo;m a pragmatist. I&rsquo;m a pragmatic rebel. If I see that this&rsquo;s      the way it&rsquo;s gotta be and if I can facilitate making it happen and      it makes the world a better place to live, then great, you know. I mean,      I&rsquo;m not anti that.<br><br>      K: So, am I to understand that you killed a man?<br><br>      G: No. Never.<br><br>      K: Never?<br><br>      G: Never, never, ever.<br><br>      K: Have you ever ordered a man to be killed?<br><br>      G: No. No, no.<br><br>      K: So you&rsquo;ve got a lot of threats going back and forth, but no....<br><br>      G: There are a lot of threats, but there&rsquo;s the... You know... There&rsquo;s      the, &ldquo;You hurt me, I&rsquo;m gonna hurt you back and how I hurt you      back may not be the way you hurt me.&rdquo; And so they know, that if you&rsquo;re      that... If you have those kind of capabilities of doing dirty tricks...      Most people don&rsquo;t wanna have a guy who has a philosophy of, &ldquo;If      you have nothing to do for the rest of your life, go ahead and pick a fight      with me.&rdquo;<br><br>      I was there when the bus went by and the little door opened on the bus      and a mechanical arm grabbed me and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna take      this ride down on this bus in history.&rdquo; And that was it, I couldn&rsquo;t      get away from it. It was meant to happen. It was there. If I had to do      it over again, I&rsquo;d avoid it. If I could go back and say I&rsquo;m      not gonna be Garrison&rsquo;s chief of security, I&rsquo;m not gonna get      involved with the White House, I&rsquo;m not gonna get involved with the      CIA, I ain&rsquo;t gonna get involved with picking fights with Mr. Hoover,      and that kinda stuff, I would avoid it like the plague. &lsquo;Cause it      cost me. It cost me a wife, three kids, 10 or 15 million dollars and five      years of my life. So I don&rsquo;t want any more of that.<br><br>      K: When do you think you&rsquo;re going to actually be successful? I mean     ...<br><br>      G: If we get the money for this movie, we <em>are</em> successful. We will      be making a movie about what we&rsquo;re actually doing. It&rsquo;s basically      a docudrama hidden inside of a drama, wrapped inside of an enigma and on      and on, and a mystery. And so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.<br><br>      K: And have you gotten anybody in Hollywood interested?<br><br>      G: Oh yeah.<br><br>      K: Anyone we&rsquo;d know?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: Like?<br><br>      G: Like... all of &lsquo;em... the brass. The moguls, the titans.<br><br>      K: Oh yeah?<br><br>      G: Yeah.<br><br>      K: So they take you seriously.<br><br>      G: They take me and my friends at Langley seriously, is a good way to put      it. And they take our relationships and our evidence and all the rest of      it... We&rsquo;ve got it... This is all well documented. Very well documented.<br><br>      K: So when do you start filming?<br><br>      G: Ah. I would hope that it might be the middle of next year sometime after      we finish the scripts and get ourselves into production. Scripts as opposed      to just fat treatments for directors and stuff like that. So the answer      is: as fast as we can go there.<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: So we&rsquo;re making headway. And there isn&rsquo;t much that the Majestic      gang of... ah, sick bastards can do about it. And they know what the consequences      these days are gonna be if we catch &lsquo;em playing in our backyard any      more. I mean, it doesn&rsquo;... they can&rsquo;t send... It&rsquo;s      COINTELPRO, counter intelligence proactive. Same crap that was done in      the &lsquo;60s against the peace movement is done now except it&rsquo;s      much more sophisticated and very strange and very psychological operations      oriented. So they know what the price of dealing with us is gonna be. It&rsquo;s      gonna be very expensive. &lsquo;Cause we know exactly where to put our      torpedoes. They&rsquo;re all exposed. We know who they are.<br><br>      K: OK. But isn&rsquo;t it true that the government, or... the secret government     ... already has crafts up there?<br><br>      G: Sure.<br><br>      K: I mean, in essence they&rsquo;ve got the technology.<br><br>      G: Yeah, but they can&rsquo;t...<br><br>      K: They&rsquo;ve been dealing with ET for 40 years...<br><br>      G: So what? I own the intellectual property. I...<br><br>      K: So what do... I mean, they&rsquo;ve been manufacturing craft that we      see in our skies.<br><br>      G: They&rsquo;re not manufacturing a lot of &lsquo;em. <br><br>      K: They&rsquo;re not?<br><br>      G: You see &lsquo;em in a lot of places &lsquo;cause they move quick but      there&rsquo;s not a lot of &lsquo;em and...<br><br>      K: Black triangles?<br><br>      G: So what? You know, that&rsquo;s nothing more than a UFO inside of something      that looks like an F117A to be able to bullshit the public as they come      down the rural farm roads: &ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s an F117. It&rsquo;s      just going slow.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s bullshit. It&rsquo;s all a game. It&rsquo;s      all psyops. Psyops 101. <br><br>      K: Uh huh.<br><br>      G: So. No, I&rsquo;m not worried about &lsquo;em. I&rsquo;m not worried      about &lsquo;em a bit. They&rsquo;d better be worried about us &lsquo;cause      we are serious guys and the team is... most of my team are all ex-NSA,      CIA, DOD, White House, and we&rsquo;re not somebody you&rsquo;d wanta go      picking a fight with.<br><br>      K: OK.<br><br>      G: And I&rsquo;m not somebody you&rsquo;d wanta pick a fight with unless      you got nothing to do for the rest of your life.<br><br>      K: [laughs] OK. Well, I have no desire to pick a fight with you.<br><br>      G: I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m a badass. I&rsquo;m just telling you      that I&rsquo;ve had a lot of experience dealing with gangsters, gang-banksters      and gangsters of every level of society and in our government. And what&rsquo;s      the difference between the Mafia and the government if they&rsquo;re trying      to kill you? None. Nothing. They&rsquo;re all the same. They&rsquo;re all      gangsters. If I had to do a biogaphy today, I&rsquo;d title it <em>Government      by Gangster, my Experiences as a Citizen of the United States of America.</em><br><br>      K: How&rsquo;s your conscience?<br><br>      G: I sleep well. <br><br>      K: You sleep well?<br><br>      G: Yeah. I used to know Paul Tibbets and he bombed Hiroshima and I used      to ask him, I said, how d&rsquo;you sleep? He said, &ldquo;I slept well.&rdquo; He      said, &ldquo;So I killed 200,000 people. So what?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I      stopped the war from killing another 2 million Americans.&rdquo; So...      my conscience... I have no problem with my conscience. I have never done      anything that I am really ashamed of. And notorious or quasi-famous or      interesting fellow, you know, that type of thing. All I&rsquo;ve done is      I was there when the bus went by and the bus of history brought me aboard      and I just took the ride.<br><br>      K: Why do you think you&rsquo;re not actually interviewed all over the      place? &lsquo;Cause you know a hell of a lot.<br><br>      G: Because I avoid it like the plague. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you and I      getting along, I wouldn&rsquo;t do this. And the fact is, I want some fatuous      advantage right now, which is put out enough of this to keep the guys...      Because we&rsquo;re getting really close to snagging the golden ring, you      know, and off the carousel and I would like to stick around a while. And      if you hurt me you&rsquo;re gonna cause a lot of grief and my friends&rsquo;re      gonna be very angry and my friends are gonna be very angry and those little      CD-ROMs are gonna fly all over the planet. And you&rsquo;re not even gonna      be able to protect the revolution if you have the revolution without preconditioning      the situation. You&rsquo;ll have chaos that&rsquo;ll make the crash of &lsquo;29      look like a tea party. So, do they wanta fight? Go ahead. Pick a fight.      You got nothing to do for the rest of your life, go ahead. I&rsquo;m here.      I&rsquo;m easy. I&rsquo;m not hard to find.<br><br>      So the bottom line is that we need to go way beyond the Peace Corps and      we need to form entities within our governments, <em>all</em> governments,      with the prime directive to establish peace on this planet in <em>this</em> decade.<br><br>      K: So you want to put on your sun glasses and... ?<br><br>      G: What for?<br><br>      K: Just to give us the sort of, the incognito...<br><br>      G: Yeah. I&rsquo;m not James Bond. I&rsquo;m, ah... we&rsquo;d like to      think we eat those guys for breakfast. But the bottom line is that we&rsquo;re      just human beings that&rsquo;ve learned how to fight.<br>    </font></p>    <hr>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>      G: I wrote her over... it was right before the first Crash Retrieval Conference      in &rsquo;04. And so I wrote her some letters, some love letters. I thought      I was writing her love letters &lsquo;cause she didn&rsquo;t show up on      time for the Crash Retrieval Conference. And as a result, the... when I      went back to my computer to look at my letters that I wrote her, I <em>could        not believe</em> that I wrote &lsquo;em. OK? Now, what we&rsquo;ve just      discovered, and I can show you the discovery by Kit Green, is that Majestic...      he caught Majestic altering his e-mails. Completely like you would fake      a tape. I had caught &lsquo;em doing&rsquo; that last year when John Lear      and I got into it over Lear threatening my life. OK?<br>      <br>      Bill: How did they alter...<br>      <br>      G: Well, I wrote John an e-mail and the next thing I know, the e-mail is      completely... the e-mail that I wrote is not the e-mail that I wrote! It&rsquo;s      on my computer, but it delays... it doesn&rsquo;t come right back. They      take them.. and they sit there and the remodify &lsquo;em. And I remember      some of the changes. So I call my friends up, and I call up Ron, and I      said <em>Ron, they&rsquo;re actually altering my e-mails!</em> And he says,      I don&rsquo;t know how they can do that. I said well, they&rsquo;re intercepting      them and doing it.<br>      <br>      Bill: Did they do that with the intention of creating conflict?<br>      <br>      G: Oh yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Kit writes a letter saying      don&rsquo;t tell anybody that&rsquo;s fooling with these paradoxes... be      very very careful because they&rsquo;ll create a psychomimetic state akin      to LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin... alter your mindset for a period of      time. We didn&rsquo;t know how long. It lasted about four or five days. &lsquo;Cause      I just wrote a blitz of letters to her and didn&rsquo;t remember writing      them. They, A, must have been on the phone. B, they knew about this paradox      thing from prior work, so they knew when all of the conversations were      going on between me and the university where I was doing &lsquo;em that      they would... ah... they&rsquo;d alter my psychology.<br>      <br>      [Finding document on his laptop.] Here we go. <em>Secret Anthologies of        an American Enigma.</em> Here&rsquo;s my &lsquo;black&rsquo; curriculum      vitae. But it doesn&rsquo;t have the supporting documentation. But if you      will sit down here you can read all about the &lsquo;black&rsquo; side      of me. I&rsquo;ve got a &lsquo;white&rsquo; curriculum vitae too, which      is... but this is my &lsquo;black&rsquo; curriculum vitae which is supported      by nothing but documentation. I have it, but I don&rsquo;t have the documentation      scanned into the computer.<br>      <br>      Bill: And that&rsquo;s absolutely not for the public domain.<br>      <br>      G: Absolutely. This is the truth.<br>      <br>      (reading...) &quot;Mr. Novel was retained as Chief of Security for New Orleans      District Attorney former FBI Agent Jim Garrison&rsquo;s official investigation      into the assassination of President Kennedy. Because of Mr. Novel&rsquo;s      secret relationship with the Johnson White House, he quickly discovered      that the alleged facts of Jim Garrison&rsquo;s official State of Louisiana      [JFK] conspiracy investigation were being entirely woven out of whole cloth.      At the direction of his White House contacts, Mr. Novel secretly supplied      this information to a former high level FBI agent and chief aide to former      Attorney General Robert Kennedy, then working for the NBC White Paper special      news unit. District Attorney Garrison immediately responded by accusing      Mr. Novel of being a CIA agent, calling him &ldquo;the most important material      witness in his alleged conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy&rdquo;.      Mr. Novel had absolutely nothing to do with the President&rsquo;s assassination      and was not then, and never has been, an agent or employee of the CIA.      Until this time in his life, Mr. Novel, like all the rest of us, had believed      that the FBI was the good guys.&quot;</font></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><font color="#FF9900" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="left"><strong>_____________________________</strong></font></blockquote></blockquote><div align="center">     <div align="center"><br><table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                          <!--DWLayoutTable-->                          <tr>                            <td width="350">                          <div align="center">                                  <table width="425" border="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                                    <tr>                                      <td bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>                                          <font color="#990033">Support Project Camelot - make a donation:</font></strong></em></font></p>                                    <div align="center"><a href="https://projectcamelotportal.com/donate.html"><img src="x-click-but21.gif" width="110" height="23" alt="Donate"></a>
