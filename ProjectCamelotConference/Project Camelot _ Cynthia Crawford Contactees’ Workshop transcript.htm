<br><br>


CYNTHIA
CRAWFORD (CC):  This is going to be an exciting time. I also have
some stories to tell you of people who have experienced the Beings
after having a sculpture. Now mind you, I am not allowed to sell the
sculptures.


<br><br>


If
there&rsquo;s something you really want to buy, you may buy it, but I
am not here to sell these, and I&rsquo;ll tell you why I don&rsquo;t
sell these sculptures... I don&rsquo;t talk anybody into buying a
sculpture.

<br><br>


When
I make the sculptures, first of all, they know who&rsquo;s going to
buy them. They need to get into the right hands. They identify with
the right person. If you don&rsquo;t feel a connection, I say do not
buy it; it&rsquo;s not going to serve you at all. Okay?

<br><br>


The
other thing I tell people is you never want to buy a sculpture if
you&rsquo;re afraid to have contact. Okay? If you&rsquo;re afraid to
have contact, don&rsquo;t ever buy a sculpture because when I was in
Alamo, Nevada, doing a conference, a gentleman who had had contact
and never was allowed to remember who he had had contact with decided
he wanted to buy a Mantis Being.


<br><br>


So...
he bought a Mantis Being and lo and behold, a month later he
contacted me and said: <I>I
have been downloaded with visions of what&rsquo;s going to happen in
the future. I&rsquo;ve been given spiritual teachings to help me in
my ascension. But one night I woke up and there were three Beings in
my room!</I>



<br><br>


And
he said: <I>I
didn&rsquo;t expect it and so I told them &ldquo;Get out of here! I
don&rsquo;t want you in here.&rdquo;</I>

<br><br>


And
I said: <I>Oh,
that&rsquo;s too bad. I&rsquo;m really sorry to hear that. Next time
they appear, this is all you have to do. Tell them: &ldquo;You can
talk to me telepathically, but until I&rsquo;m ready to see you and
experience you, please just do it telepathically. Okay?&rdquo;</I>

<br><br>


Let
me tell you a little bit about me, Cynthia Crawford. I was born a
twin. My mother... when I was born, I was born without an amniotic
sac. My twin sister was born with an amniotic sac, but we had totally
different blood types and tissue types.

<br><br>


When
we were five years old, my twin sister never learned to walk like a
normal person. She walked on her tiptoes and fell a lot and the
doctors diagnosed her with Muscular Dystrophy.

<br><br>


My
father, by the way, was in the Army and worked on Top Secret missions
no one was allowed to know about. Okay? I don&rsquo;t know if that
gives you a clue where I&rsquo;m going with this. Okay? This is what
happened.


<br><br>


The
doctors took samples from me because they thought if they
transplanted my muscle tissue in my twin&rsquo;s legs, she might walk
again. They couldn&rsquo;t do the transplant. We were not matches,
even though we were twins. It was as if we were never related.

<br><br>


I
did not find out until I was in my early 30s, when my father came to
me... and my mother and father were divorced when I was quite young<B>,
</B>and
my mother was a very, very devout Christian and my father was an
agnostic.


<br><br>


And
my father came to me and he said: <I>Have
you ever wondered why you&rsquo;ve always had contact with the
Beings? Have you ever wondered why you&rsquo;ve had babies taken from
you by the Beings? </I>Okay?
<I>Have
you ever wondered why you&rsquo;re the only one in the family that&rsquo;s
had communication?</I>

<br><br>


And
I thought: <I>Where
in the world did he get this information? I never told him about
this,</I>
but he knew about it.

<br><br>


I
also as a child who remembered being taken to underground facilities,
government facilities, when I was a toddler, and I would cry because
I didn&rsquo;t want to be there. They would take me to these
underground facilities and they would literally test me to see what
abilities I had.


<br><br>


These
were military doctors and underground facilities many, many, many
floors below the surface, secret facilities. But I was always told
those were dreams, so I thought: <I>Oh,
what horrible dreams.</I>

<br><br>


But
my mother never knew where she was going to find me when I was a
child, if I would be found outside, next to the door inside sleeping
on the floor, or in my bed. And as a teenager, I would sometimes wake
up and I was outside, didn&rsquo;t know how I got there. I also had
times where I thought I was in bed and the next thing I know, I am
floating through the air up into a ship. I used to hate those
&ldquo;dreams&rdquo;.

<br><br>


Well,
now I&rsquo;m in my 30s and my father&rsquo;s telling me this, I
finally said: <I>Why,
Dad? Why have I had contact? Tell me.</I>



<br><br>


And
he said: <I>You&rsquo;re
a hybrid.</I>



<br><br>


I
laughed and I said: <I>No,
no I can&rsquo;t be a hybrid,</I>
because that meant there was a reason why I never felt like I
belonged here.


<br><br>


But,
I also found out at the age of 22, when I had my son and had
complications with him, the doctors could not give me blood
transfusions for I had an antigen in my blood that only two other
people in the whole world had.

<br><br>


Now,
let me tell you, if that doesn&rsquo;t make you feel a little bit
weird, I don&rsquo;t know what does!


<br><br>


AUDIENCE
MEMBER (AM):  [inaudible]


<br><br>


CC:
 No, I don&rsquo;t know them, but I will tell you this, when I had my
son at the age of 22...


<br><br>


I
remember waking up before, of course, and I woke up after being on a
ship and the ship had the ceiling, walls, floors, all seemed to be a
luminous glow to them and I was being told I was going to have a son.
He would do great things in the future to help save the planet Earth.
And I thought: <I>Whoa,
I&rsquo;m going to have a son. He&rsquo;s going to be special.</I>



<br><br>


I
was so excited and I woke up in bed and I&rsquo;m telling my husband.
He goes: <I>Nah,
you&rsquo;re not pregnant. No way.</I>
And I made a bet, and the bet was I would get a sewing machine and by
God that sewing machine came in handy. I made my maternity clothes!
[laughs]

<br><br>


Anyway,
I&rsquo;ve had numerous healings my whole life. When I was 18 years
old... because I always had a hard time fitting in; I used to be a
very depressed child and kept feeling this was not my home. So I did
a very stupid thing and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of people
like me.


<br><br>


I
decided to take an overdose of aspirins and end my life. I was tired
of being on this planet and it was really stupid but I wanted relief.
I wanted relief from the fear of being different, from the &ldquo;dreams&rdquo;
of being in ships. I wanted help, and the way to get help was to die.
Right?


<br><br>


I
took an overdose of aspirins and if anybody knows what happens when
you take a bottle of aspirins, it works like acid in your body and it
completely dissolved my vascular system. I was bleeding out of every
opening in my body. My eyes... I literally went blind. My eyes were
bleeding and I literally got down on my hands and knees, crawled to
the bed, laid down to die. I woke up the next morning healed, one
hundred percent healed.


<br><br>


At
the age of 29 I had real complications with my lungs. I was
constantly getting pneumonia and never knew if I was going to go into
a coma, didn&rsquo;t know why my lungs were so weak. My twin sister
had died just two months before when I came down with lower-lung
pneumonia and both my lungs collapsed while I was out of town. I said
my goodbyes telepathically to God and everybody else.


<br><br>


I
woke up the next morning completely healed, came back to Omaha,
Nebraska, where I was living. The doctor took x-rays of my lungs,
called me in to his office and cried, sat there and literally cried
in front of me, and he said: <I>You
must have something important to do in the future because these are
not your lungs. These are newborn-baby lungs.</I>



<br><br>


I
also was hit by a car in 1993 while I was walking across the
street... thrown
35 feet up into the air, 75 feet out into another street. All these
bones in here were broken, had gone in and out my bladder. My colon
and intestines were all twisted and knotted up. A part of my face was
torn off me. My ears were torn off me. I wear a plate in my shoulder.



<br><br>


I
was told that it would take six to eight months for me to walk
again, but because my muscle tissue is Anunnaki, I walked in two
months. But because my bones are Zeta bones, from my DNA, my bones
did not heal like humans. My bones took three times longer than a
human. I have both Zeta DNA, Anunnaki DNA, and human DNA.

<br><br>


Anunnaki
is the greatest part of my DNA which attributes for my muscular
build. When I did one time in my life start working out with weights,
I developed the body of a weight lifter that would take one to two
years to develop that body, I did it in two weeks. Unbelievable. One
day I looked in the mirror and go: <I>I&rsquo;m
a man!</I>
I was so muscular. So I quit working out. [laughs]

<br><br>


But
anyway, it was not until after... When I had that accident, by the
way, it took me five years to say complete sentences and to remember
one minute to the next. I had lost 1/3 of my brain and I had to learn
all over again. It&rsquo;s quite an experience, a very humbling
experience.

<br><br>
In 1997 I decided to give up my fear of having contact and I started going to an experiencer group and I gave up my fear and I started having contact at least one to two times a week and I began going to other planets. I began going through teachings, spiritual teachings, which I didn't expect -spiritual teachings of love.[Ed note: Text of this paragraph altered at the request of Cynthia Crawford, March 2010, to correct information mistakenly given by Cynthia in her conference presentation.]<br>
<br>


I
started working with this group of experiencers and I gave up my fear
and I started having contact at least one to two times a week and I
began going to other planets. I began going through teachings,
spiritual teachings, which I didn&rsquo;t expect &ndash; spiritual
teachings of love.


<br><br>


One
of the first things they told me was: <I>In
order to be in the new world which will be coming soon, humans must
give up greed, judgment, and prejudice by looking beyond the physical
container to see the Creator-Source within each and every Being...
Not within each and every human &ndash; each and every Being. </I>Okay?



<br><br>


Now,
when I gave up my fear I said: <I>Okay,
by golly, I want them to come to me now. I want them to tell me: Why
was I the victim? Why did they want me? Why were they always taking
me away? Why did they take my babies from time to time?</I>



<br><br>


I
had three conscious memories of having babies taken from me and I
found out I have 23 children on other planets. Part of it&rsquo;s my
DNA.


<br><br>


Doctors
couldn&rsquo;t explain why, when at the age of 24 I had to have a
hysterectomy, why my tubes... and when I was 40 years old and they
removed my tubes and ovaries, why my tubes were like plump hotdogs
ready for a weenie roast. The truth was, they told me, that a panel
of doctors had examined the tissue and it was perfectly healthy.


<br><br>


I
had not one, not two, not three tubal pregnancies, but at least four
or more. I only remember one because I remember waking up and having
a lot of complications with that tubal pregnancy that they <I>took</I>,
and then I found that they used my eggs. What it had to do with was
my DNA; that&rsquo;s why they wanted me.




So
anyway, getting back to when I gave up fear of having contact with
them and said: <I>I&rsquo;m
ready for conscious...</I>
After three weeks of begging they finally appeared to me and the
first one that appeared to me was one of the most incredible loving
Beings I had ever, ever encountered, and the love was beyond words.
There is no human description for the love they give you. Okay?


<br><br>


What
happened was, on the day that he materialized, I&rsquo;m laying in
bed begging, of course, and here comes... almost like <I>Star
Trek</I>...
here comes a body materializing in front of me, brown skin as
wrinkled as elephant skin, very glove-leather soft. I don&rsquo;t
know what kind of lotion he used, but he was soft.


<br><br>


He
had a large head which was large here, dented in the back here, and
then went out a little bit again and then to a long thin neck; long
arms, arms longer than humans; very muscular lean body; gold eyes
with slits, and he humbly looked down for fear he would frighten me.


<br><br>


All
I felt was the most incredible love coming from him. It was as if God
himself had entered my room, and I had no idea I could feel this kind
of love. I had never felt it from anyone and I said to him: <I>May
I hold your hand?</I>
And he rolled out three long fingers with suction cups on the ends.

<br><br>


Is
there anyone in this room who has woken up with these bruises, three
bruises on their thighs, legs, or somewhere? You have? And they look
almost like a suction cup type bruise? [audience member responds,
inaudible] On your shoulder? Okay.


<br><br>


Do
you know why we wake up with these bruises? It is not because we&rsquo;ve
been hurt, it is because consciously it is to alert us or let us know
we have had contact. Whatever happened, it is for us to remember it.
Okay?

<br><br>


So
this guy shows me the suction cups on the ends of his fingers and I&rsquo;m
holding his hand like... Oh, was that cool, almost like first love!
It was wonderful and I would do it again and again and again. But
after a while he said: <I>Now
it&rsquo;s time for you to learn from someone else</I>,
so I started going from Being to Being to Being and eventually began
having contact with The Masters.

<br><br>


The
Masters are not the people that tell you what to do and to worship
them. The Masters are here to tell us who we are, how important we
are, all equal. There is no greater than and lesser than another.
Sananda, Ashtar, Mary &ndash; all of them are Beings.


<br><br>


Now,
let&rsquo;s fast-forward a little bit and in 2003 one day while
taking a pot-throwing class, trying to learn how to use clay, they
were overbooked and they didn&rsquo;t have enough wheels and so I sat
there most of the time just kind of waiting my turn and I started
working with the clay and the next thing I knew I had sculptured an
ET baby hybrid.

<br><br>


Let
me tell you, the people in this class were not open-minded like you
guys. They thought it was freaky, creepy, and some of the people even
told the teacher: <I>Do
you mind if you tell her not to make these in this room? </I>


<br><br>


So
I would make them in my home and I began having conscious contact
with these Beings where they were telepathically... I would be
sculpturing and they would tell me how to make the eyes, the nose,
the head. By the way, one time I made the nose too big and they said
[pitches voice low and masculine]: <I>He
does not have a Bob Hope nose.</I>
[laughs] Ooo!


<br><br>


Or
they would say: <I>The
eyes do not bulge that much.</I>
Okay. Or: <I>The
eyes are more slanted.</I>

<br><br>


What
I didn&rsquo;t realize right off the bat... They did tell me
telepathically: <I>When
you make these Beings, they carry our frequency.</I>
I was only allowed to make Beings that work with the Light.


<br><br>


One
time I decided I wanted to make a reptilian but not the good
reptilians. You know, there are good and there are bad, and there&rsquo;s
nothing wrong with the bad, truly. The bad ones are just as important
as the good ones because how do we know what love is if we haven&rsquo;t
experienced what hate is? Or what pain is if we haven&rsquo;t
experienced not being in pain? Believe me, when you have a lot of
broken bones, you know what pain is. [laughs]

<br><br>


So,
we learn through experiencing the differences.


<br><br>


They
would never allow me to make negative ones and one day I saw this
picture of a reptilian that people said &ldquo;Raped Women. Bad
Reptilian&rdquo;. I thought: <I>Well
he&rsquo;s awfully pretty. I think I&rsquo;ll make him anyway.</I>



<br><br>


I
STARTED MAKING HIM, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE BEINGS SAID TO ME:  <I>No.
WE don&rsquo;t want you to do that one.</I>

<br><br>


I
SAID: <I>But</I>
<I>I
want to.</I>



<br><br>


THEY
SAID: <I>WE
do not want you to</I>.
Now, they speak in a collective, by the way.

<br><br>


I
SAID: <I>I
don&rsquo;t care what WE want, I want to find out if I&rsquo;m an
artist because I don&rsquo;t make these by myself. You work through
me to make these sculptures. I want to find out if I even have any
artistic talent.</I>



<br><br>


So
they shut their mouths and I made a reptilian. He was gorgeous, and
he was perfect, and I was so proud. I pushed him off into the middle
of this big, big six-foot-long island, grabbed some more clay and
started making another sculpture, and the next thing I know, the
sculpture goes flying off of the counter, smashed face down,
unrecognizable, and the message was: <I>That
which you make, you bring that frequency into the world.</I>

<br><br>


<I>Okay.
I got it... only benevolent Beings.</I>

<br><br>


Now,
what I want you to do, because when they told me their frequency is
in these Beings, these sculptures, they told me... in fact they even
called me a &ldquo;straw,&rdquo; I am a straw through which the fluid
flows, so when I do hands-on, they come through me and whatever
sculpture I&rsquo;m making, they put their frequency in them and the
longer I work on them, the more empowered they are.


<br><br>


For
an example, one time... actually this last February when I was in
Laughlin... Anybody go to Laughlin? Okay, good, a few of you guys
went to Laughlin to the International UFO Congress.


<br><br>


I
got home at midnight and I was so tired. I rode with another person,
or I had another person ride with me... we were getting things out
and he wasn&rsquo;t paying attention and one of the sculptures, a
Zeta, kind of a green looking Zeta, fell out of my car and broke.

<br><br>


And
so I thought: <I>Oh
darn, I have to fix it.</I>
Well, it took me an hour and a half to fix it and I had to hold the
head onto the neck and then I had to rebuild the neck and
blah-blah-blah.


<br><br>


<I>A
Paranormal Matrix</I>
came out to my house to film me making sculptures and to show
pictures of all my sculptures... And by the way, this is going to be
on TV. I haven&rsquo;t yet got a date for the release, but they will
be showing this on TV. As they&rsquo;re filming all the sculptures,
all of a sudden they came to the one that had broken that I had
repaired.


<br><br>


Because
I put in extra time repairing it, it had so much frequency their
camera, which had a stabilizer in it, went <I>nuts</I>.
It was vibrating... [makes noise like a Theremin] And let me tell
you, everyone there but one man who was an agnostic, everyone there,
there was eight crew people filming this, were &ldquo;believers&rdquo;.
They had never seen anything like this, ever.


<br><br>


I&rsquo;ve
had people take dowsing rods and literally set a sculpture down and
take a dowsing rod and go right up to the sculpture and when they get
from 10
to
15 feet... if it&rsquo;s a sculpture that was broke that I had to
repair, they get 20 feet away and those rods would open wide up
because of the kind of frequency they have.

<br><br>


I
thought they were joking when somebody told me that they used dowsing
rods on it, so I started doing it (and I&rsquo;ll be darned if I
didn&rsquo;t forget my dowsing rods), but they open up, wide up. I
was just absolutely blown away and going: <I>Whoa,
that&rsquo;s okay. That&rsquo;s cool.</I>

<br><br>

<font color="#990033"><strong><em>Meditation Exercise:</em></strong></font>

<br><br>


Now,
those who have sculptures, what I want you to do, first of all I want
everyone, I want you to relax, take deep breaths, big,
big
deep breaths. Just totally relax and allow yourselves to be One. And
then I want you to, as you&rsquo;re holding the sculptures, or if you
have a necklace, hold the necklace and imagine that piece as if it&rsquo;s
an extension of your arms and hold it. Allow it to become part of
you.

<br><br>


Allow
yourself to feel the energy. Feel the energy. You may feel tingling.
You may feel pulsing. It may even speak to you. Don&rsquo;t be
surprised if it&rsquo;s telepathically speaking to you. Feel the
energy of
them.
And while you&rsquo;re doing that I&rsquo;m going to tell you a
little story.

<br><br>


Last
May, a year ago May, when I was doing a conference in Alamo, Nevada,
the day before I left to do the conference, I was told to sit down at
the computer and to write. And all of a sudden this was what came
out:

<br><br>


<I>The
Source </I><I>was,</I><I>
just </I><I>was</I><I>
All That Is. The Source knew all, was all. And the Source decided
that it wanted to know what it was like not to be all, not to know
all. So the Source made Selves and the Source made worlds for Selves
to live on, and each Self would have a container that it would be
allowed, to live on these planets. Source Selves are the Light, the
Soul-Light connected to the Source. </I>


<br><br>


I
don&rsquo;t have time to do a regression tonight but I will tell you
this that I did a regression with these people. I took them down and
I took them to another planet and I started introducing, one by one,
each of the Beings to them. Then I took them from the planet and the
planet disappeared, and all of the Beings throughout the universe
that I had introduced them to, they all were holding hands. Then all
of a sudden I had their bodies, their containers disappear, and all
that was left was their Source, their Source-Light, the Soul within.

<br><br>


Now
imagine a circle of lights. Now imagine off in the distance in outer
space comes a big, big bright light and it&rsquo;s moving quickly
through the universe and it comes down in the center of all these
little Light Beings. The Big Light is the Source-Creator,
the Source itself, All That Is. And all the little lights that
represent the Souls of the Beings throughout the universe are all
Source-Selves and the Light expels umbilical cords that goes out to
each and every light so it looks almost like a wheel with the spokes
in the middle.


<br><br>


We
are all connected to those of the universe and you have contact with
them. It&rsquo;s simply by releasing the container, going within,
connecting with the Source, the Creator of all, and opening up your
heart to communicate with your brothers and sisters throughout the
universe.

<br><br>


We
are all here for our lessons. We can be teachers to one another and
we can be soul brothers and sisters and share our lessons, but in
every lifetime we have a certain set of lessons that allows us to
grow spiritually, and that&rsquo;s what life is about. We are on this
planet, Earth, at this time, one of the most precious times ever in
which we actually get to experience the release of an old world and
the bringing in of a new world.

<br><br>


And
we get to be those people who start the new world over. That what
we
want to see in the new world is that which we need to be now. When we
begin living what we want to see in the world, we change the world.

<br><br>


Now
I want you to feel the energy inside these sculptures and let the
feeling of that energy move into your heart chakra. Connect with it.
They&rsquo;re asking you to feel their love. Allow that love to
penetrate your heart and exchange love with them. Give the love back.
Give them love.

<br><br>


[several
moments of silence; meditation ends]

<br><br>


When
you go home at night or even tonight here if you&rsquo;re staying at
the hotel, close your eyes and meditate and do this. Connect with the
Source, connect with the Beings and say: <I>I
am no longer afraid. My heart is open. I am ready for contact.</I>



<br><br>


The
only thing you need to know that&rsquo;s going to help you through
anything and everything in this world that we will face, or are about
to face, is unconditional love and living the Light.

<br><br>


If
you think there&rsquo;s a chance that somebody may be of a negative
energy, you can dissipate any negativity simply by enveloping them in
the Light and sending them unconditional love.


<br><br>


I
have been attacked many times by the Illuminati and by the
government, the secret government, who because I know who I am and
have spoken up about how we&rsquo;re all connected; they have tried
to take me out.


<br><br>


There
literally have been times the Illuminati have actually tried to take
me out by causing me to... One time I woke up after being drugged by
them and they had injected me with a serum that caused an aneurism in
my brain, but right before my brain was to pop, all of a sudden I
cried out for my guides, for my Beings, and said: <I>If
you want me to finish my mission, then heal me!</I>
Instantly I was out cold and an hour later I woke up &ndash; I was
completely healed.


<br><br>


Anyone
that does anything negative to you, if you return negativity with
negativity, anger, hatred, resentment, any of these things, this is
what&rsquo;s gonna happen, you&rsquo;re going to empower them. Why
not keep your power? We can empower ourselves with unconditional love
and enveloping the Light around all those people that we want to
either to teach to empower themselves or that we want to diffuse them
of their negativity.

<br><br>


I
had a friend that told me that when she stayed over at my house one
time, she woke up in the middle of the night and there was a
reptilian carrying me &ndash; I was out cold &ndash; carrying me
away.


<br><br>


SHE
WALKED UP TO HIM AND HE WAS A BIG ONE AND SHE SAID TO HIM:  <I>Put
her down now!</I>



<br><br>


AND
THE BEING TELEPATHICALLY SAID:  <I>What
are you gonna do about it?</I>



<br><br>


AND
SHE SAID:  <I>I&rsquo;m
going to love you</I>,
and immediately he put me down.


<br><br>


Darkness
cannot handle the Light. Let&rsquo;s be in the Light and let&rsquo;s
change this world. Let&rsquo;s take our power back.


<br><br>


You
want to take your power back? Everybody want to take your power back?
Let&rsquo;s do it now. Let&rsquo;s do it now. How many of you would
like to have contact? [hands raised] All right! That&rsquo;s
wonderful. I&rsquo;m so happy.

<br><br>


Call
them to you. Open your hearts to them.  Give them love. They may not
do it the same moment you do that. It took me three weeks of begging,
but then it&rsquo;s like I have contact all the time. Sometimes we
have to beg a little and sometimes we just have to be patient, but
never stop giving them love, for when they feel your love they say:
<I>Okay.
They&rsquo;re ready.</I>

<br><br>


Okay.
Oh boy. Okay. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m seeing this correct.
What time do you guys have? Okay, I guess we&rsquo;ve got a little
bit more time.

<br><br>


I
want to ask... [music starts playing... she laughs]


<br><br>


AUDIENCE
MEMBER (AM):  [inaudible]


<br><br>


CC:
 You did? What colors did you see?

<br><br>


AM:
 There was a deep purple alternating with almost like a tan, and then
it went white.


<br><br>


CC:
 [inaudible]


<br><br>


AM:
 Just with my eyes closed.


<br><br>


CC:
 [inaudible]


<br><br>


AM:
 Oh yeah. I&rsquo;ve been holding it for...


<br><br>


CC:
 Did you feel anything? Did you feel any vibration or anything?

<br><br>


AM:
 I didn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t. And then it went completely black...
and one my challenges, I can never make a black screen, but this was
a completely black screen, you know, like your blouse or my shirt,
and then white came back again.

<br><br>


AMs
&ndash; SEVERAL VOICES:  [inaudible]


<br><br>


CC:
 Okay. Let&rsquo;s see, lavender was your first?


<br><br>


AMs
&ndash; SEVERAL VOICES:  [inaudible]


<br><br>


CC:
 Okay. Lavender represents your spiritual self.


<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]


<br><br>


CC:
 You&rsquo;re talking about the third chakra?


<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]


<br><br>


CC:
 Yes. Yes, it is but it also represents wisdom. You&rsquo;re being
downloaded with some wisdom. And what were the other colors?


<br><br>


AM:
 White.

<br><br>


CC:
 White is the highest color of ascension. Anybody have any
experiences while holding the sculptures? Okay. What was your
experience?


<br><br>


AM:
 I was meditating, I felt like pulsating in my head, vibration, just
a vibration in my head, right
here.
It was like pulsating.

<br><br>


CC:
 Okay, who else felt it?

<br><br>


AM:
 And light.

<br><br>


CC:
 And light? All right! Anybody else?


<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]
Violet
and bluish.

<br><br>


CC:
 Violet
and bluish.

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]&hellip; and vibration.

<br><br>


CC:
 Vibration.



<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 Excellent.
Oh good! I get a lot of people tell me they start feeling vibration.
I sent sculptures to two different women who had experienced a
<I>Nefilim</I>
[This is how she spells it on her website] <I>Child</I>
and
both of them, when they picked the packages out of their post box...
[low electronic vibration sound, rising in pitch at the end]... it
vibrated, like that. [laughs]


<br><br>


CC:
 Yes.
And you?

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]


<br><br>


CC:
 Pulsation.
That&rsquo;s common.

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]


<br><br>


CC:
 Ooooh,
Wow. Communication there! She felt like she wanted to cry. Wow.
That&rsquo;s beautiful.


<br><br>


That
particular one is the <I>Anabua</I>.
The Anabua have cried for the planet Earth because of the abuse that
humanity has created, so the Anabua are all about Nature. They&rsquo;ve
agreed at this time at the end of the old world, to come here to
actually give us... they&rsquo;re going to check out... As we are
moving into Stargates and so forth, they are here as well to watch
the way, to let us know if there&rsquo;s any danger ahead and so
forth. Anybody else? Yes.


<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 Oh
good. She had a broken hip at one time that you&rsquo;ve had surgery
on. Is that right? And she felt a healing ache.


<br><br>


Now
I will say this, a few people have actually experienced healing.
There is a woman who recently was given a sculpture, it was the
<I>Andromedan
Child</I>,
and what happened with the Andromedan Child, she now uses it... she&rsquo;s
a Reiki master? Actually it opens up peoples&rsquo; chakras and has
dispersed all negative energy, anything attaching to people.


<br><br>


I
receive emails from a lot of people who have experiences.

<br><br>


It
looks like we&rsquo;re going to have to end this. I really apologize.
I was really hoping we could have a much longer time. Maybe I can
find a time tomorrow if Kerry and Bill, you know, are able to fit me
in, where we can sit down and talk some more because it&rsquo;s...


<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 Yeah,
maybe during lunch break. I&rsquo;m not sure if they&rsquo;re going
to do that other thing at lunchtime, but I&rsquo;ll talk to them.


<br><br>


The
thing we need to be cognizant of... [to audience member] Pardon?

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 Yeah.
The thing we need to be cognizant of... we need to just relax, to
stop judging, and start loving. We need to be cognizant that we&rsquo;re
all connected to the universe. We take our turn from planet to
planet, learning the lessons we&rsquo;ve chosen. What it all boils
down to is when we leave our physical container, we get to go back to
the spiritual plane and communicate with one another the lessons
we&rsquo;ve learned.


<br><br>


When
I gave up my fear and learned to love these Beings, oh my gosh, I
can&rsquo;t get enough love. It&rsquo;s like sometimes it&rsquo;s
hard being in my body! [laughs] It&rsquo;s <I>wonderful</I>.

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 Oh
no, I&rsquo;m allowed to sell them. I&rsquo;m not allowed to talk
people into buying them. You may buy them. If you&rsquo;re really
connected to one and you feel drawn to it, you may buy it. But what
I&rsquo;m saying is I cannot talk anybody into ever buying one for
they know who their owner is and you will know.


<br><br>


I&rsquo;ve
had people walk past my booth when I&rsquo;ve been at shows and
they&rsquo;ve turned around and they&rsquo;d go: <I>I&rsquo;m
sorry. What</I>?



<br><br>


I&rsquo;LL
LOOK AT THEM AND GO:  <I>I
didn&rsquo;t say anything.</I>



<br><br>


AND
THEY GO: <I>Ohhh...
your sculpture&rsquo;s talking to me</I>.



<br><br>


I&rsquo;ve
had people actually see the sculpture... and you have to be very
open-minded and not afraid. They&rsquo;ve actually seen for example,
Mary...
I
mean, call her &ldquo;Mary&rdquo;; she&rsquo;s the Blue Lady, the
plaque of the Blue Lady
&ndash; she
carries the Mary energy and Isis energy.


<br><br>


I&rsquo;ve
had people tell me that the plaque actually became an entire tall
Being and actually came to her the night she got it. Then it came
back a second time that night and brought two other Beings from other
planets and said: <I>Well,
if you&rsquo;re open enough for me, here&rsquo;s some others that
would like to meet you.</I>

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 That
is a <I>Tall
White</I>.
Charles Hall wrote books, the <I>Millennium</I>
series [<I>Millennium
Hospitality</I>,
a trilogy], about his experience while in the Air Force meeting with
Tall Whites? They literally have come to this planet numerous times,
they have for hundreds and hundreds of years. Actually, many of them
still live here. [to audience member] Yes?

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


I
overcame my fear when I got doggone tired of being a victim, when I
said: <I>I
am so tired of them coming and getting me when I don&rsquo;t want
them to and when I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing... they
won&rsquo;t let me remember.</I>



<br><br>


And
finally I said: <I>I&rsquo;m
going to find out and the only way I can find out is to give up my
fear and say: &ldquo;Okay guys, why me?&rdquo;</I>
And they came to me, finally, after three weeks of begging. And I&rsquo;ll
tell you what, after I started experiencing them... I don&rsquo;t
care.


<br><br>


They
come to me a lot. I&rsquo;ve even... Does anybody have the <I>Ant
People</I>
plaque? Anybody took the Ant People plaque?

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 Ah
yes! Let me tell you the story about the Ant People. I did not
believe that the old world was going to end and there was going to be
a new world. I kept thinking: <I>Enh..</I>.[makes
sound of skepticism] you know.<I>
</I>I&rsquo;d
heard about what happens in 2000 and so forth.<I>
</I>


<br><br>


So
in 2006 one night I woke up in the middle of the night, potty break
time, and got up to go to the bathroom, and I noticed that there was
an Ant <I>person</I>
about five feet tall standing beside my bed. As I looked around,
there was another one by the fireplace, and another one by the
stereo. And I&rsquo;m going: <I>Whoa,
what a dream. I can&rsquo;t... this isn&rsquo;t real.</I>



<br><br>


I
got up to go to the bathroom and I put cold water on my face, slapped
myself a few times, almost slapped myself silly, and I came out and I
said: <I>Okay,
if they&rsquo;re real, they&rsquo;re going to be there when I come
back.</I>



<br><br>


I
came back and, by God, they were real! I didn&rsquo;t know who in the
world they were so I sculptured them. Anybody know of Chris O&rsquo;Brien?

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 Yes.
Chris O&rsquo;Brien, <I>The
Mysterious Valley</I>
and so forth? He&rsquo;d spent... I think it was six years living
with the Hopi? Interestingly enough about Chris O&rsquo;Brien, I will
tell you, he thought I was a phony. When he saw all the sculptures I
did, he said:<I>
You can&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve had experience with these
Beings. I won&rsquo;t believe you. </I>


<br><br>


And
when I pulled out the Ant People sculpture (I actually made an entire
sculpture), he goes: <I>Oh
my God! The Ant People.</I>



<br><br>


I
SAID:  <I>The
what?</I>



<br><br>


HE
GOES:  <I>The
Ant People.</I>



<br><br>


AND
I SAID:  <I>Who
are they? </I>


<br><br>


HE
GOES:  <I>Well,
look it up,</I>
and he gives me this website to go to, and I read [about] the Hopi
talking about the Ant People.


<br><br>


So
when I came back from that seminar I meditated one night and I said:
<I>Okay,
I&rsquo;ve very open-minded. I would like to go down into the inner
world, inner Earth, to their den and see what their den looks like.</I>



<br><br>


And
oh my God, what a joy! They literally have claws kind of like crab
claws on their feet and hands, and they have antennas. Now, anybody
know why the antennas, why they have antennas?

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 No,
they have these antennas... Do you remember <I>My
Favorite Martian?</I>
Are you old enough for that? [laughs]


<br><br>


Well,
what I didn&rsquo;t realize was the antennas were because they pick
up <I>frequency</I>.
They know us not by our face nor by our name, but by our frequency.


<br><br>


My
Beings told me our soul... when we were created, our soul has a
frequency that is our identity we carry. No matter how many
lifetimes, no matter what planet we live on, we always carry that
frequency. They can find us whenever they need us. They zoom in on
us.


<br><br>


And
what happens is, the frequency intensifies as we become more and more
spiritual. Okay? It&rsquo;s wonderful.

<br><br>


The
Ant People... their only purpose is to bring us to inner Earth when
those who are meant to start the new world over again, after Mother
Earth has shaken herself free of &ldquo;the fleas&rdquo;...

<br><br>


I
actually had a communication once with Mother Earth, and I thought:
<I>Whoa,
now this is really pushing the button there</I><I>!
</I>I
had no idea Mother Earth was a sentient Being.


<br><br>


All
of a sudden she wakes me up in the middle of the night and she says:
<I>I
have to cleanse myself, for humanity has been very angry, very
negative, very hateful, very greedy and jealous.</I>

<br><br>


Although
many of you are ready to graduate... We&rsquo;re going through a
graduation for spiritual Beings
&ndash; we&rsquo;re
going to graduate from the lower density. So she said during this
graduation she must shake herself clean of all this negativity and
there will be a new group of students coming to Earth. Many of us
have chosen to go to the new world and start the world over.


<br><br>


Some
will go back to the ships where they came from, others will go back
to other planets, and some might just be Guides for others. You know,
as we have Guides that speak to us? We may choose just to kind of
relax, hang back, and just be a Guide and talk to people
telepathically [laughs] like I&rsquo;ve had the fortune of having.

<br><br>


So,
any other questions? [to audience member] Yes?

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 She
wants to know if it&rsquo;s true about the ascension, and will Earth
go into a fourth or fifth density?


<br><br>


You
know, your truth is there in your heart, but I&rsquo;m going to tell
you what they told me and then I&rsquo;m going to tell each and every
one of you, if you want to know the truth, connect to the Source
within, for your truth belongs to you. No matter what anyone says or
no matter what you read, your truth is yours. Okay? We only share
what we think is our truth. Okay?

<br><br>


What
they told me... and what was interesting is I was driving one evening
or afternoon with John Mack&rsquo;s assistant, Maria, and I was
explaining the new Earth. I was told that, as an atom splits, so too
will planet Earth split and become two worlds.


<br><br>


At
the moment that I told her this, a rock dropped from a truck and hit
my windshield and I had two big overlapping round holes in my
windshield. Isn&rsquo;t it an expensive lesson? But it got the point
across. She understood then, but it showed the two Earths splitting.
I have a photograph of this. I thought it was worth photographing.


<br><br>


But
what I was told was that Earth will always be a third-dimensional
planet, but there is a new Earth that will be a higher density planet
where those who have already learned their lessons and have graduated
can go and start the world over with higher-conscious Beings.


<br><br>


The
other Earth is always there as a school for the new class of people,
of Beings coming in, that are ready for their lessons. So it&rsquo;s
kind of like being in school.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s
kind of like we&rsquo;re going to graduate high school this year...
or this lifetime, excuse me... this lifetime. It might be this year!
Who knows? [laughs] 2012 may come sooner than we think. So that&rsquo;s
what I understand is going to happen.

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>


CC:
 In
a higher dimension. He asked where the new Earth, the higher-density
Earth, will be. It&rsquo;s going to be in a higher dimension. What we
don&rsquo;t understand because we&rsquo;re living in a
third-dimensional world... we have to learn to see outsight the box.
The new Earth is in a much higher dimension than we are now.

<br><br>


AM:
 [inaudible]


CC:
 Yes.
We just have to open our minds and to accept whatever they&rsquo;re
willing to teach us about this. Every time I think I know it all
[laughs] I find out how much more I need to learn. So I say: reach
inside your hearts, connect with the Source, and your answers will be
there.

<br><br>


If
you guys have any questions for me, feel free at any time to come up
to my booth and ask them. I&rsquo;m going to call it quits now so we
don&rsquo;t interfere any more with the music that&rsquo;s going to
be performing here. So I hope you all enjoy the evening. Thank you so
much!
