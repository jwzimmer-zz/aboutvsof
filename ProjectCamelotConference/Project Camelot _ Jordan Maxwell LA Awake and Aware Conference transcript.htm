KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  &hellip;the trail of the truth for over forty years.
If anything, he&rsquo;s probably <I>the</I>
expert. He has spawned most of the researchers you know such as
Zecharia Sitchin and David Icke and so on. He brought them to the
public.
<br><br>

Jordan
has not been credited in half the way that he should be [applause]
and I want to do that right here. [applause]
<br><br>

He&rsquo;s
given some of our lead researchers some information and they&rsquo;ve
never credited him &ndash; okay? &ndash; so you may think it comes
from them and that they are so smart and brilliant. Believe me, they
wouldn&rsquo;t be half the place they are today if it wasn&rsquo;t
for Jordan Maxwell.
<br><br>

And
so we really want to honor him here today and we&rsquo;re very proud
to have him speak at a Project Camelot conference.

JORDAN
MAXWELL (JM):  Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause/ whistles]
<br><br>

I
think the one thing I&rsquo;d like for you to take away from anything
that I say today is this one point: that nothing in this world works
the way you think it does. <I>Nothing</I>.
<br><br>

The
police aren&rsquo;t who you think they are; the sheriff is not who
you think he is; banks do not do what you think they do; governments
don&rsquo;t operate anywhere near the way you think they do, and
that&rsquo;s why today, when you look at what&rsquo;s going on in the
world today, none of it makes any sense. It&rsquo;s all crazy. It
makes no sense at all.
<br><br>

It
seems very destructive, but actually in point of fact, you don&rsquo;t
know how the system works. It&rsquo;s working perfectly fine!
<br><br>

The
rich get richer and the poor get poorer; the people, the masses, are
entertained with television and alcohol and drugs and the wealthy
continue to get wealthy. And so, it&rsquo;s working perfectly fine
once you understand how the world really works and nothing works the
way you think it does.
<br><br>

My
whole life I have been interested in theology and religion, and
that&rsquo;s my real love. I&rsquo;ve spent all of my awakened hours
of research throughout the country and throughout the world studying
theology and religion -- but not to learn <I>from</I>
it, but to learn <I>about</I>
it.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
a fascinating story once you see how our religions came into being.
You begin to see things that you&rsquo;ve never seen before and begin
to have questions that never occurred to you before.
<br><br>

So,
that&rsquo;s been my major love. But I also in the early &rsquo;80s,
very early &rsquo;80s, came into contact with some people who were
experts&rsquo; experts on government and banking, and I was in their
company for many years. I learned how governments work, and it was
absolutely astounding to me to see the real truth.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
taken me 48 years to get here tonight, but I&rsquo;m going to give
you a secret that I&rsquo;ve learned. I&rsquo;m going to give this to
you for free.

<br><br>

This
is a secret and it&rsquo;s a very powerful secret: <I>Financially,
and in every other way, people will always support what they want to
hear. They will not support what they don&rsquo;t want</I>
to hear.

<br><br>

If
you like country music, you&rsquo;re not going to pay thirty bucks
for a rap concert. If you like a particular movie star, you&rsquo;re
not going to go see somebody else. People will always... I mean if
you like a particular kind of food, you&rsquo;re not going to the
opposite restaurant.
<br><br>

So
people will always support what they want to hear. Anyone who has
traveled and dealt with the public, you will find that the one thing
that people, generally speaking, do not want to hear is the truth.
Nobody is happy when they have to be faced with the truth.

<br><br>

There
are some brave people, like maybe you here today, who are at least
open to hear something that may conflict with what you believe or
what you know, but at least you are truth-seekers.
<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
what I have always been, is a truth-seeker.

<br><br>

I
always say I&rsquo;m not the world&rsquo;s foremost authority on
anything, because I&rsquo;m at least smart enough to know how much I
don&rsquo;t know, but when you begin to break down how government
works, banks work, you begin to see a whole world that you&rsquo;ve
never known.

<br><br>

The
word I use is <I>occult</I>.
<I>Occult</I>
simply means <I>hidden,</I>
and this is exactly what is going on in the world today. Our
governments, banks, institutions of education, etcetera, are
operating on a totally occult or hidden basis, and so what we are
told and given to understand is not the truth.
<br><br>

Let
me give you an example. How many people have heard me lecture or talk
about the maritime system of commerce? Okay, so most people at least
have heard about the subject.

<br><br>

For
those of you who haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll just give you some
examples.
<br><br>

When
you go into court, why do you have to go to <I>court</I>?
You play tennis on a <I>court</I>.
You play basketball on a <I>court</I>.
The whole idea in a court is to put the ball back in the other guy&rsquo;s
court. So you have a team of lawyers and they throw the ball back in
another guy&rsquo;s court, and that team throws the ball back in the
other guy&rsquo;s court, and the judge is a referee, and he doesn&rsquo;t
care who wins or loses. He&rsquo;s going to get paid anyway.
<br><br>

So
he wears a black robe. Black robes... most people never question why
do Catholic priests wear black robes? Kids that graduate from high
school wear black robes; judges wear black robes; rabbis wear black
robes &ndash; because black robes represent the planet Saturn. They
are a symbol for the planet Saturn.

<br><br>

Saturn
was called by the ancient people &ldquo;Lord of the Rings&rdquo; and
Saturn is Lord of the Rings.
<br><br>

This
is why women were told in the ancient world to listen to their god
and the concept was that they would wear an ear-<I>ring</I>.
<br><br>

Men
were to get married before their god, so they wear wedding <I>rings</I>,
because the old ancient god of the Middle East, one of the ancient
gods of the Middle East, was the planet Saturn. Saturn was directly
connected to Yahweh, the Hebrew god, so this is why even today the
Jews celebrate the worship of Saturn.

<br><br>

Saturn
in the old Phoenician language was called <I>Shabath</I>.
Look up in the Phoenician language, you will find that the planet
Saturn was called <I>Shabath</I>
and his worship to honor him once a week was called <I>Sabbath</I>.
So when the Jews are having <I>Sabbath,</I>
they&rsquo;re actually paying homage to their god, Saturn, Lord of
the Rings.
<br><br>

So
when you start breaking down where religions have come from,
theologies have come from...

<br><br>

The
six-pointed star, for instance, is called the Star of<I>
David.</I> Actually it&rsquo;s
not the Star of David. All the encyclopedias and reference works will
tell you that it&rsquo;s called the star of <I>Saturn</I>.
It is a hexagram. Hexagrams represented the planet Saturn.

<br><br>

Then
when you look at the Christian system of things... the church is a
disgrace in my opinion. Period. The Christian church is a disgrace.
Everything that comes out of the Christian church in America is a
disgrace. It&rsquo;s filled with lies, deception, innuendos. It is a
money-making corporation that operates under maritime admiralty law,
and there is a whole world of knowledge that Christians have not been
given about the scriptures, about who wrote the Bible, where it came
from.
<br><br>

I
have found that even Judaism is not a B.C.
[Ed
note: &ldquo;Before Christ&rdquo; &ndash; now designated as B.C.E. or
&ldquo;Before Common Era&rdquo;]
religion. It did not exist in the B.C, you know. So, when we talk
about <I>ancient Jerusalem,</I>
there was no ancient Israel &ndash; Jerusalem, yes &ndash; but no
ancient Israel. So, when you think about how preachers and religious
leaders talk about <I>ancient
Israel</I> this and <I>ancient
Israel</I> that, in point of
fact Israel is not a B.C. religion.
<br><br>

The
whole concept of the Old Testament was developed right around the
9th, 10th, 11th and 12th century A.D., [Ed
note: <I>Anno
Domini</I>,
or &ldquo;Year of Our Lord&rdquo; &ndash; now called &ldquo;the
common era&rdquo; and designated C.E., but begins dating from birth
of Christ] so that the
Old Testament is not an <I>ancient</I>
record of an <I>ancient</I>
people. There <I>was</I>
no <I>ancient Israel</I>.
<br><br>

Two
of the greatest scholars &ndash; archaeologists &ndash; in Israel
have written a book called <I>Unearthing
the Bible. </I>These two men,
these two archaeologists, are the best and the brightest of the
archaeologists in Israel.

<br><br>

In
their book, basically that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve said. There was
no Moses. There was no King Solomon. There was no King David.

<br><br>

The
entire thing was written probably in the 8th, 9th, and 10<SUP>th</SUP>
Century
A.D. in Europe, developed, and ultimately all of that was taken by
the Jesuits and the Catholic Church and rewoven into a story and
given to us today as an <I>ancient
Israel</I>. There was no
<I>ancient Israel.</I>
It never existed.

<br><br>

There
was no Moses, there was no King Solomon. <I>Solomon</I>
was <I>Sol-om-on. Sol</I>
is Latin for the Sun; <I>Om</I>
is the Hindu word for the creative force; and <I>On</I>
is the name of the Sun in Egypt. The Greeks call it <I>Heliopolis,</I>
but the Egyptians called the City of the Sun <I>On</I>.
Go look in the dictionary. Look up the word <I>On</I>.
It will tell you it&rsquo;s the City of the Sun in Egypt. This is why
you flip a light-switch <I>on</I>,
because it was a city of light.

<br><br>

So,
you take Sol-om-on, the three names of the sun in the ancient
esoteric languages, it becomes <I>Solomon</I>.


<br><br>

Even
in the ancient Bibles, the old Bibles from the 12th, 13th, and 14th
century, it didn&rsquo;t say <I>King
David</I> &ndash; it kept
talking about <I>King Druid.</I>


<br><br>

And
incidentally, the system of government and laws that we live under
today in America and in the Western world is a <I>druidic</I>
system. America is a druidic country; Canada is druidic. Like I said,
Western civilization is a druidic establishment.
<br><br>

The
druids were a very powerful priesthood in Europe, even before the
Roman Empire existed. They were the attorneys, the lawyers, the
religious leaders, the politicians. It was called the <I>druidic
system. </I>

<br><br>

One
of the most important symbols in the druidic system was a magic wand,
like Merlin the Magician with his magic wand. Orchestra leaders and
conductors use a magic wand. That&rsquo;s a druid symbol.

<br><br>

The
druid symbol of the magic wand was made out of the wood of a Holly
tree. It&rsquo;s made out of <I>Holly
wood</I> and the entire
establishment &ndash; Hollywood &ndash; is a druidic system. So, if
you don&rsquo;t understand druidic symbols, you&rsquo;ll never know
what&rsquo;s going on in Hollywood, and where they&rsquo;re being
financed, who&rsquo;s financing them, and how this stuff really works
in relation to government.
<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
an enormous amount of material out on the web showing pictures &ndash;
from motion pictures &ndash; from five, six, seven years before 2001,
before 9/11 in which 9/11 is in motion pictures, and the original
film of <I>Matrix</I>.
<br><br>

In
the original <I>Matrix</I>
movie, the star is given some kind of an affidavit to sign, which is
his identification or something, and the camera zooms in on it for
just a moment when he&rsquo;s signing it. But if you stop the film,
stop it and back it up and zoom in, you will see the document is
about something that is going to happen. It says September 11, 2001.
And this was way before September 11<SUP>th</SUP>,
before 9/11.
<br><br>

Chris
Carter. Classic example of what I&rsquo;m talking about... Hollywood.
Chris Carter, the creator of <I>X-files</I>.
When <I>X-files</I>
ended, Chris Carter, the producer, started a whole new television
series called <I>The Lone
Gunmen.</I> The very first
movie was a lead-off movie for the new television series, and in that
movie that came out right around February or March of 2001...

<br><br>

February
or March of 2001, Chris Carter&rsquo;s new television show, called
<I>The Lone Gunmen,</I>
was started on Fox television. In the very first episode, it&rsquo;s
talking about how factions within the US government were going to fly
757s into the World Trade Center and knock them down, purposely, and
in the movie, you&rsquo;re seeing the planes going into the World
Trade Center.
<br><br>

That
was back, you know, eight months before it even happened. Chris
Carter is telling you something in the movie, and in the movie they
ask: <I>Well, why are these
people in the government doing it?</I>


<br><br>

And
one of the guys in government said: <I>Because
we need to control the Middle East. We need to control the oil flow;
we need to have a dominant place in the Middle East, so that we can
promote wars, which is good for business</I>
<I>and...</I>
But that&rsquo;s in the movie, and it shows the planes going into the
World Trade Center.
<br><br>

General
Electric. About three or four years before 9/11, General Electric
came out with a refrigerator in Italy, and on the face of the
refrigerator, painted, were two jets flying into the World Trade
Center. It shows the World Trade Center and two big planes flying
into them, and I have many, many pictures from Hollywood showing 9/11
jets flying into the World Trade Center.

<br><br>

So,
all I&rsquo;m saying is that Hollywood knows what&rsquo;s going on,
and this whole thing is being orchestrated from behind the scenes to
knock down the World Trade Center.

<br><br>

The
day it happened, I became so depressed, I just dropped out of
speaking. I no longer toured, I no longer did radio, I no longer
talked to anyone, and I&rsquo;ve been out of commission for many
years because 9/11 just shut me down.
<br><br>

As
far as I was concerned, I was through with America. I was through
with all of it because any country that can buy three high-rises
falling down into dust and not ask any questions about that... I just
gave up. [applause]

<br><br>

[responding
to audience]: Yeah. Because I&rsquo;m well aware of how governments
work, religions work, and banks.
<br><br>

Well,
let me give you an example. There are only two things on the Earth;
land and water.

<br><br>

People
live on land so <I>the law of
the land</I> is the law of
people who live on land. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the law
of the land. But the law of the land is different in every country
because it&rsquo;s the law of the people who live on the land. You
can do things in Russia [that] you can&rsquo;t do in America. You can
do things in South Africa that you can&rsquo;t do in China, so the
law of the land is different in every country.

<br><br>

But
the law of water is the law of money &ndash; the cash flow, the
liquid assets. I&rsquo;ll give you an example of how this works
because when a ship pulls into harbor, it&rsquo;s coming in on water
and it&rsquo;s going to bring products, so all ships by law must be
female. This is why you will always hear a captain saying that <I>she
is a good ship. She is seaworthy.</I>
<I>She</I>,
because all ships are female, and the reason why is because <I>she</I>
produces the product.
<br><br>

When
a ship pulls into harbor, it parks at the <I>dock</I>.
Each piece coming off the ship has to have a <I>Certificate
of Manifest,</I> and the ship
&ndash; where it sits &ndash; is in its <I>berth</I>.
<br><br>

So,
when you were born, you came out of your mother&rsquo;s <I>water</I>,
so you have to have a <I>birth
certificate</I> and it&rsquo;s
signed by the <I>Doc</I>
and if you drop the car or the television, it&rsquo;s a <I>stillborn</I>
so you have to have a <I>death
certificate</I>.
<br><br>

So
your body... as a matter of fact, your body is a security on the New
York Stock Exchange.
<br><br>

If
you take your Social Security card &ndash; and I&rsquo;m not going to
talk much more about this because there are other things I want to
talk about -- but this, I think, is interesting. If you take your
Social Security card, on the back of a Social Security card, you will
see a series of numbers. Those numbers on mine are in red and those
numbers on the back of the Social Security card represent your
physical body on the Stock Exchange in New York.

<br><br>

And
if you take a bill, any kind of American bill &ndash; whatever it is,
$10, $20, $100, $1, whatever it is &ndash; you will see a series of
numbers here, code numbers, on the bill. You match the numbers on the
bill with the back of the Social Security card.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
because there&rsquo;s about six-and-a-half-million dollars or more
circulating around the world with your Social Security number on the
bill because your body has a security on the New York Stock Exchange.
<br><br>

They
are buying and selling your personal body on the Stock Exchange in
New York. Most people don&rsquo;t understand any of this and have no
idea what I&rsquo;m talking about, but it&rsquo;s the way banks work.


<br><br>

And
so I have discovered also that banks and government are basically
based on religion. Religion is at the bottom of all of this.
<br><br>

This
is why I have no respect. I have a respect, a reasonable respect, for
law and order. I&rsquo;m not so stupid as not to understand the need
for red lights and the things which are required in law for people to
live together, but I have no respect for religion, government,
banking, and especially educational institutions, because I know who
finances these organizations. I know where the money comes from.

<br><br>

Our
banks were given to us by the Knights Templars, the Masonic Lodge of
Knights Templars in Europe. Our educational institutions,
universities and colleges, were given to us by the Masonic Order
coming out of Rome.

<br><br>

This
is why the square mortar-board is a Catholic symbol. And Jews... how
many Jews know that when you wear a yarmulke, that&rsquo;s not
Jewish? That&rsquo;s Roman. That&rsquo;s why the Pope wears the
yarmulke. That&rsquo;s why the Cardinals wear the yarmulke. It&rsquo;s
a Roman symbol; it&rsquo;s not Jewish.
<br><br>

The
Jews were told to wear the yarmulke to show subjection to Rome and
they got so used to using it they think it&rsquo;s a Jewish symbol.
It&rsquo;s not <I>Jewish</I>.
It&rsquo;s <I>Roman</I>.
<br><br>

Another
thing that bothers me, too, when it comes to religion &ndash; there
is a world of difference between being anti-<I>Semitic</I>
and anti-<I>Jewish</I>.
It doesn&rsquo;t mean the same thing at all.

<br><br>

So
when you hear someone use the term anti-<I>Semitic</I>
just remember that there&rsquo;s four kinds of Semitic: north, east,
south and west Semitic. And there are 13 different races of people in
the world that are Semitic. The Arabs are Semitic.

<br><br>

So
when you say someone&rsquo;s <I>anti-Semitic,</I>
it means that they are against 13 races of people in the world, 13
nations. When somebody says something about <I>Jewish,</I>
it&rsquo;s anti-<I>Jewish</I>,
not anti-<I>Semitic</I>.


<br><br>

So
it&rsquo;s just a small point but it&rsquo;s big with me because
people use terms and they use the wrong terms and don&rsquo;t
understand what they&rsquo;re saying.
<br><br>

Religion,
government, educational institutions: I have found that so many
people willingly... and as I said last night on this forum, so many
people willingly bend themselves to what their masters want from
them. What your masters want is for you to be in compliance, for you
to think what they have told you to think.
<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
been behind the cameras in national television studios and watched
network news people doing their job. What most people do not realize
is on the nightly news from the networks, when you see the newsman
talking directly to you, he&rsquo;s talking right into the camera
giving you the news. In point of fact, that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s
happening.
<br><br>

There
is a big box, a large box with a television screen on the bottom, and
there&rsquo;s a glass, a clear glass on an angle, and there&rsquo;s a
guy sitting off to the side typing, or it&rsquo;s already typed.
They&rsquo;re telling the newsman what to say, word for word. And so
the television screen is hitting this glass and it&rsquo;s reflecting
straight out so that the newsman can sit right there and look
directly into the camera and read the news.
<br><br>

So
he&rsquo;s just reading what somebody else wrote, and that guy wrote
it because the boss told him what to write. The news is nothing more
than what somebody higher up wants you to believe.
<br><br>

So
that&rsquo;s why I have no respect for the news. I don&rsquo;t watch
television. I&rsquo;m not interested in Hollywood or movies as such,
but there is a lot of interesting stuff in movies.
<br><br>

Government:
Again I say, and it&rsquo;s just my belief, I believe government
boils down to the war between the <I>Crips</I>
and the <I>Bloods</I>.
[laughter] That&rsquo;s all it is. It&rsquo;s just one gang is
superior to another gang, unless of course that other gang gets a
little more money and gets a little bit more vicious; now they take
over town. So it&rsquo;s a war between gangs.

<br><br>

Because
after all, when it&rsquo;s all boiled down, it boils down to one
thing: We&rsquo;re all human, and humans, like Martin Luther King
said: <I>People are
organizations.</I>

<br><br>

Martin
Luther King said organizations are a lot more naughtier than
individuals. Individuals can be bad and corrupt, but when you get a
whole bunch of individuals bad and corrupt and they&rsquo;re wearing
uniforms and wearing badges, now you&rsquo;ve got a gang.

<br><br>

And
the police department even have said that. They tell me things like
that: <I>You know, we&rsquo;re
the biggest gang in town. We&rsquo;re legal. We can do whatever we
want.</I>
<br><br>

So
I understood a long time ago that government is simply gang warfare.
Who&rsquo;s going to run this town? What family in the mob is going
to run this area of the town? So that is why I have no respect for
government, banking, or any of the rest of it.
<br><br>

I
could go on about so many different things that I&rsquo;m interested
in. Again, like I said, religion is a big thing with me.

<br><br>

I
believe that the story about Jesus in the New Testament... it&rsquo;s
just my opinion, but I believe that that story is an encoded message.
It&rsquo;s a metaphor. It does not represent history as such but it
is a very powerful encoded story.

<br><br>

If
you understand the symbols and the words that are used in the New
Testament in the story of Jesus and understand that the entire story
is a metaphor, you read between the lines and begin to see that
there&rsquo;s symbols, and ideas are being expressed and you didn&rsquo;t
even see it.
<br><br>

A
classic example is, why did Judas go out and kiss Jesus? &ndash; just
an example. In the Bible we&rsquo;re told that Judas went out and
kissed Jesus. Christians will tell you: <I>Well,
the reason why he did that was to identify him so that he could be
arrested.</I>
<br><br>

No.
Logic alone would tell you that&rsquo;s incorrect, because Jesus
would not have been living in the south side of Chicago or the north
end of New York. He would have been living in a little Mickey Mouse
little village, probably 300 people there at the most, 15 to 20
minutes to walk across the whole town.

<br><br>

And
so how could he be hiding? Who would be so stupid as to not know who
he is? He&rsquo;s sitting out there in the garden with his followers,
so what do you need to go out and kiss him for&hellip; to identify?

<br><br>

Well,
that&rsquo;s not what the Bible says. It doesn&rsquo;t say he went
out to <I>identify</I>.
It says Judas went out and kissed Jesus <I>to
betray him</I>, not identify.


<br><br>

This
is why the Mafia, when you&rsquo;re going to be killed, they give you
<I>the kiss of death</I>.
In the ancient world in the Middle East, when a scorpion bites you it
leaves two cuts on your skin, and those two cuts look just like human
lips, so the ancient people said you&rsquo;ve been given <I>the
kiss of death</I>.
<br><br>

This
is why when the mob&rsquo;s going to whack you, they give you the
kiss of death, right? It&rsquo;s because the scorpion is a
back-biter.

<br><br>

Jesus
represents in the story a symbol. It&rsquo;s a metaphor, and Jesus is
a metaphor for the sun. And so, boiling it down, Christianity is sun
worship based on astrology, because nobody owns the sun. Africans
don&rsquo;t own it, and we don&rsquo;t own the sun, so obviously the
sun belongs to God &ndash; so it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s sun
[and/or son] and he&rsquo;s
the light of the world.

<br><br>

Of
course the sun&rsquo;s the light of the world. What else lights the
world if it&rsquo;s not the sun?

<br><br>



<br><br>

And
he has twelve helpers. Yeah, of course, the twelve signs of the
Zodiac, the twelve months of the year.

<br><br>

He
is our risen savior. Of course; it rises every morning about 5:30,
and the sun <I>is</I>
your savior. If it don&rsquo;t come up, we&rsquo;re dead.

<br><br>

So
once you start breaking down the symbols in the New Testament, you
begin to see that Christianity is basically Astrology and sun
worship, but it has been so well hidden and so cleverly disguised.
Once you start breaking it down and reading the whole story, it
becomes overwhelmingly obvious that this is what we are talking
about.
<br><br>

He
has a virgin birth; he&rsquo;s born of a virgin -- of course virgin
birth, because one of the constellations of the Zodiac is Virgo,
Virgo the virgin.

<br><br>

Let
me give you an example of how this works. On the first day of summer,
the very first day of summer, the sun is as high in the northern
hemisphere as it&rsquo;s going to go. It doesn&rsquo;t go any further
north.

<br><br>

The
first day of summer, the sun is high in the northern hemisphere and
it begins to work its way south. Each day it moves one degree, and as
it moves one degree each day, 90 days later or 90 degrees later, it&rsquo;s
half-way down. So now we say that the sun was the <I>Lion
King</I> in summer, the Lion
King because the sun was in the constellation of Leo... the Lion King
from Disney.
<br><br>

But
then as the sun moves southward it finally hits Scorpio. So God&rsquo;s
sun
[and/or son] was
really hot. He was the Lion King but now he&rsquo;s <I>falling</I>,
so now we call that <I>fall</I>
because he&rsquo;s <I>fallen,</I>
and he&rsquo;s <I>falling</I>
south, so it moves into <I>fall</I>
in Scorpio.
<br><br>

This
is why Judas gives Jesus the <I>kiss
of death</I> because Judas
represents Scorpio and Scorpio gives God&rsquo;s sun
[and/or son], the
light of the world, the kiss of death and now he&rsquo;s going to die
in Capricorn. He&rsquo;s going to die and go all the way down.

<br><br>

But
what&rsquo;s interesting about this is that the sun goes all the way
down south until it hits what is called the Winter Solstice and
that&rsquo;s on December 22nd.

<br><br>

The
sun hits the lowest point on the sky in the south on December 22nd.
It&rsquo;s called the Winter Solstice, the beginning of winter, and
for three days... the United States Navy will show and explain it to
you, that the sun comes up for three days, the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th
on the same degree. It doesn&rsquo;t go any further south and it
doesn&rsquo;t come back north.



On
the same degree that it was on on December 22nd, the sun rises the
next two days, 23rd and 24th, on the same degree. So the ancient
people said that the sun
[and/or son] was
alive. It was the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Leo, who got the kiss
of death from Scorpio, and now for three days he&rsquo;s not moving
at all, so therefore he&rsquo;s in his tomb for three days.

<br><br>

Then
on the 25th of December, the sun moves one degree northward, and you
can calculate that as the Navy does. You can calculate it. It&rsquo;s
very slight, but if you&rsquo;ve got the right instruments you can
see the sun move one degree northward. Therefore, it <I>came
back to life</I>.
<br><br>

So
now we celebrate God&rsquo;s sun[and/or
son] being born again.
He&rsquo;s born again. When? On December 25th, so we celebrate
Christmas or Christ Mass.

<br><br>

As
the sun moves back towards the northern hemisphere, it crosses over
the equator at <I>spring</I>
because he was dead in winter now he&rsquo;s <I>springing</I>
back to life.

<br><br>

So
as he comes back to life and crosses over the equator there was a
celebration called the <I>Passover</I>
because the sun has<I> passed</I>
<I>over </I>the
equator, coming back to the northern hemisphere.

<br><br>

So
today when someone dies we say: <I>Grandmother
passed last night.</I>
<I>Grandfather passed away,
</I>or <I>they
passed on</I>; but always
<I>passed</I>
was associated with death. So God&rsquo;s sun
[and/or son] has
<I>passed over</I>
the equator.
<br><br>

So
once a year around the world the Jews celebrate the Passover, which
is nothing more than the sun passing over the equator.

<br><br>

Christians,
of course, cannot do that because that&rsquo;s Jewish and they
wouldn&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with the Jewish
celebration, so Christians have a totally different celebration. They
call it the <I>Resurrection
of God&rsquo;s son</I>.

<br><br>

And
so they go out on the Passover and go out and have something called
the <I>Easter sunrise
service</I>. So you actually
have Christians going out and waiting for the <I>sun</I>
to come up for something called a <I>sunrise</I>
service. I mean, what is that all about? Christians are worshipping
the sun?

<br><br>

And
then when you start looking at how the word <I>S-O-N</I>
and <I>S-U-N</I>
are interchangeable in Christianity... and God knows there&rsquo;s a
lot of information on that. So basically you boil down Christianity
as sun worship / Astrology.


The
Old Testament is Astrology / sun worship. Yahweh, as I said, was
associated with the sun and the planet Saturn.
<br><br>

Let
me give you another example about the ancient religions of the world.


<br><br>

Moses
was a lunar deity. Moses was the leader of the Moon cult. This is why
in all the paintings and sculpturing in Europe you always see Moses
wearing horns. Have you ever seen that? Moses wearing horns? It&rsquo;s
in the Vatican. It&rsquo;s in all the museums of the world.

<br><br>

Why
is Moses always pictured with horns? Because Moses was the leader of
a lunar cult, the Moon worshippers. So at one time the Jews were
worshippers of the Moon and that period of time we call the period of
Moses.
<br><br>

This
is why the Native Americans, their chiefs wore horns. The Vikings
wore horns, because all of these cults, cultures &ndash; Native
Americans, Vikings, and the ancient people of the Middle East &ndash;
worshipped the Moon.

<br><br>

The
Moon, of course, in the lower quarter was the horns, and this is why
they wore horns.
<br><br>

In
Arabia there&rsquo;s a high mountain range and at night from the
Egyptian side, the Moon comes up in the east. It comes up from a
mountain range, and so the ancient peoples believed that the Moon was
a god and that it lived in the mountain and so their religious
celebrations of the <I>Old
Man of the Mountain</I>, the
Moon god.

<br><br>

In
the ancient Arabic system the Moon god was called <I>Sin</I>,
<I>S-I-N</I>.
That was his name. The Moon god of Arabia was <I>Sin</I>,
and a mountain in the ancient language a mountain was spelt <I>A-I</I>.
So you take a mountain &ndash; <I>Ai
</I>&ndash; with the god who
lived in the mountain, the Moon god &ndash; <I>Sin</I>
&ndash; and put it together and it becomes <I>Sin-Ai</I>.


<br><br>

So
you get all the... Moses goes up into Sinai. No. It&rsquo;s Sin-Ai,
the mountain of the Moon god. This is why Jews have their celebration
after sundown, because that&rsquo;s when the Moon comes out.

<br><br>

They
don&rsquo;t have their celebration during the day because that&rsquo;s
when the sun&rsquo;s out, so that&rsquo;s the time for Christians to
celebrate God&rsquo;s sun
[and/or son]. The Jews
are worshipping the Moon god, <I>Sin</I>.
<br><br>

So
I don&rsquo;t intend to... I&rsquo;m not trying to offend anyone, but
I&rsquo;m just trying to tell you where religions come from.
Religions have been given to us by the same people who gave us our
government, our banks, our educational institutions. Our whole entire
ruddy system in Western civilization is based on religion, politics,
sex, drugs, and rock &lsquo;n roll.
<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
just <I>business</I>.
It&rsquo;s just money. It&rsquo;s just the control of people.

<br><br>

And
if you think it&rsquo;s crazy when I say <I>sex</I>,
you have no idea in the world how sex plays a part in everything. The
very fact that a man wears a black robe... that&rsquo;s a feminine
dress... and, god, there&rsquo;s so much you could talk about with
this subject of sex in religion. I mean, the whole thing is based on
sex.

<br><br>

The
cross is a sexual symbol. Even in Egypt, the Egyptian obelisk; the
Egyptian obelisk is... like the Washington Monument, for instance.
The Washington Monument has an Egyptian obelisk. An obelisk
represented a male phallic in the erection and the male phallic is
connected to the female ovaries. It&rsquo;s called the <I>oval
office</I>, right? [laughter]
<br><br>

And
the water down... the water strip... is her water, and so when her
water breaks the male phallic connects to the female ovaries, the
oval office. Sexual symbols everywhere.
<br><br>

A
six-pointed star, a star of Saturn.

<br><br>

So
the point I&rsquo;m making is that our institutions around the world,
especially in Western civilization, are based on symbolism, lies,
deception, manipulation of our thinking.

<br><br>

And
somewhere along the line, if you&rsquo;re really looking for truth &ndash;
and most people aren&rsquo;t... Like that movie, when the... who was
it? Tom&hellip; [audience responses] Yeah, in the movie... Anyway,
the kid says he wants the truth and the other guy said: <I>You
can&rsquo;t handle the truth.</I>
<br><br>

[The
move is &ldquo;A Few Good Men&rdquo; with Tom Cruise and Jack
Nicolson locked in a classic court battle over the truth.] I believe
that&rsquo;s exactly right. I don&rsquo;t think that the world of
mankind can handle the real truth about how the world really works.

<br><br>

You
know, I said last night that I believe that democracy is the very
worst possible form of government on the Earth. I don&rsquo;t think
you can get a worse government than democracy.

<br><br>

And
the reason I&rsquo;m saying that, I can clarify it now. First of all
<I>demos</I>
in Greek is <I>a mob</I>.
That&rsquo;s why when a mob is out in the street with plaques,
ranting and raving, we call it a <I>demo</I>-stration.
A <I>demo</I>-stration
is... <I>demo</I>
is a mob of people.
<br><br>

And
so <I>demo</I>-ocracy
&ndash; <I>ocracy</I>
is <I>the rule</I>.
So the rule of the mob is democracy. True democracy is 45 whites
hanging one black. That&rsquo;s democracy. <I>We
all voted and one guy&rsquo;s got to die. We all voted. It&rsquo;s
democracy. </I>

<br><br>

No.
America was founded as a Constitutional Republic. A Constitutional
Republic means there is a set rule of laws that everyone abides by,
and it was set up in such a way as to protect the person, the
individual, from the mob.

<br><br>

You
know, down south where I come from, the Ku Klux Klan, they could pick
out anybody they want, and there&rsquo;s 45 of them and they take you
out and hang you and who&rsquo;s going to say anything? <I>It&rsquo;s
was a democracy; we all voted, and therefore it must be legal.</I>
<br><br>

No.
America was set up as a Constitutional Republic, which means the
Constitution was a law and everyone, no matter who it is in the
country, had to abide by the law and it protected you as an
individual.
<br><br>

The
biggest problem with a democracy is very simple, if you just think
about it. Democracy means <I>mob
rule</I>. It doesn&rsquo;t
matter what the law says.

<br><br>

And
incidentally I want to throw this out to you. We hear all the time
that America is the <I>land
of laws;</I> we are a country
<I>based on law</I>.
In point of fact, that is not true. In point of fact, it is just the
opposite. America is the most lawless country on the Earth. Period.
<I>There is no law in
America</I>.
<br><br>

Think
about that, what I just told you: <I>There
is no law in America.</I>
What we have here is whatever the judge says it is, and whatever the
judge says it is, that&rsquo;s what the law is.

<br><br>

If
you go to a different court, and a different judge, but the same
identical information, facts, and figures, he&rsquo;ll maybe give a
different verdict. <I>Well,
that&rsquo;s what the law says; that&rsquo;s the law.</I>
No, that&rsquo;s not the law. It&rsquo;s what that guy said.
<br><br>

I
learned all of this when I was traveling around, going to the
different churches and different cults. Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses are
a classic example. I could use the Mormons as a classic example. I
could use any of these churches as classic examples of what I&rsquo;m
talking about.

<br><br>

There
is no set law in any religious organization, in the church, or any
cult, or any group, or any political group. It&rsquo;s whatever the
boss in that particular group says it is &ndash; that&rsquo;s what
the law is.

<br><br>

And
so, even in Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses they will have the elder in
that church will tell you: <I>Well,
here&rsquo;s what the Bible says and here&rsquo;s what the law is</I>.
Now, if you go to a different one, he&rsquo;s was like: <I>Oh
that guy&rsquo;s full of bull. Here&rsquo;s what the real thing...
here&rsquo;s the real...</I>

<br><br>

And
then you understand it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you go, in any
Mormon church, in any Seventh Day Adventist church, any
Christadelphian, any World Wide Church of God, any cult, any rabbi,
any synagogue... it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Whoever is in charge of
that one particular church where you are, that&rsquo;s the law.

<br><br>

And
that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s going on in America. It doesn&rsquo;t
matter what the actual law books say. You cannot go into a court in
this country and win on the basis of facts. That is the facts of
life. You cannot win in a court in America on the basis of facts.
Period.

<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

The
judge don&rsquo;t give a damn about the facts. He&rsquo;s the boss
and in this court he calls the shots.

<br><br>

<I>Well
yeah, but the other judge said... </I>

<br><br>

<I>I
don&rsquo;t care what the other judge said. This is my court and I
call the shots, so I will decide. If I kind of like you maybe I&rsquo;ll
give you a break. If I don&rsquo;t like you maybe I&rsquo;ll add ten
years. Now what are you going to do about it? </I>

<br><br>

You
say: <I>Yeah, well, but the
law says...</I>

<br><br>

<I>No,
no. Don&rsquo;t bring that up. This is my court. I call the shots.</I>
<br><br>

Therefore
there is no law. America is a land of lawlessness.
<br><br>

In
the Bible in the Book of Revelations, it talks about <I>the
rise of the man of lawlessness,</I>
and I&rsquo;ve often wondered about that. It is very interesting... a
lot of interesting, important stuff written in the Bible if you know
what you&rsquo;re looking at.

<br><br>

But
it talks about in the Book of Revelation the rise of something called<I>
the man of lawlessness</I>
and I used to wonder what in the world was that all about, because
America&rsquo;s got so many laws. We&rsquo;ve got thousands of law
books. That&rsquo;s all we are: we&rsquo;ve got law books, so how can
there be a <I>man of
lawlessness</I> that would
rise in the world?
<br><br>

Well,
now I understand. America is the home of the man of lawlessness.
<br><br>

George
Bush couldn&rsquo;t care less what the Constitution says, the Bill of
Rights... it just don&rsquo;t matter. He&rsquo;s the boss and
whatever he says do, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing. You say:
<I>But the law says</I>...
They don&rsquo;t care and if you bring that up again, you&rsquo;re
going to jail. Why? Because he represents the Vatican.

<br><br>

The
Bush regime was front for the Vatican &ndash; the most important
enemy this country has today. People will never understand it, but
the biggest enemy that this nation today has is the Vatican. The
Vatican is behind the crap that&rsquo;s going on all over.
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

What
do you think the Founding Fathers, whatever we call them, the
Founding Fathers... Where did they come from, the people who founded
this country? They came from Europe. Well, for 2,500 years Rome,
under the Caesars of Rome, and then after the fall of the Caesars in
the 4th century, and with the coming of the Vatican in the 5th
century, all of Europe has been dominated for over 2,500 years by
Rome. And Europe has dominated the world for 2,500 years.

<br><br>

So
I&rsquo;m saying that if you want to find out who the real enemy of
this country is, you&rsquo;d better start looking at the Holy Father
and you&rsquo;d better start finding out the connection between the
Vatican and the Nazi party of Adolf Hitler.

KC:
 Thank you. Thank you, Jordan. I&rsquo;m sorry... we have very
limited time, so we have to let David Wilcock come on stage now.
<br><br>

JM:
 And I&rsquo;m just getting warmed up.
<br><br>

KC:
 I know you are and&hellip; [applause/ laughter] &hellip; God bless
you. [applause/ ovation/ whistles] That&rsquo;s right. Stand up for
this man.
<br><br>

JM:
 Thank you.
<br><br>

KC:
 Thank you, Jordan. We&rsquo;d love to do a Camelot interview with
you, Jordan. I&rsquo;m saying that here in public on stage. Anytime.
<br><br>

JM:
 I want to add one more comment quickly. When you hear people talk
about Jewish conspiracy, Jewish this and Jewish that... it&rsquo;s
<I>Vatican</I>,
not Jewish. [applause]
<br><br>

KC:
 Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
<br><br>

JM:
 Thank you. Thank you.
