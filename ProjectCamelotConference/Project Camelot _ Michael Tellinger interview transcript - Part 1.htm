<I>[In the first ten minutes of this recording there were technical
difficulties connecting with Michael Tellinger on Skype. Kerry&rsquo;s
comments re connection problems have been deleted, but interesting
bits of information she gave while waiting are included here as

<br><br>



KERRY CASSIDY (KC):  This is Kerry Cassidy, Project Camelot
Whistleblower Radio, and hopefully we will be on the air tonight with
Michael Tellinger. He is the author of <I>Slave Species of God</I>.
He is a wonderful researcher and he&rsquo;s also a musician, which is
absolutely fascinating.




He has basically been investigating the genetic-engineering history
of our species.


He has got archeological evidence that he&rsquo;s been uncovering. He
has two websites. One is <U><A HREF="https://www.slavespecies.com/" target="_blank">https://www.slavespecies.com/</A></U>
 and the other one is <U><A HREF="https://www.adamscalendar.com/" target="_blank">https://www.adamscalendar.com/</A></U>
.  Adam&rsquo;s Calendar will show you some photographs of his
wonderful discoveries in South... I believe it&rsquo;s South Africa,
or somewhere in Africa.


<br><br>


[attempts to connect to Michael Tellinger were not successful at this
time on the tape]

<br><br>


We were on Mel Fabregas&rsquo; radio show, <I>The Veritas Show,</I> [
<U><A HREF="https://www.veritasshow.com/" target="_blank">https://www.veritasshow.com/</A></U>
] today, Bill Ryan and myself. Project Camelot was interviewed for
two hours, I think it was, earlier today. That show was not live,
contrary to what I thought. It was pre-recorded and will be released,
I believe, possibly in a week or so. I&rsquo;m not sure how they
schedule the releases of their shows, but that&rsquo;s what I
understand.


<br><br>


We believe that it&rsquo;s possible that the Haiti earthquake was the
result of the weather wars that are happening behind the scenes. And
that is, I realize, rather stunning information. That&rsquo;s a huge,
huge tragedy. It is quite likely that is part of an overall agenda
being rolled out, as we&rsquo;ve talked about on Camelot from time to
time.




Other than that, let me see if I can add some other information. We
do have a new whistleblower; actually I&rsquo;ve got a few of them.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s an interesting time now. We&rsquo;re really having some
amazing things going on behind the scenes as well as on the more
obvious level. This new whistleblower was talking to us about
synthetic beings coming in through a stargate in the Gulf of Aden and
that right now there is a military buildup in the area &ndash; that&rsquo;s
alongside Yemen, for those of you who don&rsquo;t know and&hellip;
[Kerry goes off air, then back on]

<br><br>


As I was saying, we have a couple of new whistleblowers, one of which
is talking about synthetic beings that are being possibly, maybe,
coming back to this planet &ndash; beings that were created by the
Atlanteans and then taken off-planet prior to the destruction of
Atlantis and allowed to develop. They are basically robots that are
developing on their own, as artificial intelligence does have the
ability to do.


<br><br>


Supposedly they are on the way back to this planet. Meanwhile our
governments have created their own groups of synthetic beings. The
scanners that are being put in at the airports now are part of this
effort, I guess, to identify whether or not the person coming through
the scanner is human or not. That&rsquo;s actually what&rsquo;s
really, really going on. [Kerry goes off air, then back on]

<br><br>


KERRY CASSIDY (KC):  This is Kerry Cassidy, Project Camelot
Whistleblower Radio, and I believe we are now on the air again.
Hopefully this will work. It seems that we&rsquo;re having all kinds
of technical difficulties. Michael, are you on the air with me?

<br><br>


MICHAEL TELLINGER (MT):  I can hear you, Kerry.

<br><br>


KC:  Wonderful. [laughs] How are you doing?

<br><br>


MT:  Excellent! I&rsquo;m very glad to hear voices, finally. For a
while I thought we were going to have these strange gremlins creep in
and prevent us from having a chat.

<br><br>


KC:  Exactly. Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t be that unusual, I have to say.
So, for those of you that have hung on for the last, say, twelve
minutes while we&rsquo;ve been getting ourselves hooked up here...
I&rsquo;m on the air. This is Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot and
we&rsquo;re on the air with Michael Tellinger.


<br><br>


Michael is an author-investigator and he has written a couple of
books &ndash; actually I think at least three &ndash; one of which is
a very well known book called <I>Slave Species of God.</I> This is
all about the evolution of man and basically calls into question a
lot of the preconceived notions of where we came from, how we were
genetically engineered. It follows along with the work of Zecharia
Sitchin, in my view, and maybe we can discuss that in more depth.


<br><br>


Other than that, from what I understand you&rsquo;re also a musician.
Isn&rsquo;t that right?

<br><br>


MT:  Yeah, that&rsquo;s true, Kerry. What I find interesting is that
when I watched one of your interviews, one of your many interviews, I
noticed that quite a few of the people that you interview started
life as musicians. It seems that this musical vibrational frequency
seems to penetrate all forms of life, and especially those that start
to question life and origins at a later stage in their personal
lives.


<br><br>


I know David Wilcock is a musician himself, and Einstein was a
musician, and many of my other scientist friends are musicians that
played music in their earlier careers. It&rsquo;s very interesting.


<br><br>


I grew up in a musical family; my mother sang opera in Europe, and
then when we moved to South Africa, she was very active in the opera
and the classical musical circles here. She still teaches today at
the age of 76. She still teaches music as a sort of a&hellip; she&rsquo;s
known as &ldquo;The Voice of Peyah&rdquo;, a magician.

<br><br>


KC:  Oh, that&rsquo;s fabulous. It will interest you to know that I&rsquo;m
also a singer/songwriter, of a sort. I was very much involved in
music and I actually have just got done recording an EP, I guess you
call it.

<br><br>


MT:  Yeah.

<br><br>


KC:  So I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun with music myself. And
yeah, I think that there is a synchronicity there with quite a few
people that have musical backgrounds being interested also in
science, and for lack of a better word, the occult or the hidden.


<br><br>


MT:  Yeah. You know what I find interesting, Kerry, is that if you
understand the concept of music and how music works, it&rsquo;s a lot
easier to understand the vibrational frequency spectrum and how it
all fits together &ndash; and harmonic frequencies &ndash; and how
things can be harmonious; and resonant frequencies and octaves and
the concept of different dimensions when you break them up into
vibrational scales and so forth.


<br><br>


It really... just suddenly, the light&hellip; Once that penny drops
for you, you step out of the musical realm and you step into the
scientific realm and the penny drops for you, you see that there&rsquo;s
an absolute parallel crossover from one to the other.


<br><br>


KC:  Yeah, I have to agree with that. I know that, for example, Dan
Burisch and Marcia McDowell are working with something they call
<I>Lotus,</I> which has to do with healing abilities of crystals.
They&rsquo;ve been investigating that for some time, I believe.


<br><br>


I also understand that you are using sound in... and maybe you can
correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but from what I understand, you&rsquo;re
actually using sound in order to help you in your archeological work.
Is that right?

<br><br>


MT:  Yeah, it&rsquo;s true to a large extent. It&rsquo;s really the
sound &ldquo;element&rdquo; and the understanding of sound
frequencies that got us to... well, me specifically, to sit up and
pay attention to the structures of these ancient stone ruins: the
kind of stones they used, why they built in specific forms and
shapes, and why they&rsquo;re all connected by these strange channels
that we called roads, originally.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s only when we started thinking of frequency, and
specifically sound frequency as a potential solution, the penny
dropped for us and we could unravel what I believe is one of the most
amazing discoveries in human history and the evolution of humans.


<br><br>


And also, presenting the evidence that many people like Zecharia
Sitchin... and many others that I&rsquo;ve met with here in South
Africa &ndash; Credo Mutwa being the other one  &ndash;  people have
been writing and talking about the origins of humankind, and these
&ldquo;First People&rdquo; that lived here in Southern Africa, and
have been ridiculed for it for many decades.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s just really exciting to be finding and discovering, on a
daily basis, the physical evidence to support all those early
writings, often where people went on just feelings more than
scientific fact.


<br><br>


We now are starting to find overwhelming physical evidence and proof
for those first early civilizations of very early <I>homo sapiens</I>
living in South Africa and Southern Africa.


<br><br>


KC:  So how is it that you are actually using music or sound to aid
you in your work?

<br><br>


MT:  Well, what first caught my attention was the fact that the
stones that have been used to build these circular stone ruins, these
ancient ruins, they ring like bells &ndash; every stone. Especially
when we started clearing the sites to be able to take people to them,
the ones that we&rsquo;ve chosen that are easily accessible... as we
started clearing the sites, I started realizing this strange,
incredible sound and noise that these stones were making.


<br><br>


I suddenly realized that this wasn&rsquo;t just an accident because
these stones were making a completely different sound, and they rang&hellip;
As I say, they actually ring like bells, the most beautiful crystal
or metallic structures. And I&rsquo;m going to be loading some of
these sounds onto my various websites very soon just so people can
actually hear it.


<br><br>


KC:  That&rsquo;s really fascinating. I think that that is so
interesting. How did you come to discover that they rang like bells?
I mean, you were moving them and they made sound? Or did you actually
have a theory and start, I don&rsquo;t know, beating against them to
see if they made different sounds?

<br><br>


MT:  No, it was... [laughs] You know, discovery is a strange beast.
It really is; and it takes, sometimes it takes a few days, sometimes
a few weeks, sometimes a few months, and this particular discovery
took us more than seven years to figure this out. And many times
these things happen by accident.


<br><br>


I already had a theory that the circular shapes of the stone ruins
were there for a specific purpose and reason, to generate energy of
some sort, and that these ancient civilizations used the energy that
they generated in these circular structures to extract the gold and
to crush the ore and to transport the ore... well, use the energy
that&hellip;


<br><br>


The moment you see a circular structure, the alarm bells should start
to ring if you know anything about frequency and sound and generation
of energy.


<br><br>


That&rsquo;s exactly what happened to me. I just immediately felt
somehow, intuitively, I suppose &ndash;  I&rsquo;m not a psychic but
I&rsquo;m a very strong intuitive and that&rsquo;s been becoming more
and more active in my life. I realized that these were energy
devices.


<br><br>


Then suddenly, a few weeks later, we accidently discovered, as you
said... while we were clearing the sites, I discovered that these
stones have this incredible &lsquo;ring&rsquo;.


<br><br>


So I went back on the mountains and I started experimenting with
these rocks and tapping them in different ways with different objects
and seeing how they ring. And then I discovered that not only do they
ring like bells, but different stones seem to have been chosen for
specific sounds and what seems to be very specific reasons and uses
in sound generation.


<br><br>


For example, the flat stones that they use to construct the walls of
the circular ruins have very distinct and separate frequencies. We
did a recording a few weeks ago, just before Christmas. I went and
spent the whole day, or actually two days, recording the sounds. Then
we sat and analyzed these sounds in a sound studio and captured the
frequencies, recorded the frequencies.


<br><br>


I mean, you know what I mean by frequencies, Kerry, since you&rsquo;re
a musician, so you understand what I&rsquo;m talking about.


<br><br>


We&rsquo;re talking... these are stones in circular ruins, okay? We
captured from 200 hertz, which is very low frequency. The human
audible range goes down to, arguably, around 30 hertz. All right? So
we recorded from 200 hertz, all the way up to 60,000 hertz... so 60
kilohertz, which is starting to approach the upper limit of human
hearing. That&rsquo;s what we found.


<br><br>


So already we find that just the stones that were used to build the
outer circular walls have this amazing capacity.


<br><br>


Then what we find in among the stone ruins are these very strange,
sausage-like long stones. They differ in length from probably about a
meter, sometimes even longer, to a foot or two feet. In diameter,
they vary from two or three inches to probably about six or seven
inches.


<br><br>


These are like long crystals. And when you lift these stones up,
these long, sausage-like stones, those are the ones that ring most
beautifully and most clearly; and the sound carries. It&rsquo;s
absolutely spectacular. It literally takes your breath away when you
hear it for the first time.


<br><br>


KC:  Well, this is fascinating. I think it&rsquo;s so interesting
that you would be a musician, have that background, and then also get
into sort of this really unusual field that you&rsquo;ve sort of
ended up in, and I would love to know how you ended up in this field.


<br><br>


I know we had you on our show when we did the other rendition of the
Project Camelot radio show, and excuse me if I did ask you this back
then, but I am very curious to have you share with this audience a
little bit more about your background. I know that you have a medical
degree. That also seems like sort of out of left field, [laughs] I
have to say, in relation to archeology.

<br><br>


Then I also want to say that it seems to me that with the sound, the
frequency that these stones have... from what I understand it&rsquo;s
possible they also used sound to move them into place, just as they
did with the Great Pyramid.


<br><br>


I&rsquo;m seeing from your writings here that this find that you
have, this Adam&rsquo;s Calendar in general, is located, possibly on
a ley line, or a longitudinal line, which is the same as the Great
Pyramid. Is that correct?


<br><br>


MT:  That&rsquo;s correct, yeah. I think maybe what I should do is
put into a larger perspective for your listeners and for the
audience, just so they will know what the bloody hell we&rsquo;re
talking about.

<br><br>


We&rsquo;re talking about a discovery of a very large ancient
settlement of circular stone ruins that covered, at one stage over
200,000 years ago already&hellip; I know that&rsquo;s a number that
many archeologists and historians really struggle with, but that&rsquo;s
their own problem; they need to come to terms with that. There was a
very, very large ancient settlement of over ten million stone ruins
that I&rsquo;ve counted. And there are more &ndash; I stopped when I
got to about ten million. [Kerry laughs]


<br><br>


And that changes our perception of ancient human history completely.
Whatever you held dear or close to your heart, or whatever you
believed before, flies right out the window. It forces us to sit down
and re-evaluate everything we thought we knew about our ancient human
history.


<br><br>


We&rsquo;re dealing here with a vanished ancient civilization that
existed at the bottom tip of Africa, South Africa &ndash; and
Zimbabwe mainly &ndash; incorporating the Great Zimbabwe Ruins,
incidentally, for those that don&rsquo;t know that yet.


<br><br>


All of these structures, every single one of them, were circular in
its shape, and each of them was linked by a <I>road</I> or a <I>channel</I>.
Now, that is highly irregular; you don&rsquo;t see that in any
ancient civilizations at all.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s completely unbelievable for us to consider that such a
civilization could have existed that was so vast. It makes the cities
of today absolutely pale by comparison in their size.

<br><br>


And then in among all of these stone structures there are thousands
of kilometers of beautifully shaped and constructed agricultural
terraces that link all of these structures together.


<br><br>


KC:  Okay. I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt you here... we&rsquo;re about
to go to break. We&rsquo;ll be right back on the other side of this
hour, and this is Michael Tellinger on Project Camelot Radio.

<br><br>


[break]

<br><br>


KC:  This is Kerry Cassidy, Project Camelot
Whistleblower Radio. We&rsquo;re on the air with Michael Tellinger,
who has written a wonderful book, <I>Slave
Species of God</I>, and a couple of
other books as well. Michael, are you there?

<br><br>


MT:  I&rsquo;m here.


<br><br>


KC:  Okay great. So, you were actually giving
an overview of the structures themselves, and that is also
fascinating and I&rsquo;d love you to continue. I&rsquo;d also like
you to cover a bit of how you got into this in the first place, after
that.

<br><br>


MT:  Okay. Where was I, Kerry? I think I was
talking about the agricultural terraces. Is that correct?

<br><br>


KC:  Yes, exactly.

<br><br>


MT:  So... [Michael gets disconnected]

<br><br>


KC:  Hello? For some reason we&rsquo;re having
some trouble hearing you, at least at my end. I don&rsquo;t know if
that&rsquo;s true for everyone.

<br><br>


MT:  Can you hear me now?

<br><br>


KC:  Yeah, now I can.

<br><br>


MT:  Okay. So just to put it into perspective,
imagine the whole of Southern Africa, pretty much most of South
Africa, and including Zimbabwe, being covered in a continuous stone
settlement made up of <I>millions</I>
&ndash; over 10 million &ndash; circular stone ruins linked by
ancient roads.


<br><br>


All &ndash; each and every one &ndash; of these
roads is walled on the sides by stone walls. And then connected...
all of this, in between all of this, you have thousands of
kilometers, miles, of agricultural terraces that were neatly and
beautifully constructed.

<br><br>


Which brings to mind, I asked you how many
people must of have lived here, and my estimate and my calculation
would, say, anything between 50- to 200-million people, you know...
the guess is yours... over a very extended period of time.

<br><br>


And those kind of numbers just do not jell with
our understanding of human history, especially when you start going
back to 200,000 or 280,000 years ago.


<br><br>


The way that I got involved in this was because
of my book called <I>Slave Species of
God</I>, as you mentioned earlier, that
deals with the origins of humankind and the evidence that points...
that we are a cloned race, a cloned species, that was specifically
intended for a very single-minded purpose, and that was to mine gold
out of the gold mines in Southern Africa.

<br><br>


Which brings us to the third important anomaly
here among these ancient civilizations, and that is the thousands of
gold mines &ndash; thousands of ancient mines that we&rsquo;ve
discovered.


<br><br>


Personally I&rsquo;ve probably crawled through
at least a hundred of these ancient mines, and they all look very
similar, you know. Either they&rsquo;re big holes in the ground or
they&rsquo;re long passages and channels carved into the sides of
mountains.

<br><br>


Some of them have survived. Some of them have
been re-excavated and reopened by the gold miners in the gold mine
rush, the Gold Rush of the 1850s, the mid-1800s, the same as there
was in California and Australia. There was a similar one here in
South Africa that then set up the city of Johannesburg and opened up
the Gold Reef.

<br><br>


Well, guess what? These guys didn&rsquo;t
discover the gold. This gold was being mined here 280,000 years ago
when it started, according to my research.

<br><br>


KC:  That&rsquo;s really extraordinary. I&rsquo;m
wondering, just off hand, whether or not those link-ups or some of
your discoveries were helped to any degree by Credo Mutwa, or other
sort of indigenous peoples to the region that might have had stories
or so on, that related to the discoveries that you&rsquo;ve made.

<br><br>


MT:  Definitely. Credo Mutwa has played a very
important role, and continues to play a very important role in these
discoveries.


<br><br>


As I mentioned earlier, you know, Credo has
been saying some very remarkable things for decades, for over 50
years already, and he&rsquo;s been ridiculed for it and laughed at,
you know, that he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;madman&rdquo; and so forth, by the
establishment.


<br><br>


Well, fortunately we&rsquo;re now discovering
that everything Credo&rsquo;s been saying is true. And I&rsquo;m
discovering that, almost on a weekly basis, everything that Credo has
told me personally in the past year and a bit has been turning out to
be <I>true</I>.

<br><br>


First of all, just to link him to these
discoveries... I met a chap called Johan Heine,
who came to one of my <I>Slave Species
of God</I> presentations in Pretoria.


<br><br>


After my presentation he said to me: <I>Listen,
I&rsquo;ve got to show you some photographs. I&rsquo;ve been
photographing these weird, strange stone structures from the air for
the last 15 or 20 years, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to show them to
the authorities and the archeologists, and so forth and they just
keep telling me they&rsquo;re not important, they don&rsquo;t mean
anything.</I>


<br><br>


So when he showed me these stone ruins, I just
instinctively and immediately knew that there was something really
important about them.


<br><br>


Well, a few months went by and eventually Johan
organized a helicopter [ride]. He runs the biggest forest
firefighting project here in Southern Africa, so he&rsquo;s got
helicopters and airplanes that fly all over the place and fight
forest fires and so forth. So he organized a helicopter for us to go
flying around and over these ruins.

<br><br>


And I literally... my life was changed. In one
day my entire life changed and I realized that we were dealing with
something so monumental that it would probably consume the next
decade of my life or so. And since then 2-1/2 years
have gone by and that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happening.

<br><br>


We realized that all the work that I was
writing about and the research I was dealing with in <I>Slave
Species of God</I> was now finding its
roots and the physical evidence for these ancient civilizations and
the first people on Earth, right here in South Africa &ndash; and it
all revolves around gold.


<br><br>


I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re aware of this from
all the interesting people that you&rsquo;ve interviewed and spoken
to over the years that you&rsquo;ve been running Project Camelot.

<br><br>


KC:  Well yes, actually. We know in essence the
Enlil / Enki story of the origin of man, basically told in part by
Zecharia Sitchin and then picked up by some others. I&rsquo;m just
curious if you are aligned with Sitchin&rsquo;s view completely, or
do you diverge in any particular areas?

<br><br>


MT:  Well, I suppose I&rsquo;m in line with
Sitchin&rsquo;s work and his writings. I&rsquo;m becoming more in
line with it the more I look at these structures and the discoveries
that I&rsquo;m making. And the discoveries Johan Heine made.



<br><br>


First of all, the stone calendar that we now
call <I>Adam&rsquo;s Calendar</I>
&ndash; that is the other book that I wrote with Johan Heine, <I>Adam&rsquo;s
Calendar</I>, and that deals with the
discovery of this ancient stone calendar site at a place called
Kaapsehoop in South Africa in the Mpumalanga [province].



<br><br>


That is just spectacular because the calendar
still works today, but it is so... The structures, the attributes of
the calendar are so strange and so weird, that it really boggles the
mind. And the age of it is so staggering that you really have to dig
deep into your understanding of what&rsquo;s been happening on this
planet Earth.

<br><br>


What I find interesting is when you read
through the works of Sitchin, and especially the <I>Lost
Book of Enki</I>, there are various
references. Now remember, when Sitchin wrote that he didn&rsquo;t
know anything about this ancient civilization or the structures that
we&rsquo;re discovering now.

<br><br>


The more I go back to that particular book,
especially the <I>Lost Book of Enki</I>,
I&rsquo;m finding incredible, very accurate references to some of the
things that we&rsquo;re discovering.


<br><br>


For example, he mentions that about <I>&ldquo;</I><I>40
shar&rdquo;</I> after arriving on planet Earth,
Enki built himself a special place of observing &ndash; <I>&ldquo;observation
in the deep Abzu, on the edge of a cliff overlooking the valley&rdquo;
</I>&ndash; all kinds of references like
that. It was in line with his <I>&ldquo;abode
in the north&rdquo;,</I> which I believe
was the Great Zimbabwe and the <I>&ldquo;twin
peaks&rdquo;</I> further up, which I
believe are the two big Pyramids in Giza.


<br><br>


And guess what? We find that Adam&rsquo;s
Calendar is exactly in line with Great Zimbabwe and furthermore also
exactly in line with the Great Pyramid of Giza along the 31-degree
longitudinal line and 31-degrees east longitude. And that&rsquo;s not
a coincidence.

<br><br>


KC:  That&rsquo;s fascinating. I&rsquo;m
reading bits and pieces of the <I>Lost
Book of Enki</I> and find it fascinating
myself. I&rsquo;m wondering if you are also then looking at that book
now for further clues as to what you might search for.

<br><br>


MT:  Definitely. I was able to get myself an
electronic copy of it, so it&rsquo;s easier to reference and find
things, find specific references that I&rsquo;m looking for, which
has helped tremendously. There is also a wonderful reference to
Enki&rsquo;s younger son.

<br><br>


By the way, Kerry, I believe that you&rsquo;re
psychic yourself. I&rsquo;m not sure what your personal sort of
strengths and paranormal strengths are, but I pick up from the work
that I&rsquo;ve been watching that you&rsquo;re quite psychic.


<br><br>


KC: [laughs] Yes, thank you. I appreciate that.
Yes, I am finding more and more. Actually, I think, as you said, it&rsquo;s
becoming a bigger and bigger part of my life as time goes on.

<br><br>


MT:  Yes. Well, as I said, I&rsquo;m not
psychic, but I&rsquo;m intuitive, highly intuitive, and I&rsquo;ve
started to really trust that side of my psyche. And whenever I read
something or I suddenly have a weird thought that I believe has been
channeled to me by a Higher Intelligence, or Higher Powers, or
whatever, I take it and I run with it.

<br><br>


I have been finding that since I&rsquo;ve
started doing that, things have become a lot easier and it&rsquo;s
just amazing how things unfold.

<br><br>


Just to once again put things into some sort of
chronological order here, it was really the discovery of Adam&rsquo;s
Calendar by Johan Heine in 2003 that really opened up the door to
this discovery and realizing how much larger and bigger this ancient
civilization is.


<br><br>


You know, Johan was told that these
circular structures were of no historic importance. They were just a
bunch of cattle <I>kraal</I> [Ed. note: corral] that
were built by the migrating Bantu people or the people during the
South African Boer War &ndash; they built them for their cattle or
quick settlements while they were migrating or something like that.


<br><br>


Well, you know, those were just such ludicrous
and stupid statements to make by historians and archeologists. And I
can understand why they would make those kinds of statements, because
they just had no clue or understanding of the size and extent of this
ancient civilization, how many of these stone structures there are,
and how big these ancient cities once were.

<br><br>


They just did not have a clue, so they would
make silly statements like: <I>Well, you
know, these structures were built by the migrating Bantu people and
they were moving south, and they were probably built by the women and
children</I>, and stuff like that.


<br><br>


And these are the stories that go into our
history books. I&rsquo;m absolutely appalled by the lies and the
inaccuracies that have been written into our history books.


<br><br>


And then they make statements like: The
channels or these roads that you see that link these stone
structures together, they were built by the Gedi people or the Bakoni
people to drive their cattle on, and stuff like
that. They just make stuff up and put it in the books. [laughs] It
just drives me nuts.

<br><br>


KC:  [laughs] Well yeah, I think that that&rsquo;s
true and I think it&rsquo;s fascinating because I&rsquo;m kind of
looking over the Net and I&rsquo;m seeing that in many ways you&rsquo;re
actually out there doing some work that isn&rsquo;t being done. Even
with all the people we&rsquo;re interviewing, there are not a lot of
archeologists, or even people that are researchers in general, that
seem to be following your work closely as I have been to some degree,
and also because I&rsquo;m aware that it seems that you&rsquo;re
going down a road that most people just simply are not.


<br><br>


I find it very fascinating. I see that they
tend to want to sort of paint you as somebody who is a <I>dabbler</I>,
who sort of stumbled into doing this on the side. But what I really
see is that this in many ways is really a mission for you.

<br><br>


MT:  Yes, this definitely has become a mission.
And the more people say things about me or call me a dabbler &ndash;
great. The more they talk about you, the more other people discover
your work, you know, and that&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m okay with that.
[laughs]

<br><br>


KC:  But, you know, actually it&rsquo;s so
groundbreaking that it&rsquo;s, again, one of those kinds of things
that we come across on Camelot, which is: <I>Why
isn&rsquo;t this front page news?</I>
You know? In essence.


<br><br>


MT:  Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you why. I can tell
you why it&rsquo;s not front page news and this has been happening to
me for the last 2-1/2 years. I&rsquo;ll get a phone call from a
journalist &ndash; and incidentally that is why I actually now close
the doors to all South African journalists. I do not talk to them
anymore because they behave so badly and like spoiled brats. They
just seem to have no backbone or journalistic integrity, if you want
to call... if there is such a thing.


<br><br>


KC:  Well, I hope so. [laughs]

<br><br>


MT:  [laughs] Well... You see, you&rsquo;re
working outside of the field. You&rsquo;re not really working in the
mainstream. You know, your articles don&rsquo;t appear on the 8
o&rsquo;clock news and your interviews don&rsquo;t appear on <I>60
Minutes</I> and so forth.


<br><br>


KC:  Absolutely.

<br><br>


MT:  You&rsquo;re working out of the
field yourself.


<br><br>


KC:  Yes.

<br><br>


MT:  I&rsquo;m talking about the mainstream
journalists, the people from television and radio and the <I>Sunday
Times</I> in Soweto. They make an
appointment with me... well, this is a while ago now, when we first
started making these discoveries two years ago. And then they come
and spend an hour or two interviewing me and I tell them all the
stuff that we&rsquo;re discovering and then they go: <I>Okay,
well this is just too far out. I can&rsquo;t believe any of this</I>
&ndash; which I can understand.


<br><br>


Once again I love this thing. People say: <I>I&rsquo;ve
never heard of it</I>, and they use that
as a scientific argument, you know... which is fantastic! [laughs]


<br><br>


KC:  [laughs] Exactly.

<br><br>


MT:  They&rsquo;ve never heard of if, it can&rsquo;t
be [unclear &ndash; sounds like he says &ldquo;<I>supper&rdquo;</I>],
you know.


<br><br>


And then these journalists run off to some
professor or some academic at university at Johannesburg or Cape
Town, and say: <I>Well
Michael Tellinger says that they&rsquo;ve discovered these...</I>
And what does this poor academic know? They know absolutely nothing.
They lead poor sheltered lives. I feel sorry for these people in
these little academic boxes behind walls in universities.

<br><br>


You know, the last time these people were out
in the field was probably 20 years ago and now suddenly they get
confronted by some journalist that tells them this guy has discovered
the ancient Lost City of Enki or Solomon&rsquo;s Gold Mines, and
stuff like that, and these guys: <I>Ah,
man, it&rsquo;s a bunch of rubbish</I>,
you know. That&rsquo;s their answer.


<br><br>


And guess what the journalist does? The
journalist goes back to his office and later writes: <I>Michael
Tellinger is talking rubbish, because professor so-and-so says he&rsquo;s
talking rubbish. </I>And that&rsquo;s
what happens.


<br><br>


KC:  Yeah, exactly. It&rsquo;s like a vicious
circle.


<br><br>


One of the things that I can give you a clue to
&ndash; and I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever heard this &ndash;
and this is something that&rsquo;s never been said on the air before.
I&rsquo;m going to sort of cross some lines here, but I&rsquo;m not
going to reveal my source, and so that&rsquo;s the only thing I can
do here to protect the innocent, so to speak. [laughs]

<br><br>


But Zecharia Sitchin was actually channeling &ndash;
whether people want to believe this or not &ndash; the Anunnaki, when
he was writing some of his books. This is something that I was told
confidentially by one of our sources.


<br><br>


It just boggles the mind when you take that
into account and you look at the work that he&rsquo;s done. It does
make logical sense because he&rsquo;s absolutely been prolific in
this particular area.


<br><br>


So one might say that in some ways you have to
be in some way psychically, intuitively, tuned to an era, to a group
of people, to events, and so on, in order to even pursue it, I think,
with any diligence. And so perhaps there is something going on with
that in your own life, but I wanted to throw that out just in case
you&rsquo;d never heard it.

<br><br>


MT:  Yes, thanks Kerry. I appreciate that and
that opens a very important door to me, to be able to tell you that
I&rsquo;ve also channeled the Anunnaki &ndash; not just on my own,
but in a whole group of people, so it&rsquo;s not just me that can
vouch for that.


<br><br>


I was fortunate enough to be visited by a very
well known psychic lady by the name of Jackie that works in
Johannesburg. Jackie brought two groups of people here to Adam&rsquo;s
Calendar during the course of last year, 2009. Both times she had a
channeling which I was invited to after I told them everything I
knew, shared all my knowledge and information with them, told them
what I believed scientifically and what I believed intuitively and
how the two fit together.


<br><br>


I told them that I believe that the site was
built by Enki and that his youngest son, Dumuzi was buried
there as well &ndash; and that is, incidentally, also referred to in
great detail, or in some detail in the <I>Lost Book of Enki</I> and
the whole thing of Inanna and Dumuzi and how
she buried him <I>&ldquo;on the edge of
a cliff in the </I><I>deep Abzu&rdquo;.</I>


<br><br>


I now believe that one of the sites at Adam&rsquo;s
Calendar is actually Dumuzi&rsquo;s grave,
and how it&rsquo;s linked to the Pyramids further in the valley by a
beautiful Golden Mean spiral and so forth.


<br><br>


So I went into this channeling and we actually
channeled Enki, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll... [Michael&rsquo;s
voice is lost]

<br><br>


KC:  Oh wow, you&rsquo;re breaking up, so I
hope I&rsquo;m not losing you. This is a fascinating story. Are you
back, Michael?

<br><br>


MT:  Yes, I&rsquo;m here. Can you hear me?
[phone sounds were very broken up]

<br><br>


KC:  Yes. Well, I think that some of the Powers
That Be are probably not happy with you saying that you guys are
channeling Enki. I think that this is probably true and I thank you
very much for coming forward with that. Have you been talking about
this in any other places of venues?

<br><br>


MT:  No, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve
mentioned this anywhere to anyone.


<br><br>


KC:  Wonderful.

<br><br>


MT:  So we actually channeled Enki, and he
confirmed everything that I intuitively felt and believed about the
site. Adam&rsquo;s Calendar was commissioned and built by Enki;
Dumuzi is buried there at the site; and
it was built as the flagship and the centerpiece of his ancient
beloved Lost City; and he spoke in that channeling.


<br><br>


I actually have transcripts of that channeling
which I can sort of somehow start making available when the time is
right. He talks about his ancient beloved city &ldquo;<I>here
in the deep Abzu</I>&rdquo; and how much
he loved it.


<br><br>


And that just also made me realize a few other
things, because, you know, for a while... well, not a while... for
quite a long time I believed that the Anunnaki were these disgusting
malicious people, you know, the humanoids that just abused the <I>Homo
sapiens</I> and so forth &ndash; and
that suddenly changed. My perception of that changed and I&rsquo;m
seeing things slightly differently now.


<br><br>


KC:  That&rsquo;s actually very fascinating, I
have to say, because in reading the <I>Lost
Book of Enki</I> and finding out that
Sitchin was indeed channeling, and also because we are going down
that road in Camelot, investigating some of the ETs that are behind
the scenes &ndash; both the positive and the negative &ndash; in
terms of influencing the Powers That Be to do what they&rsquo;re
doing today... In other words, this story isn&rsquo;t over and I
think there are clues way-back-when in terms of what you&rsquo;re
investigating, what you&rsquo;re finding out.


<br><br>


The idea is also that there is a lot of
confusion around who the Anunnaki were. There is a confusion with
reptilians. There are people out there that are basically, as you
said, they are having points of view in which, in essence, all the
Anunnaki are negative, this and that and the other.


<br><br>


I, myself, have had a very stunning dream about
what in essence seemed to me to be an Anunnaki. And certainly I
didn&rsquo;t even believe that there could be beings that were as
tall as they have been purported to be. I know there are skeletons
that have been found around the world... We also interviewed Klaus
Dona. Are you familiar with Klaus Dona, by the way?

<br><br>


MT:  I&rsquo;m not, I must admit, and I feel
embarrassed to say that. I&rsquo;m not.


<br><br>


KC:  No, no; it&rsquo;s no problem.


<br><br>


MT:  I thought I was well informed. [laughs]

<br><br>


KC:  [laughs] No, I&rsquo;m sure you are
actually; we can&rsquo;t all know everyone. It&rsquo;s just that
Klaus Dona is someone who has been on the circuit and we have done an
interview with him in Vienna. He&rsquo;s one of those people doing
similar things to what you are, in terms of ancient archeology that
is not accepted by the mainstream.


<br><br>


We&rsquo;re going to a break. We&rsquo;ll be
right back on this fascinating discussion on the other side of the
hour.
