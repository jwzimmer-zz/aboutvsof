This is Kerry Cassidy and                Bill Ryan from Project Avalon and Project Camelot. Today is September                23rd, 2008, and we're here with George Green, and we're very                happy to be talking with him today.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George,                    why don&rsquo;t you update us as to what&rsquo;s going                  on with the U.S. economy and possibly some other things?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George                    Green (G):&nbsp; Kerry, the economy is kind of an oxymoron                  today, because it&rsquo;s all coming apart at the seams. One                  of the problems that we have today is the definition of money,                  which nobody can identify, frankly, and the meltdown of not                  only the dollar but trade throughout the whole world. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many countries &ndash; and I just talked to some other ones &ndash; are                  not willing to take the dollar in exchange for goods at this                  minute.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">China and Russia are meeting right now, trying to create some                  new kind of basis of a currency they can use for exchange.                  The Russian warships are -- these are nuclear warships -- are                  heading down towards Venezuela. We just got through having                  one of the Russian drones over Georgia, just shot down by Georgia.                  That was just a couple hours ago. We also have warships moving                  into the Mediterranean.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile,                    the dollar itself: &nbsp;The bailout program is                  unprecedented because they&rsquo;re talking about giving away,                  my sources are saying, up to a trillion and a half dollars                  -- if they can find a buyer for this currency -- to liquidate                  private industry, basically, and protect the bankers.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Fannie                    Mae / Freddie Mac people... I mean, they&rsquo;ve                  taken out like 100 million dollars just for their own personal                  benefit, their houses and everything else, before this debacle                  happened. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So                    what do you think this movement to Venezuela of Russian warships                    is all about?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well... I&rsquo;m trying an overview. If you&rsquo;ve                  got the world meltdown happening, you&rsquo;ve got politics                  happening, both of the so-called candidates for the presidency                  trying to keep people really confused, Kerry. This situation                  is that we have... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;re kind of like the old thing, &ldquo;a barrel going                  over Niagara Falls&rdquo;? Well, we&rsquo;ve gone over Niagara                  Falls. Now the question: Is it gonna hit? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since we                    have a bankrupt country, a bankrupt currency, what are other                    countries gonna do with that to accept goods if we&rsquo;re                  gonna have some? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, you                    know they&rsquo;re not going to transfer. I mean,                  that&rsquo;s obvious, when China said, <em>Look, if you want                  to buy our goods, you pay us in some other currency</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the                    question is, how do you transfer a dollar to some other currency,                    since all the other countries are afraid? Meanwhile, the                    crew &ndash; Paulson, etc. &ndash; are working with the                  banks up there to protect the bankers. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we                    get the next problem:&nbsp; The American public for,                  you know, a long time has been geared up that stocks are money.                  Well, they&rsquo;ve been a trading vehicle, but they&rsquo;re                  really not money. That&rsquo;s just a gambling casino that&rsquo;s                  set up here. We trade a piece of paper, you know, allegedly                  saying it&rsquo;s worth something.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But if                    they can arbitrarily move, like they did a week ago, United                    Airlines stock down to where it was basically worthless in                    one day and then bring it back up again, you know they&rsquo;re                  manipulating the game. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s the Plunge Committee in New York. The Plunge                  Committee &ndash; they&rsquo;re members of the Federal Reserve                  and the Treasury Department, to make sure that the market doesn&rsquo;t                  collapse all the way. And I&rsquo;m predicting the market&rsquo;ll                  go back down to 8,500 here very shortly. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I mean,                    it&rsquo;s down again today and it will continue,                  though, because people are gonna try... They&rsquo;re                  running to liquidity. The next thing they&rsquo;re looking                  to is to get physical possession of something. That&rsquo;s                  the reason why gold and silver right now is hard to get ahold                  of.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s not a question of being there. I was at the Silver                  Conference the last couple of days with the world silver mines.                  The problem is, like, silver&rsquo;s trading roughly... to                  buy it&rsquo;s around $14 today. The problem is that the processed                  silver, if you want to look at it, or fabricated silver, is                  hard to get. I can get all kinds of 1000-ounce bars, but you                  can&rsquo;t use that for trading stock.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, meanwhile,                    I just got notification that a couple countries in Latin                    America are considering creating their own currency now because                    the dollar&rsquo;s going down. They&rsquo;re actually                  working on it this minute. I&rsquo;m working on a couple of &rsquo;em,                  with a couple of the countries down there, to try to get gold                  and silver as the backing for their currency, to make it what                  we call a <em>substantial </em>thing. As long as they&rsquo;re                  willing to take the dollar, then you can trade it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    other things that are happening: &nbsp;Many people                  are trying to acquire the raw materials. Well, raw materials                  may be two months&rsquo; delivery or three months&rsquo; delivery.                  That&rsquo;s the basis of the options right now, or people                  having physical. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That&rsquo;s                    the meltdown of the market that we&rsquo;re looking                  at. And the meltdown of the people looking at: What&rsquo;s                  a piece of paper called a stock worth? And how can they manipulate                  the price?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like in                    an emergency, if you lived in a house right now and you had                    to go sell it today, and if there&rsquo;s no lenders                  out there, what does that mean?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:&nbsp; What                  exactly is going to happen if the dollar is basically not                  transferable around the world? In other words, they won&rsquo;t                  take it? Then who cares what...? I mean, I don&rsquo;t                  even know how the stock market can be holding its own within                  a situation like that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, it can&rsquo;t. All you have to do is trade                  100 shares in a stock, Kerry. You took 100 shares. That&rsquo;ll                  give you an arbitrary value of all the rest of the millions                  that are out there. So just a few shares traded between a couple                  of brokers, without manipulating the market as such, will tell                everybody, <em>This is really good.</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Name me                    a company that makes money in the stock market. The stock                    market is just stocks trading between each other. The physical                    reality... You have people like General Motors                  and Ford, and whatever, are asking for a 25 billion dollar                  bailout in this new program they&rsquo;re trying to put together                  in the bailout of the bankers themselves. And yet they want                  the American taxpayer to take it over, but they&rsquo;re not                  telling you the truth. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">September                    30 &ndash; I think we&rsquo;ve mentioned it before                  -- is the fiscal year of the United States. Well, that&rsquo;s                  only, you know, less than a week away. Right? The question                  that they have is, when they admit debt, if they admit it --                  because nobody has ever audited this material -- they don&rsquo;t                  tell you what the debt is from next year, and the next year,                  because they make these long-term commitments in bonds.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The truth                    is, and my feeling is, that we&rsquo;re probably                  a couple hundred trillion in derivatives out to the wind right                  now, which is basically the collapse and the bankruptcy of                  the United States. And if we go bankrupt... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That&rsquo;s                    the reason why I think the Bank for International Settlements                    is so important. They want to audit the Federal Reserve,                    because the Federal Reserve has been pushing money out, keeping                    our country going -- 2 billion dollars a day!</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If they&rsquo;re doing that, then the next question is, what                  does the little guy on the street do? And I&rsquo;m urging                  them, if they have some old appliances, go buy some new ones                  right now to get ready for when this meltdown happens, there                  won&rsquo;t be any distribution of goods. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My sources                    are telling me, like K-Mart and Sears aren&rsquo;t                  declaring their sales right now because they&rsquo;re so far                  down. Now, they&rsquo;ve come out of bankruptcy -- you know                  they merged -- and I expect them to go back into bankruptcy.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was at                    a meeting with the shopping center people. 40% of the shopping                    centers right now are basically empty. They&rsquo;re                  running out of people. In order to pay their rents they'll                    have to find a way to bring in a lot more people. So                    we have a combination problem that is just melting down in                    front of everybody. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now what can we do about it? Get your food stored up.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; We actually got a communiqu&eacute; last                    night saying that people around the country are having trouble                    actually buying gas. Have you heard that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Yes. Of course. Two things: The gas is available.                  It&rsquo;s the problem of the distribution of it because of                  electricity, and the trucks, and the rest of it, getting it                  across the country. So we know that gasoline is gonna go up                  in value. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;ll probably be on par with Europe before long, $8                  or $9 a gallon -- if we can get it. We&rsquo;re still importing                  70% of our gasoline products in the United States. If we were                  to start a new refinery in the United States, it would be 3-1/2                  to 4 years before it&rsquo;d come to fruition.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile,                    how do you get this stuff processed? Most of the oil in Alaska,                    for instance, goes on huge tankers to Japan, which basically,                    it&rsquo;s kept them afloat, because they                  process that high-sulfur oil. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile,                    Latin America has been selling their oil to Mexico. Mexico                    imports 40% of its oil right now, and the, what do you call                    it, the peak oil. So it will probably be out of oil itself                  within the next 4 to 5 years. Not that they don&rsquo;t have                  agreements with Brazil and other ones to do offshore drilling.                  They just don&rsquo;t have the ability to transfer it. And                  they&rsquo;re exporting 30% of what they import. And what they&rsquo;re                  doing is marking up the oil prices back to the United States.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, the                    wild card in this is China. China&rsquo;s coming                  in with, you know, 140... well, they have trillions of                  dollars. They have a trillion-400-billion dollars. And they                  had 400 billion invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And                  they&rsquo;re very upset about this. In fact, their military                  said if the dollar collapses, they will consider it an act                  of war.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; What                    about the Japanese?

Between Japan and                  China, they have over a couple trillion dollars of our debt.                  So how do you bail it out with IOUs? See, that&rsquo;s all                  we&rsquo;re doing, is trading debt for debt. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; The whole thing is in debt.

They&rsquo;re                  getting all kinds of money that&rsquo;s being transferred to                  them for so-called safety.

Where would they loan it                    to? You know, what instruments are out there that would be                    considered safe enough to say, <em>Hey, I&rsquo;m                  gonna save your money</em>.

And all the currencies are going to be at risk                  in a One World government, basically, because until they decide                  whatever that One World currency is going to be...

If                  they can get everybody diverted, looking at the money meltdown,                  then the next step is gonna happen within -- and I predict                  that they&rsquo;ll probably call a national emergency -- but                  they&rsquo;re gonna begin WW III. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is                    a happening stance.

Our                  thought was they were going to distract the population with                  the <em>war</em> such that the currency would... You know,                  they&rsquo;d take their eyes off the currency. Because, at                  least in the United States, people are going to be focused                  on the economy. That&rsquo;s always first on their list. Right?                  If we go to war with another country, they&rsquo;re not... They&rsquo;re                  gonna look over there, but basically their concern is going                  to be with the economy.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, the transfer of goods, exactly right. But remember,                  foreign countries aren&rsquo;t going to take the dollar. So                  we&rsquo;re going to have two types of dollars, one foreigners                  are going to look at -- whatever that&rsquo;s gonna be secured.                  Right now they&rsquo;re confused because they don&rsquo;t want                  to take them. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second                    one is the one that you and I are going to be trading here                    in the stores temporarily.

In other                  words you&rsquo;ve been able to buy, you know, a dozen oranges                  for a dollar.

If you&rsquo;ve got a                  toaster that&rsquo;s ten years old or that&rsquo;s on the blink,                  go out and buy a new one, because they won&rsquo;t be available.                  I mean, you can buy &rsquo;em real cheap right now.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Converting                    your dollar into some kind of asset. And gold and silver,                    for instance, has always been the situation. There&rsquo;s                  plenty of silver available. However, there&rsquo;s only a 5-month                  supply of silver in the world market, if you look at the world                  market on all this stuff. <br>                  The trouble with silver right now is the fabricated products. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gold, meanwhile,                    the treasury is way behind on producing it.

Well, PayPal is                  a private organization and they&rsquo;re trying to bail out                  all these things to keep it even, transfer of goods and stuff.                  But it&rsquo;s not going to be even now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;re gonna have all kinds of meltdowns just like you&rsquo;re                  talking about.

There&rsquo;s amazing economic consequences                  to all of this. People are just not traveling. They&rsquo;re                  not doing anything, and then the storms are messing up. We                  don&rsquo;t have the money to take care of it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don&rsquo;t know if you know this. The stuff that happened                  in Florida five years ago in the last storms down there --                  these cities haven&rsquo;t been rebuilt. There&rsquo;s no money.                  And then they&rsquo;re asking for people to come out under                  this new bailout program, no source of security to get a loan,                  that is, if the property would qualify, just to keep an illusion                  of money out there that they can sell to somebody else that                  we&rsquo;re already in debt to. That&rsquo;s foreign governments.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And now Paulson said on TV, <em>Hey,                      we&rsquo;re gonna bail                    out the foreign banks that have our paper</em>. Now, when                    are the American people gonna wake up to what&rsquo;s going                    on? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Monopoly                    game is over. Somebody else owns it, and somebody else is                    gonna be answering to a higher power. And the American people?                    They&rsquo;re just pawns in the game.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Who is this &ldquo;higher power&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s                  what we want to know. And where are they going to run with                  it next? You&rsquo;re talking also about layoffs, aren&rsquo;t                  you, in companies? Because at this point it&rsquo;s kind of                  hidden from the American people, but I think that obviously                  there&rsquo;s gotta be a huge unemployment rate.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Kerry, the real reality is, when they lay off people                  or buy them out or whatever they&rsquo;re doing across the                  country, they&rsquo;ve left this big gap. Our problem in the                  United States is that 50% of the people, or half, you know,                  150 million people, are over age 50. Where are these people                  gonna go? Because all their pension funds are gone.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They&rsquo;re going to be looking to Social Security and Social                  Security funds are gone. They&rsquo;ve been all borrowed by,                  again, the Treasury. They issue &rsquo;em IOUs back to Social                  Security, so it&rsquo;ll keep it going for a while. But this                  whole thing is coming apart in every direction.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peoples&rsquo; pension funds, like the airlines, their pension                  funds are gone. All the automobile companies&rsquo; pension                  funds were sold, or transferred, basically, to the unions up                  there, but they weren&rsquo;t feasible anyway. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Inflation... and they don&rsquo;t tell the people the                  truth on that. It&rsquo;s the old story, you know, <em>Figures                  don&rsquo;t lie, but liars figure</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like what                    you just said, there&rsquo;s massive unemployment.                  I don&rsquo;t have the exact figures. We&rsquo;ve been trying                  to get to those. But we expect that that&rsquo;s over 14%,                  the same as the inflation rate. The inflation rate&rsquo;s                  going up.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, if                    you&rsquo;ve got an arbitrary rate of 12%, if you want                  to, that means the goods will cost in 6 years twice as much                  as they will today -- at 12%. That also means the dollar will                  go down, and that value will be worth 50 cents on the dollar.                  So what can you have that offsets that? Well, you have to have                  a 24% return to break even!</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With --                    between inflation and return -- that only means one thing:                    Total collapse of the system as we know it. For instance,                  right now as you and I are talking, the Dow&rsquo;s down 120-some                  points. Gold and silver are off slightly because this is controlled                  by the option market. But the truth is... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">See what                    you can do to acquire physical gold and physical silver and                    hold it, because that&rsquo;ll be your trading stock.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But you can&rsquo;t eat money. Right? So, in the                  end... I mean, I can see how we can trade these dollars                  even though they don&rsquo;t mean much outside the country.                  But if I&rsquo;m traveling, what happens to my dollar when                  I go overseas? Because I will be going overseas shortly, and                  I want to transfer that into another currency. Are they gonna                  allow it? Obviously the worth of the dollar is gonna be down.                  You say it&rsquo;s maybe 50 cents on the dollar. But is it                  actually 50 cents on the dollar outside the country, or is                  it worse?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s worse. It&rsquo;s up to the country                  and it&rsquo;s up to the banks that transfer it. Most everything                  runs through Chase right now, transferring through the world,                  and what they&rsquo;re doing is, anything over $10,000, they&rsquo;re                  really checking it out even if they&rsquo;ll allow the transfer.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kerry,                    believe it or not, I went over to Bank of America, which                    is a small place. By the way, they&rsquo;re in the top                  100 list of banks that may fail, according to the FDIC. I pulled                  out $2,500 in cash in small bills, because I didn&rsquo;t want                  anything over a 50, because 100s aren&rsquo;t accepted overseas,                  so what you look at... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was trying to get the bills, but I took all their cash!                  Now, it happened to be an oddball time. They said, <em>Wait                  till Monday. We&rsquo;ll get our new supply of money</em>.                  But they don&rsquo;t have it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so,                    what they&rsquo;re looking at... We&rsquo;re                  looking at the system. People are offering, you know, debit                  cards, this kind of stuff, but that&rsquo;s also the same kind                  of a deal. How does MasterCard and Visa, since that&rsquo;s                  the world&rsquo;s money, you can use it anywhere right now.                  Right?&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are                    either created by debts or they&rsquo;re created                  by debits, one way or the other -- now to transfer to other                  countries, which is the real problem, and in what currency?                  Now, that&rsquo;s up to the Bank for International Settlements                  who controls all of this stuff out of Switzerland.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. But are we still in the state where they&rsquo;re                  not coming in until after George Bush leaves office?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well,                    the Bank for International Settlements got approval to audit                    the Federal Reserve after Bush gets out of office. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What&rsquo;s                    the definition of <em>out of office</em>? As                  soon as the election&rsquo;s over? What if he calls a national                  emergency or we get a war started? Then all of that, his agreements,                  then become moot because a) He won&rsquo;t be out of office;                  b) We won&rsquo;t have an election and at that point we&rsquo;ll                  become a socialist state.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; We understand that the possibility that the election                  may be postponed for several months is a real one. I mean,                  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard about the &ldquo;October                  Surprise&rdquo;, the things that are going around about October.                  Have you heard anything personally from your insiders about                  this particular month and some of the things that might be                  coming down?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, again, October is merely the date because it&rsquo;s                  right before the election time. And so they&rsquo;re going                  to make some kind of plans that come up. And, Kerry, I&rsquo;ll                  probably know more in the next couple weeks. They&rsquo;re                  more concerned right now with the economic main stream and                  how to keep the people asleep. [Kerry laughs] Seriously. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yeah.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; And people are totally asleep. They have no idea.                  They go on about their business. They&rsquo;ll still run down.                  And my comment from the people, even my own kids: <em>It&rsquo;ll                  be OK. They&rsquo;ll get it all taken care of.</em> And they                  want to keep on living in la-la land. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a fallacy. I mean, this thing called &ldquo;bailout&rdquo; is                  absolutely an illusion. There&rsquo;s nothing behind the bailout.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; No. But they&rsquo;re creating... giving one                  man total power of about a trillion-and-a-half dollars? I mean,                  they&rsquo;re asking for 750 or 800 billion dollars today. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Congress,                    the congressmen are starting to look at the thing, because                    how can you tell in 24 hours what is going to go on and how                    they&rsquo;re going to give this money out? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if                    it&rsquo;s a debt, then who&rsquo;s going to give them                  the money to do that? They say: <em>Well, we&rsquo;re going                  to get rescued from foreign countries.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, you                    probably know Barclay&rsquo;s and a couple of other                  ones who were gonna pick up some of the main street houses                  at the last minute on a Sunday... All of a sudden they&rsquo;re                  merged in with Bank of America or somebody else and foreign                  governments were willing to come in to protect themselves. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, right                    now that&rsquo;s off the table. There isn&rsquo;t                  going to be any protection of the dollar from plunge. And whatever                  Bernanke and etc., and Paulson, are saying now, we&rsquo;re                  going to go ahead and protect foreign banks. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what&rsquo;s happening is the whole world&rsquo;s                    melting down, as you and I are talking about, and how are                    we gonna be able to exchange goods? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s the old story of being over in Hawaii... I                  have friends there. When they get goods, it all comes in on                  a ship. Well, if the ship doesn&rsquo;t come in, how are they                  gonna survive on these little islands? That&rsquo;s the whole                  problem.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. Islands are gonna be in real dire straits.                  So what is going on? I mean, from your perspective, like... Let&rsquo;s                  stand back even further and look at it from a spiritual perspective.                  Are you getting any information from your contacts?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Oh what... You                    mean off planet?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; The                    Pleiadians or whatever. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; No. My contacts are above the Pleiadians. And what                  they&rsquo;re basically saying is get ready for WW III, which                  is going to last about 4 years and 3 months.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; How can we go to war, though? I mean, is this going                  to be the bailout for the US economy, like it&rsquo;s been                  in the past? In other words, to rev up the military machine?                  I mean, my experience has told me that a lot of the military                  companies are doing better than they&rsquo;re ever done before.                  I mean, they&rsquo;re building and they&rsquo;re selling. And                  this war machine &ndash; massively -- all over the world; deals                  for high tech machinery and planes and what-not.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s it. Get the war going again and                  everybody&rsquo;s got the products to be able to do all this                  stuff. The problem, again, is will it begin WW III? That&rsquo;s                  part of the population reduction program. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I mean,                    they put the Guidestones up there in Georgia that say... Hey, they&rsquo;ve done it already. Right? They                  want to get 500 million people, 20 million Americans. There&rsquo;s                  300 million people in the United States. And in the end, the                  United States is basically bankrupt. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what                    we&rsquo;ve done is taken most of the world&rsquo;s                  goods on debt and said, <em>Yeah, other countries have allowed                  this</em>. Well, they worked on a trade and hoping there would                  be some stability. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, how                    come China and Russia are meeting today as we speak, trying                    to create something new?

They have more people, well, as you know, about 4.5 times                    the population in China alone, and half of them are basically                  middle class at this point. And they&rsquo;re able to export                  goods because we&rsquo;re buying &rsquo;em.

But if we&rsquo;re not buying those goods                  because we can&rsquo;t afford it, what happens then?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, we have 4% of the world&rsquo;s population?                  Forget it. Goodbye United States. That&rsquo;s the end of a                  200-year so-called democracy that&rsquo;s at the end of its                  cycle. It&rsquo;s kind of like the end of the game. In order                  to keep the game going, they&rsquo;ve gotta get a war started. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, what&rsquo;s gonna end up after that? Kerry, it appears                  that we&rsquo;re going to have massive confusion and it&rsquo;s                  probably gonna be smart, like what you guys are doing -- head                  south to Australia where the inner circle&rsquo;s gonna hide                  out.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Really? In Australia? I mean, we&rsquo;re going there                  for a conference, so, you know, we&rsquo;re not going there                  to live. But you&rsquo;re saying that this might be a country                  that is viable in the long term?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; In the long run, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re                  looking at. It&rsquo;s got a lot of problems down there, too,                  you know, weather and everything else. But they will be able                  to be viable. They&rsquo;ll be in the southern hemisphere.                  There won&rsquo;t be the reactions from the nuclear radiation,                  etc., down there. Because they&rsquo;re planning... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Look, they                    tell you that they&rsquo;re using nuclear right                  now. They tell you that they&rsquo;re moving a nuclear ship                  down to Venezuela right now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is                    the Soviets. And they&rsquo;re loaded. They have 22,000                  nuclear warheads. There&rsquo;s no treaty on the board. And                  when Condoleezza Rice told the Soviets to lay off of Georgia                  right now, they&rsquo;re ignoring all of that, because they                  know where the power is. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Russia provides Europe with what? 65% of its energy from                  oil and gas? They can shut that whole thing down right away.                  It becomes a huge economic game.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                    But our understanding is that the ETs are not gonna allow                    for nuclear war. What do you think about that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve been told that. It bothers the ETs.                  And you know, they have plans, too. And what they&rsquo;re                  looking at... Every time a nuclear bomb goes off, there&rsquo;s                  always, publicly we&rsquo;ll hear about, there&rsquo;s always                  an ET craft around, monitoring it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we&rsquo;re also in the process of, you know, Planet X                  coming by in the next whatever it&rsquo;s gonna be, 15 or 20                  years which... That energy is gonna be affecting the planet,                  too. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So this is a pivotal point, the ending of this cycle, if you                  want to, the end of this age and moving into the Aquarian Age. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And all                    of this information and data, I mean, you can get a lot of                    it from the World Watch Institute in Washington, DC, on the                    physical reality. Most people don&rsquo;t care. I mean,                  their mailing list is less than 5,000 people in the whole world.                  They keep track of everything, the air, the water, the whole                  game. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The increase in the population today is over... I mean, use                  your Google and Google <em>population clock</em> and you&rsquo;d                  be able to see that we&rsquo;re at approximately 6.8 billion                  people. The net increase is 200,000 a day, or 2 million every                  10 days, or 5 million every month. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile,                    we&rsquo;ve got 5,000 airplanes flying in the air                  at 30- to 36-thousand feet, spewing out fumes and everything                  else across the United States; 25,000 around the planet. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;re just consuming all the goods, and what I call                  the heat factor on the planet, and we&rsquo;re reducing the                  whole thing to a total mess. So they have to go ahead with                  the Global 2000 agenda. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And like                    I say, I sat in on that, and that&rsquo;s 30 years                  ago. And remember, the plan was to get a war started in the                  Middle East in the year 2000. Well, we haven&rsquo;t seen it                  open up yet but I betcha it&rsquo;s gonna be coming up here.                  And that may be your &ldquo;October Surprise&rdquo; that you&rsquo;re                  talking about.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well, we just interviewed Bob Dean. He&rsquo;s also                  talking about Planet X as a reality and that it&rsquo;s incoming.                  And he had some pretty outrageous information in regard to                  that. He apparently is getting his own contact, ET contacts,                  which he terms the Anunnaki. Apparently there&rsquo;s a good                  faction and a bad faction, just as Zecharia Sitchin was talking                  about. And he&rsquo;s also got insider contacts going way back                  at the Pentagon and so on. And basically he says they&rsquo;re                  scared to death about the impact of Planet X.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, you know, we have to look at it. We were basically                  engineered, if you want to look at it, by Anunnaki and other                  extraterrestrials. I mean, our DNA can be really easily programmed.                  And our government is totally aware of the DNA programming,                  in fact, you know, putting down all of the factions of controlling                  your size, shape, color, how long you&rsquo;re going to live                  and everything else. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is                    all part of the situation. If you can get people to understand                    that we were engineered, as a huge... basically                  an experiment. Planet Earth is the prison planet. And are the                  Anunnaki going to come back? And what are they going to do? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is                    the question of the energies of the universe. And my understanding                    is that in the next 30 years we&rsquo;re going                  to have a big changing on the planet, from the very physical                  standpoint. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As my senator                    says, within 6 months you won&rsquo;t recognize                  the dollar. Well then, in 6 months we&rsquo;re going to be                  in WW III. When&rsquo;s it going to start? It could start this                  weekend, the way things are heating up. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But October&rsquo;s a good time, before the election. They                  want to do it before the election, because, that way, whatever                  the president we have in force, whether it&rsquo;s Obama who                  the Rockefellers want in or otherwise. Obama at this point                  is favored in this thing, so they&rsquo;ll get him in. But                  he&rsquo;s just there as a scapegoat. They really have no power.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been told also that Chertoff has sort                  of a special position within this whole Illuminati roll-out.                  Are you familiar with what he&rsquo;s involved in and where                  he stands?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; No. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of payoffs that                  they do. You know, when you start running around with the players                  that are up on top... As Kissinger said, the absolute                  aphrodisiac is power. And so as long as you&rsquo;re willing                  to sit up in front and be responsible for it, they&rsquo;ll                  reward you. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s                    kind of like the old, you know, the Skull and Bones group.                    When the Skull appoints you, you can run around within that                    area, but you always put somebody else to be the fall-guy                  out there. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I&rsquo;m not privy, frankly, to some of the information                  that&rsquo;s going on with Chertoff, nor am I privy to what&rsquo;s                  going on with the War College, if you want to look at it. But                  I do have some people leaking out information to me occasionally.                  My CIA friends are unfortunately out of the country right now.                  They said they&rsquo;re safe. [laughs]</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. But do you really think that, for example, Ecuador                  and South America is safe? I understand it&rsquo;s safe from                  the nuclear winds, so to speak. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But there                    are other issues down there, like, for example, if the economy                    goes down, down there. And you&rsquo;ve got                  an indigenous population, and they&rsquo;re not white, and                  they&rsquo;re easy to spot. You&rsquo;ve got these communities                  that basically are gonna become fortresses. Right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there&rsquo;s also the issue about... the                    volcanic question. Volcanoes get triggered by the movement                    of Planet X getting closer and the sun getting triggered.                    What happens?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well,                    you know, I looked at all of Latin America. The only country                    I have not visited at any time was Chile. The rest of them,                    I can understand why, you know, like Bush just bought a bunch                    of property in Paraguay. Ted Turner has all kinds of property                    in Argentina. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you                    look at it, Ecuador is about the physical size of Colorado.                    The volcanoes are active down there. Well, we have volcanoes                    that are semi-active up here in some way. I mean, Yellowstone                    Park is semi-active, if you look at it. I mean, it&rsquo;s                    venting all the time, so it keeps the pressure off. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what                    we&rsquo;re looking at down in Ecuador, you can pick                  a climate, and pick an elevation, and pick a location away                  from them. My understanding is that&rsquo;s going to be OK.                  The indigenous people, they kind of stay away from everything. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are                    more European, ethnically, background, in Ecuador. Obviously                    the problem with Ecuador is the language. It&rsquo;s                  all Spanish and unless you speak Spanish it&rsquo;s a little                  harder. And there are groups over there that are setting up. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it&rsquo;s a very friendly country. And you don&rsquo;t                  have the problems that you have in other ones where they&rsquo;re                  building... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like going                    to Mexico City. When you go to Mexico City, you see everybody                    has bars on their windows. I didn&rsquo;t see                  many of those anywhere in Ecuador. People there are not out,                  you know... not that there&lsquo;s not petty thievery.                  That&rsquo;s everywhere. I mean, go to Washington, DC, in our                  country. Right now there&rsquo;s more people killed every month                  by gunfire in Washington, DC, than in Iraq.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Really. That&rsquo;s                    incredible.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s true. And I won&rsquo;t                    go to Washington, DC, at night time and walk on the street.                    You almost have to have a bodyguard. And they tell you that!</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. But what about... I mean, you&rsquo;re talking                  about food shortages. You&rsquo;re talking about the dollar                  going down. I mean, South America has got to be affected by                  that. Aren&rsquo;t their economies going to be affected?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, I happen to know that... I just talked yesterday                  with the people down in Ecuador and the president down there                  is working on a new currency in order to replace the dollar.                  I&rsquo;m talking with people in Panama right now to create                  something like that. Panama&rsquo;s always been on the dollar. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There&rsquo;s only three currencies in the world, you know,                  and at this minute it&rsquo;s been gold, oil, and drugs. And                  I&rsquo;m not in any one of those things other than buying                  gold. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oil &ndash; I am in the oil business indirectly because I                  used to be an officer of King Resources, or, Recovery Resources.                  That&rsquo;s John King, which was the first oil billionaire,                  that had the offshore oil up in Alaska. And we drilled oil                  wells. I&rsquo;ve done all the rest of it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And oil &ndash; there&rsquo;s plenty of oil &ndash; it&rsquo;s                  just the cost of getting it out of the ground. And the cost                  today, from the physical point, is around $80 a barrel. Then                  the other costs to it are the distribution and everything else                  that&rsquo;s going on to get the thing back up. And it&rsquo;s                  probably back up to $150 a barrel before long to get along                  with the world at this minute.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile,                    Saudi Arabia walked away from OPEC meeting the other day,                    just flat out walked away.

Well,                    George, this is very disheartening in certain ways. Do you                    have any tips for what may be called the <em>Ground Crew</em>? For                    people that are awake, know what&rsquo;s going on, and                  actually what they can do?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, the only good suggestion I&rsquo;ve had... I&rsquo;ve                  got people up in a little community up here, that&rsquo;s kind                  of Ground Crew people, that formed a community <em>within</em> the                  community. And they&rsquo;ve been advising all their friends,                  because a lot of people won&rsquo;t listen to them, as you                  know. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what                    they&rsquo;re doing is, though, they&rsquo;ve set                  it up. When everything falls apart, their little community                  will be sustained by itself. Because you&rsquo;re going to                  have to have water and electricity and everything else. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But if                    the whole community will get behind a few people that know                    what the knowledge is, because they&rsquo;ll come forth                  at that point. In other words, you&rsquo;ve got a community                  of 3 &ndash; 4,000 people, maybe there&rsquo;s 50 or 100 that                  know what&rsquo;s really happening. They can organize themselves. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not setting                    yourself as a target out here in a small community, but making                    the whole community aware of it through whatever kind of                    information they can transfer. Because that&rsquo;s                  the key.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; What                    do you think about the internet? How long is this going to                    hang out there and be available to the average person, do                    you think? Is that going to be affected by the dollar going                    down?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Oh, of course. They&rsquo;re going to be at some                  point shutting the thing down, the internet itself. It&rsquo;s                  like China won&rsquo;t allow a lot of our information to go                  over there. They shut it down. So you know it&rsquo;s able                  for them to shut it down. But also the power generation in                  order to even get to it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You use                    some of the internet for communications throughout the world.                    You know, I use Skype, etc. I don&rsquo;t know how                  long that&rsquo;s going to continue on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When that                    happens, you&rsquo;re going to see commerce basically                  collapse because this has all changed. All the networks are                  all going to the internet. We&rsquo;re not gonna have program                  TV other than through the internet.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Now, we have started this website called projectavalon.net                  and we&rsquo;ve got a forum on there. We&rsquo;ve got people                  exchanging information about resources, networking, building                  small communities, this sort of thing. It&rsquo;s really taking                  off in a huge way. We&rsquo;d love to have you come on there                  and sort of advise people whenever you felt the inclination.                  And certainly we&rsquo;re going to be putting this audio interview                  on there. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know                    you were on Coast [coastocoastam.com] the other night, and                    basically you&rsquo;ve been out there for quite a long                  time sort of trying to wake people up. Where are you at now                  with all this, personally? Are you ready to leave the country?                  Or are you still going to hang in here?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, the ETs told me to wait. But I am packed and                  ready to go, and I&rsquo;ve liquidated all my real estate holdings                  that I&rsquo;ve had. And I&rsquo;m just in a preparation mode                  to get ready to get away from harm&rsquo;s way. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But at                    this minute I&rsquo;m still planning on doing lectures                  in different communities across the United States while I can                  still go, because we still have to waken a few people up. There&rsquo;s                  a lot of people out here that will be awakened when the chaos                  starts. And remember: Out of the chaos we&rsquo;ll create something                  new.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well,                    do you feel that you can give any kind of sense of hope for                    something that might emerge? In other words, waking the people                    up is one thing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;re actually talking about group meditations and things                  that can change the entire consciousness of the planet and                  redirect the energy into a more positive place. Because once                  you wake people up, that&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s about.                  Do you think that that has any basis in the future? And have                  you thought about that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; My understanding is that there&rsquo;s                    too few to make any significant difference. And the question                    is on how you can be in direct contact, to act as the hands                    and feet at this level, through the transition. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And meditation                    and prayer and asking for these things is generally on that                    self-survival mode. And what we have to look at is a group                    thing. What can we do? The planet&rsquo;s gonna take                  care of itself. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What we                    have to do is look at mankind, and how can we get information                    and receive the information on a direct basis? People should                    be on direct information from what we call, if you want to                    call it, the universal mind or god or however you view that,                    of the thought... Again, we&rsquo;re thought                  made manifest. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    question is, the manifestation display is totally out of                    whack, Kerry. I know we have to go through the chaos. And                  we&lsquo;re not going to be able to stop the chaos, because                  it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense when you look at what we&rsquo;re                  doing to the planet itself. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So if you&rsquo;re asking me what&rsquo;s going to happen?                  I do have some extraterrestrial information basically saying                  we&rsquo;re going to have WW III begin right away. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I keep                    watching some things on the west coast, though. I think that                    the west coast earthquake&rsquo;s going to occur before                  the war begins. So that could happen momentarily.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well, I have to say that I&rsquo;ve been getting                  some psychic information the same way. But I&rsquo;d like to                  have a more positive outlook here. I do believe we are getting                  a collation of information about a possible natural event during                  the month of October.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s a comet. That could                  happen. Kerry, I&rsquo;m totally concurring. I&rsquo;m just                  telling you that my research...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know, I talked to the FEMA guy down in Arizona, and he                  said: <em>We&rsquo;re preparing for only 100,000 Californians.                  We can&rsquo;t take any more than that when this happens.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was in                    Sacramento.

Whatever you&rsquo;ve believed                  in, you&rsquo;re going to have to be responsible. The word                  is <em>responsible</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The responsibility                    is for each individual to take the information, do some research,                    go on the internet, do whatever you can for each of the ones                    particularly. Pitch it whichever way your reality is. Try                    to get your family awakened -- and that&rsquo;s                  a hard job -- and your friends, those that you can. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Surround                    yourself with people of like minds that support each other.                    And that&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re going to have to                  do it, Kerry. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. Well, I have to agree with you. I also say on                  the positive side though, for all the work we&rsquo;ve been                  doing to awaken people, when the economy goes down, you&rsquo;re                  going to see people wake up real fast.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s                    right. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; You                    know.

They&rsquo;re looking for information. They&rsquo;re                  looking for leadership. They&rsquo;re looking for information                  that they can trust in a morass of misinformation, both deliberate                  and accidental, that they get on the news. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And more                    and more it seems that what we&rsquo;re able to provide                  is something that people consider to be very valuable.
