That&rsquo;s OK. It&rsquo;s                JERN-I-GAN.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. Jernigan. Rebecca is a radio host, hostess, from                  the middle of America. She&rsquo;s also a psychic intuitive                  and does readings for people. And I have called her after our                  conversation with Bill Deagle this morning to get some of the                  things she herself might be getting, to see how they might                  match up. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ahead of                    time she has not been told what Bill Deagle had to say. So,                    Rebecca, let&rsquo;s just put this on the record.                  And then you can call me back, and we can do it again after                  you&rsquo;ve heard the information.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R:&nbsp; Sounds wonderful, Kerry. I appreciate it. Well, actually,                  this particular... I call it a <em>dream</em>. They really                  aren&rsquo;t dreams. I call them my <em>visions-of-future</em>,                  or <em>future-time</em>, if you will... they&rsquo;re                  very distinctively different. And through the years I&rsquo;ve                  had very few of these. And most of them have been futuristic                  implications of things that have come to pass.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As an example,                    just to put this on record, before the Oklahoma bombing,                    I actually had a future-dream-vision of the Oklahoma bombing.                    It was extraordinarily unsettling. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t                  recognize what they were, until after the fact.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So that                    being said, the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been plagued                  with what I call these dreams, and &ldquo;plagued&rdquo; is                  a very good word to use. One in particular stands out, Kerry,                  that I will share with you, that had so many implications to                  it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was actually                    assisting people to go underground. There had been communities                    that had been put up underground, and I happened to run across                    one that hadn&rsquo;t been already occupied.                  I was assisting people to get underground to a place of safety. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Safety                    could be physical endangerment, can just be climatic changes.                    And when I say that, I&rsquo;m talking about politically,                  financially, all of those things. So the implications here                  were wide and varied. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do remember,                    before I went underground myself, that I was making sure                    that I was not being watched, that any of the, what I call                    the Big Brother cameras, were not watching, that other factions                    -- when I say &ldquo;factions&rdquo; it means                  like other species, other races, and other people &ndash; did                  not see where we had entered into this underground facility. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, interestingly                    enough, down in... this underground                  facility was broken apart into several different things.(Understand                  that this is a conceptual dream, not necessarily totally in                  its entirety factual or futuristic, because it does get discombobulated                  within the dreamtime.) But there were... there was a group                  of people that had been scarred, sickened, and illness, by                  nuclear fall-out. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was                    another group of people that had been contaminated with different                    contamination. They were all contaminated with... whether                  it be poisoning or biological warfare. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was another group of people that were what I had called                  people that had at one point had a lot of wealth, money, finances.                  They did not know how or what to do. They were totally helpless                  because they never had to worry about survival. You know, they                  simply just had everything, and did not know anything about                  how to take care of themselves or anything like that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then there                    was a group of people down there that were very self-sufficient,                    what I call the &ldquo;aware&rdquo; people.                  They were very aware. They were running around trying to assist                  people and awaken people that <em>all was not what it appeared                  to be.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was quite an extraordinary dream, inasmuch as there were                  many, many, many different things going on in the different                  compartments of this dream at the same time. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here in                    the middle, I was standing and I was observing all of this.                    I did note that there had been somebody trying to... that                  had actually found the location, and they were trying to get                  in. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in                    this location, there was some person that was inside this                    underground facility &ndash; again, this is just a kind                  of generic concept here -- that had the ability in their mind                  to neurologically disable these people, so they had no idea                  of where they were or what they were doing. They did feel like,                  to me, that they were not of this... of our human species,                  as we know it, anyway, for most of us... and had disabled                  them through their powers of their minds, so to speak. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So all                    of that being said, I just felt like it was very, very... in                  the not-so-distant future, that it was sitting right upon me. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There&rsquo;s a point of reference. That last big one for                  me I had, which was the Oklahoma bombing that happened -- and                  there was several others prior to that -- but it&rsquo;s usually                  a 2- to 4-week spread. Usually it&rsquo;s what happens when                  I have these types of dreams. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It takes                    a little bit for me to kind of pull them apart and put them                    in their proper perspective. And, unfortunately, most of                    the time it&rsquo;s the 20/20 hindsight where I go: <em>OK.                  Now I understand exactly what that meant. This is what this                  is about</em>.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. That&rsquo;s very valuable, Rebecca. Can we say                  where you&rsquo;re located? And the name of your radio show?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R:&nbsp; Yes. I&rsquo;m                  in Kansas City, and the name of the radio show is <em>Journeys with Rebecca</em>.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. Very good. Is there anything else you want to                  tell us about information you&rsquo;ve been getting recently?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R:&nbsp; The other information that I have been getting recently                  is that we are... And it&rsquo;s like a... I call                  it the &ldquo;nausea syndrome.&rdquo; I get really nauseated                  when a big event is getting ready to happen. I get very nauseated.                  And I get, nerve-wise, I get very jittery, which... I&rsquo;m                  not prone to that, you know. It&rsquo;s like the air is charged                  with events and happenings.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It really                    started when they started going through this bailout thing                    with the U.S. And it&rsquo;s with some of the things                  that&rsquo;s going on with that. Everything is so wrong about                  that. It&rsquo;s so wrong. And the core of my being is screaming.                  It just screams. It just screams<em>: It&rsquo;s wrong. It&rsquo;s                  wrong</em>, because the event is kind of like the catalyst                  for other events, and the dominoes are gonna start falling. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, unfortunately,                    I believe that the rest of the race, humanity, if you will,                    is gonna get lost in all of this. It almost feels like it&rsquo;s almost too late to do anything. That&rsquo;s                  the feelings, and that&rsquo;s the sense-impression that I                  get. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. Thank you for that. OK. Well, today I&rsquo;d                  like to say the date and the year. So if you could go ahead                  and say it for your location in the U.S., because I am calling                  you right now from Australia, where we are attending the <em>NEXUS                  Convention</em>. For us, it&rsquo;s Sunday, October 5, 2008,                  and its 8:30 in the morning. What time is it there?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R:&nbsp; It                is 5:30 p.m. on the 4th of October, 2008.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. Great. So I&lsquo;ll                    let you go, and you can take a listen to what we have just                    gotten from Bill Deagle and just published on our site. And,                    with your permission, we will publish this as well, to give                  people a little broader perspective from another intuitive.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R:&nbsp; That                    sounds wonderful.

If anybody has any comments or                    anything they&rsquo;d like to share, they can also use an                  email address to send it to the mailbox at <a href="https://www.journeyswithrebecca.com/" target="_blank">journeyswithrebecca.com</a>.                  Because this is about sharing information, about people being                  in the same space and working together as a community as much                  as we can, being that we&rsquo;re all over the globe literally,                  every one of us are.&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So that                    being said, I was absolutely blown away by the reference                    that Bill Deagle made to the Oklahoma bombings. What I heard                  when I was listening to that is there was a great awakening                  among intuitives, psychics, clairvoyants -- whatever you wish                  to call us all -- during that particular event in our history                  that was like a &ldquo;mass message,&rdquo; if you will.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thought that was pretty interesting that he shared that                  with me, Kerry. It really hit home with me, some of the things                  he was saying. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I look                    back on that particular last vision dream that I had, which                    was just a couple of weeks ago, by the way, I realized that                    it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;compartment&rdquo; where everything                  that he had been talking about -- which was the nuclear fallout                  with the one people; with the biological warfare, or you know,                  he called it the Avian flu. And there were those that I would                  call &ldquo;privileged&rdquo;, really weren&rsquo;t part of                  the bigger group of the underground, that would be sent to                  places of safety. That kind of thing. I realize that these                  were different factions of humanity and how they&rsquo;re kind                  of separated -- And you know, put it into a proper perspective                  for me. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    whole thing with listening to what Bill [Deagle] said really                    put into perspective other dreams that I&rsquo;ve had,                  prior to the 9/</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11 catastrophe                  that we had.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I didn&rsquo;t understand it at the time. And I didn&rsquo;t                  understand it until I actually listened to Bill. I had a dream                  about what I call &ldquo;false images&rdquo;, and these false                  images were images of explosions. And I never could understand                  what they were until, literally, today when I listened to Bill.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All that                    was triggered, and this dream -- and I never shared it to                    anyone -- but I kept dreaming about the &ldquo;false                  explosions&rdquo;, which was the 9/11 event, because they weren&rsquo;t                  what they appeared to be. I know we all watched it on television                  and all that -- and it still wasn&rsquo;t what it appeared                  to be. And still isn&rsquo;t. The truth has not been told on                  that one. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, interestingly                    enough, you put all this stuff together, and I believe that                    what Bill has seen, and how you guys commented on it all,                    is that it&rsquo;s absolutely, just unfathomably                  accurate.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got the shakes so bad as I was listening. It was that trigger                  mechanism, what I call when spirit comes in and recognizes                  truth, the spirit in me and the spirit outside itself connected. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of                    this is not, again, not to create additional fear and terror                    in people. It&rsquo;s really to effect a change. It&rsquo;s                  very much like quantum physics -- where you observe an event,                  it literally changes the event. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    more people that can help us on this in a positive manner,                    it can effect a change. And I have to agree, I don&rsquo;t                  believe that all these thing have to take place in the way                  that they are.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There will be some changes that have to take place, as we                  all know it. This just cannot go on the way that it is. You                  have to tear down the walls before you can get to the good                  foundation.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Humanity                    as a whole is a good foundation. It&rsquo;s those                  that have chosen to take over and to determine what&rsquo;s &ldquo;best&rdquo; for                  the rest of us, based on their own selfishness &ndash; greed                  and fear and control and manipulation. It&rsquo;s really what                  has changed humanity. And no more can we really tolerate any                  of that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That being                    said, you know... Certainly I have changed                  my particular show in which several times &ndash; I do my show                  once a week, Kerry, as you well know, once a week or at least                  once a month, and I&rsquo;m trying to push it up to every other                  week &ndash; I started up a title of it called <em>The State                  of the World,</em> in which I&rsquo;m hoping to bring people                  forward onto the show to share this information.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because                    there could come a time this information is no longer available                    if everything gets shut down. I certainly don&rsquo;t                  want The Powers That Be... rather, they certainly don&rsquo;t                  want us to be able to communicate the truth to each other,                  and for all of us to know we aren&rsquo;t in this alone.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know,                    it&rsquo;s about segregating us and keeping us in                  fear, keeping us from each other. And helping each other is                  the biggest thing.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Absolutely!                    What I wanted to tell you is that we are planning to interview                    Michael St.Clair and others of our contacts and witnesses                    to get their reactions to this information, and to see where                    they sort of fall on the spectrum of whether they psychically                    tapped into this thing or not, and whether they think this                    information might be misleading in any way. Because this,                  of course, is very important.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Very briefly,                    I have spoken with Michael St.Clair. He does not think that                    this is going to take place in this way, but I haven&rsquo;t                  gotten the whole run-down from his point of view. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, again, obviously Bill Deagle is speaking form his heart.                  He was on the verge of tears; he was pulling himself together                  in a very admirable way to talk to us today.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know,                    I&rsquo;m really grateful that you would come on                  and also share your vision before listening to what Bill Deagle                  had to say. So is there anything else you can tell us about                  your immediate reaction to what you heard?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R:&nbsp; Well                    my immediate reaction is that, that being said, when you                    commented on Michael St.Clair, my first reaction is what                    I feel, like, is that the timeline may be slightly off with                  what Bill Deagle has to say.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again,                    it just doesn&rsquo;t feel like the timeline is exactly                  right. But I do believe that some of these events will take                  place, whether they come in the manner which, like synchronicity,                  as far as what he was saying.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can tell                    you that I do believe that this whole bailout issue is really                    the &ldquo;first of the last&rdquo;, if that&rsquo;s                  how you want to word it. I truly believe that this has been                  very carefully planned. And what I heard was that it&rsquo;s                  actually been a plan that&rsquo;s been in the making for over                  30 years.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don&rsquo;t have any other information except for what I&rsquo;m                  being told by my own guidance, that they&rsquo;ve planned for                  a better part of 30 years. And they did show me some of the                  players, of course. Some of the players are political people                  that are no longer even of this Earth plane, but they were                  part of these meetings and planning stages and all of that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This has                    been going on for eons of time. So I would tell people, first                    of all, not to panic, and to try to be clear-headed and to                    really look at this. If there is a complete economic meltdown,                  it&rsquo;s going to affect everyone. It&rsquo;s not going to                  just affect the individual, </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So when you put yourself into that position, you have to think                  of it like that. You have to think of it as: <em>If I&rsquo;m                  experiencing this, everyone else is</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    rules no longer apply. Because I think that&rsquo;s                  going to be the toughest part for people to realize, Kerry. &nbsp;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These rules are not the same as they were. I mean, even from                  yesterday, the rules have changed, with all of these processes                  that are all in place, that are taking place economically,                  and socially and politically, across the globe.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;ve                    been saying for three years it&rsquo;s not been &ldquo;business                  as usual&rdquo;. I personally have tried to get that message                  out to people. And, you know, I was so grateful when I found                  you guys and found your site. I recommend it highly to everyone.                  So please go educate yourself! </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep an                    open mind, because I think this is the most important information.                    It&rsquo;s what the news is not telling you. You                  know, most everything we do get is... what most everyone                  will tell you... is just very watered-down bits and pieces                  of the truth. The rest of it is spoon-fed to them to make it                  sound good, to make it plausible and logical to most people.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right. OK. Well, we&rsquo;re                    going to go now because we have a lot of other people to                    try and contact in a short period of time.
