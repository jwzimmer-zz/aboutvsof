And people say it&rsquo;s impossible that all these things                  could happen to one person.

I&rsquo;ve seen it not only in myself, I&rsquo;ve                  seen it in others.

I&rsquo;ve had all kinds of threats.                  I&rsquo;ve had the Pindar come directly to me to say, you know,                  to be his replacement as the CEO of Earth, Inc. and the Druidic                  Council. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there&rsquo;s                    a lot of high-level Masons say: <em>Well,                    I haven&rsquo;t even heard of that.</em> Because they think                    they&rsquo;re the ascended ones.

They need to repent right now. And, as I say,                    if we can pray -- and this is something we have to do. And                    the most powerful thing we have is, I call it <em>fore-give.</em> The                  word <em>foregive</em> means to create. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To foregive                    means we need to pray for George Soros, who is behind the                    Blackstone Group and 9/11, and the current derivatives crises                    that&rsquo;s bringing the world down to a world and                  regional banks, and trade zones that are going to cause the                  death of millions and set the groundwork afoot for a pandemic. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because                    when starvation occurs, the population gets weakened, and                    it&rsquo;s the perfect groundwork, or cover, for a pandemic                  which they&rsquo;ve already weaponized.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Has                that already been released?

How long ago is it now? Gee... back in                  about 1995 I was praying and I was told by the angel that I                  was supposed to go to Europe. And I said: <em>Well, where?</em> And                  the Lord said: <em>You&rsquo;re going to go to Zurich.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I said: <em>Well,                      I don&rsquo;t know anybody in Zurich.</em> So                  I had some friends that were Canadians, that actually were                  in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the time and they had gone back                  to Austria, to Lake Constance.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I said: <em>Well,                      I&rsquo;ll contact them... the                    Santoses.</em> I said, you know:<em> You guys know Zurich?</em> [They                    said]: <em>Oh, yeah. We lived there are awhile and we love                    it.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I started going through and googling, you know, checking                  out things, trying to find out which organization. The Lord                  said: <em>You&rsquo;re supposed to contact these people here                  at Human Life International.</em> So I speak to God, literally,                  and he tells me.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I contact them. I call this guy and he calls me back from                  Zurich.

OK? That they had got gene bioengines, and                  they had actually resurrected the corpses of people that died                  of the H1N1 back in 1918, that they were paid for by the Rothschilds...

And they were drawing blood                  from women in sub-Saharan Africa, testing to see if they create                  antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin to sterilize                  them. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I had another 4 inches of documents that showed that AIDS                  was completely weaponized by cross-genetically engineering                  the Visna virus with other viruses.

It doesn&rsquo;t                    exist on this plane.

OK? So this idea that there is alternative timelines,                  I think is a deception, a very, very significant deception.                  Because it says that the world is a mechanistic Cartesian world                  that&rsquo;s created by energetics and we&rsquo;re just kind                  of like leaves that are pushed along by energy, space, and                  time, and we really don&rsquo;t have any choices to our future. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact,                    we actually ARE the Gods of this world.

And that&rsquo;s                  a very different thing. So, in other words, reality is created                  on this energetic plane by spirit. It&rsquo;s not the other                  way around. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Of                course.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the problem we&rsquo;re in. So,                  when you hear people saying that they&rsquo;ve had physical                  contact, the deception is very, very powerful. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;re                    right here now with mankind, as is said in the Eschaton that                    transcends time and space, to make a decision for <em>life</em>,                    whether this civilization is going to survive what&rsquo;s coming or it&rsquo;s                  going to be annihilated. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we&rsquo;re                    very close to that, and we can see the object-lesson of Israel                    as the final crux. Just look at the foreign policy and look                  at the financial policy.

Even though,                  you know, they&rsquo;ll say: <em>Well, we&rsquo;re communists</em> --                  the Israelis -- because they had the Russians there at the                  inception of the Israeli state.

Just take a city, like,                  let&rsquo;s say you had a city like Los Angeles and you took                  out 20 blocks with a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon, with a population                  kill of let&rsquo;s say 200,000. And California devolved into                  a state where there&rsquo;s no trucks going anywhere with any                  food. And this is a place where it&rsquo;s a breadbasket. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This state would be a seething caldron of death, and half                  the population would probably be dead within 30 days. Just                  because of the roving gangs shooting each other up, and trying                  to grab food that was left and getting trucks and whatever. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; It                    would be insane.

I said: <em>The guys who told me were special                  forces that worked at the Federal Center that told me this.</em> And                  they shocked me back in &rsquo;97 when they told me this stuff.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yeah.                And all of this is being modeled as well. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah.

Because when they bring it out, the next thing is: <em>Oh,                  that wasn&rsquo;t too bad.

That&rsquo;s                  totally against the Constitution. Right? They&rsquo;re still                  federalizing. The city of Detroit&rsquo;s federalized, the                  city of New Orleans. This is a violation of Federal and State                  law.
