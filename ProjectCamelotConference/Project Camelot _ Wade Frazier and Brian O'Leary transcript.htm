It&rsquo;s Friday the 27th of March,                  2009, different time zones in different parts of the world.                  I&rsquo;m in Europe. Kerry is in Los Angeles. Brian is in Ecuador.                Wade, you&rsquo;re in Seattle? Is that right?<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="wade_frazier.jpg" width="500" height="431" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right"></font></p>                <p class="style7">Wade Frazier (WF): Yes. </p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re delighted, Wade, to be talking with                  you. Wade Frazier, like Brian O&rsquo;Leary, who we had the                  great pleasure of meeting and talking with at length in Ecuador                  back in January, is a veteran free-energy activist. </p>                <p class="style7">Brian O&rsquo;Leary was in the astronaut                  program, and is himself a veteran free-energy activist. He&rsquo;s                  done a lot to investigate phenomena on the fringes of mainstream                  science, is a very accomplished speaker, has been everywhere                  and knows everyone, and we're very proud to feature him as                  one of the Witnesses on our site. </p>                <p class="style7">But not so many people will have heard of Wade Frazier. His                  website, which is called <u><a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/home.htm" target="_blank">ahealedplanet.net</a></u>,                  has 1,200 pages. It is encyclopedic in its scope and it tells                  Wade&rsquo;s story of a non-stop running skirmish with the                  whole issue of free energy. And you're taking to heart this,                  as a cause, which is very much what Brian O&rsquo;Leary has                  done. </p>                <p class="style7">Some people think that free energy is all about an inventor                  sitting in a garage or a basement with a bunch of electronics                  and magnets, and getting a little machine to work that will                  light up a light bulb and everyone thinks: <em>Gee Whiz! This                  is a neat little device here. It&rsquo;s an alternative to                  having a windmill in my garden.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And this is very far from the point, because free energy is                  at the hub of so many issues that are connected with how our                  planet is run and controlled, that it really is one of the                  very central places to start. </p>                <p class="style7">Wade, and what he has to say about free energy, needs to be                  heard. It&rsquo;s a very, very important story. And, what I&rsquo;m                  looking forward to here in the next hour or so is a conversation                  primarily with Wade and Brian O&rsquo;Leary, to talk about                  why free energy is something that we should care about, why                  it should be politicized, why it affects every corner of our                  lives. </p>                <p class="style7">And for those people who have ventured into this area with                  practical intentions, it&rsquo;s proved to be quite a dangerous                  path for them to tread because they can really interfere with                  the agendas of others. </p>                <p class="style7">This is really what I would like to talk about. It isn&rsquo;t                  going to be a technical conversation. It&rsquo;s going to be                  a conversation about the paradigm shift that&rsquo;s necessary                  for free energy to be ushered into this world in the 21st century. </p>                <p class="style7">And I wonder, Wade, what it is about free energy that has                  made this virtually your life mission? Why is it so important?                  Why have you devoted so much of your time and your soul to                  this cause?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Thank you, Bill. As you know, it                  was a very long story that began when I was a child. I&rsquo;m                  over fifty now, but my journey in the alternative energy area                  began <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#funeral" target="_blank">when                  I was a teenager</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">I was groomed to be a scientist from a very                  young age. And when I was sixteen years old, one of my professional                  mentors <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#glimpse" target="_blank">had invented an engine</a> which was considered the best                  for powering an automobile. It created quite a lot of interest                  from the federal government in the United States. In fact,                  they spent millions of dollars developing and analyzing it. </p>                <p class="style7">But also it never went anywhere. And, in fact,                  the inventor was told that if he thought his engine was                  going to make the internal combustion engine obsolete, he should                  start making his funeral plans. And so this was my                  introduction to this whole area, back in 1974.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; That was when you were still a teenager, Wade. Is                  that right?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Yes. I was sixteen                  years old, and at that time I had the dream of changing the                  energy paradigm in this world. At age sixteen I had no idea                  what I could do about it, but it was a dream that I had. And                  so then I continued my science studies. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, I think very importantly... In fact,                  most of the people that I&rsquo;m aware of in this field, we                  generally have <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/journey.htm#mystical" target="_blank">some kind of                  mystical orientation</a> because we&rsquo;ve                  had some experiences that opened our paradigm to beyond                  the &ldquo;scientistic&rdquo; paradigm,                  and saw a broader picture. Fellow travelers                  in this field, I think most of them would say, that that was                  probably key.</p>                <p class="style7">Anyway, so... I then went to college and had                  some <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#voice" target="_blank">strange experiences</a> that                  changed my studies from chemistry to accounting. Then I got                  out of school and went to work in Los Angeles and <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#believing" target="_blank">did                  my CPA thing</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">After several years of kind of being frustrated                  in the corporate world, I had another very strange set of events, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#voice2" target="_blank">capped                  with a paranormal experience</a>, that <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#hitting" target="_blank">led                  me directly into a company up here in Seattle</a>. This was 1986. They were marketing                  energy conservation equipment here in Seattle. Basically it&rsquo;s                  a <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy1.htm#new" target="_blank">heating system that would save                  80% of your heating costs</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">I joined the company as it was actually being bludgeoned out                  of existence by the energy interests up here in the Northwest.                  Because of that childhood dream and my background, even though                  the company was destroyed, the founder couldn&rsquo;t get rid                  of me. So I ended up following him <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#chasing" target="_blank">across                  the country to Boston</a>,                  and then that&rsquo;s when we started pursuing free energy,                  if you will. </p>                <p class="style7">The technology that we were pursuing was actually marrying                  the heat pump that Dennis Lee, the guy in Seattle, was marketing,                  with the engine that my old mentor developed. [laughs] We were                  actually trying to marry those together. Then we ended up in                  Ventura, California, which is where I was raised, and then                  started making a lot of noise. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, my partner, Dennis -- he&rsquo;s                  the <em>Indiana Jones</em> of alternative energy. He&rsquo;s                  been behind bars, survived murder attempts. Currently                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paths.htm#ftc" target="_blank">the Federal Trade                  Commission is trying to shut him down</a>.</p>                <p class="style7">Anyway, in Ventura then, we really got the attention of the                  people who I will say manage the energy paradigm on this planet.                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#ten" target="_blank">We received an offer in Boston</a> and then we received another                  one in California. My partner was <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#offer" target="_blank">offered                  a billion dollars</a>                  to fold up the operation and go away. The offer was made by                  a CIA man who said he represented European interests. </p>                <p class="style7">A month after my partner declined their offer,                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#jail" target="_blank">he found himself                  in jail with a million-dollar bail</a>. The                  man who arrested him got promoted to be in charge of the jail,                  a couple weeks later, and got an award, and all these                  kinds of things. </p>                <p class="style7">So anyway, it was quite a radicalizing experience                  for me because they eventually took their masks off in Ventura                  to me and <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#faces" target="_blank">admitted                  to my face</a> that their job was to take us out. So they did                  their best, and it was actually a pretty good job. They wrecked                  many, many lives. </p>                <p class="style7">I ended up leaving Ventura back in 1990 after a couple of                  us essentially <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#it" target="_blank">sprung Dennis from                  jail</a>. He ended up only spending                  two years behind bars. And then I spent the next twelve years                  trying to figure out what I had just lived through and realized                  that probably everything I thought I knew <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/lies.htm" target="_blank">was                  probably not true</a>.</p>                <p class="style7">And so then, the result of those twelve years                  of research<strong>...</strong> I                  don&rsquo;t know, I probably read a quarter-million pages of                  material or something like that, and again, turned it into                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/home.htm" target="_blank">the                  website that I have today</a>.</p>                <p class="style7">And yes, Bill, it&rsquo;s a thing that the                  energy situation... Humanity rides on top of it. In fact, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/abund.htm#economics" target="_blank">humanity                  always has</a>. Life on Earth, the human journey, it&rsquo;s                  all... the energy situation <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/roots.htm" target="_blank">is                  at the root of all that</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">And so an energy scarcity has defined the                  human journey. Even though I live in the richest, most powerful                  nation in history and the average American consumes <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/abund.htm#eighty" target="_blank">eighty                  times the calories that go into their diets</a>, we&rsquo;re                  still a scarcity-based society. </p>                <p class="style7">The increasing level of energy use that the                  West has enjoyed has definitely transformed our society in                  many ways. It took a lot of old social structures and made                  them obsolete. Slavery began with early civilization                  and ended with early industrialization. The liberation of women...                  all these things. There&rsquo;s an essentially economic basis                  that underlies that, which is powered by energy. </p>                <p class="style7">And what we found was that there&rsquo;s people who manage                  the energy situation on a global basis. It can be debated who                  they are, what their motives are. Could they just be protecting                  their market? I tend to believe that they are maintaining their                  global power structure. That&rsquo;s my conclusion. </p>                <p class="style7">And again, I&rsquo;ve run into fellow travelers since then,                  Brian among them, who... we&rsquo;ve generally come to about                  the same vicinity of understanding the problem, the issues,                  and the opportunities and what&rsquo;s possible. </p>                <p class="style7">So I&rsquo;m aware, and I think Brian is, and most of us are                  aware that there are energy technologies. You know, the guy                  tinkering around in his garage, if he ever really comes up                  with something, then he does attract the attention of the <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paradigm.htm#gc" target="_blank">global                  controllers</a>, I&rsquo;ll call them. </p>                <p class="style7">And in fact, people who poke their nose into this pretty deeply...                  Again, it&rsquo;s risky business. There&rsquo;s a lot of people                  who have had their lives wrecked, or they&rsquo;re dead, or                  they&rsquo;re silenced somehow. </p>                <p class="style7">But some people, like <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/journey.htm#greer" target="_blank">Steven                    Greer</a> who&rsquo;s a warrior --                  or Dennis -- he ended up banging on the front door of the White                  House and all this kind of stuff. And eventually Greer interacted                  with at least a faction of this global control organization.                  They admitted that they&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/hooked.htm#payoff" target="_blank">paid                  one hundred billion dollars</a>                  in &ldquo;quiet                  money&rdquo; over the last couple generations to put the lid                  on &ldquo;disruptive technologies&rdquo;. </p>                <p class="style7">And I would say that free energy is probably                  at the top of that list, although my understanding is, from                  people very close to me who&rsquo;ve witnessed some of these                  things, that antigravity... the people that you interview on                  your Project Camelot site. A lot of the things that I hear                  them say are things that I&rsquo;ve                  also had experience of. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, we kind of come to the same general vicinity. But                  my message, and I think Brian&rsquo;s... essentially there&rsquo;s                  a big picture to see here, and the energy situation is really                  the keystone of the thing. </p>                <p class="style7">And, as far as why free energy and what it can bring about                  seems to be so unimaginable in our societies. I don&rsquo;t                  know how conspiratorial that&rsquo;s been, because eventually,                  after all my years of study and experience, etcetera, and being                  introduced to <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/roots.htm#fuller" target="_blank">Bucky Fuller&rsquo;s work</a>, I came to realize                  what these ideologies have <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paradigm.htm#dominant" target="_blank">that                  keep us from seeing the big picture</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">They all are scarcity-based and so they all                  have a scarcity-based component to them. And in fact they also                  have a component where, if you give your allegiance to this                  certain ideology, then it feeds you. And so you&rsquo;re very                  reluctant to give up your belief system.</p>                <p class="style7">So free energy, etcetera... there can be an abundance-based                  foundation of our society, which... the human journey&rsquo;s never                  seen that. So it&rsquo;s something that really... <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paradigm.htm#peeling" target="_blank">it&rsquo;s                  difficult to wrap your head around</a>. It takes a long time to                  do that. </p>                <p class="style7">And what I found is you have to really lay                  aside all your conditioning of your <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paradigm.htm#dominant" target="_blank">scarcity-based                  kinds of ideologies</a> like                  capitalism, or nationalism, or a lot of the scientism, the                  rationalist / materialist paradigm. All these things are very                  subtly scarcity-based. Some are less subtle than                  others, but in the end that&rsquo;s what they have all in common.</p>                <p class="style7">And so, what free energy ends up doing is you can actually                  replace that scarcity assumption <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/abund.htm#abundance" target="_blank">with                  an abundance assumption</a>.                  It&rsquo;s a shift that would be... we&rsquo;ve never seen                  it before. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, in fact all of the epochal so-called                  revolutions of the human journey -- the <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#megafauna" target="_blank">super-predator                  revolution</a>,                  or the <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#early" target="_blank">domestication revolution</a>, or the <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#industrial" target="_blank">industrialization                  revolution</a>                  -- essentially humanity was able to tap into another energy                  source and control a bunch more energy in a way that was able                  to free up people beyond survival.</p>                <p class="style7">I live in the United States and it&rsquo;s been a pretty comfortable                  existence to be an American, even though most Americans today                  are wondering if they&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/savings.htm#crisis" target="_blank">going                  to lose their job next week</a>.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Walking some of our listeners through                  this world that you describe as a thought experiment... Supposing                  there was a little black box in every house and in every truck,                  or in every plane there&rsquo;s a slightly larger black box,                  and every power station has a really big black box. And this                  black box just gave as much output as one needed at zero cost                  once you&rsquo;ve actually got this thing there. How does the                  world change? I&rsquo;d love to ask Brian&rsquo;s view.</p>                <p class="style7"><img src="brian_o_leary_sm.jpg" width="190" height="232" hspace="10" align="left">Brian O&rsquo;Leary (B&rsquo;OL): &nbsp;Hi. Hello                  everybody. It&rsquo;s good to be talking with you again, Bill,                  and to hear you&rsquo;re reading Wade, because certainly both                  Wade and I have had parallel pathways of discovery, of stepping                  outside of the box of mainstream thinking. It&rsquo;s taken                  quite a while, and it can be a very painful process. It&rsquo;s                  a process that the general public now is, I think, beginning                  to awaken to.</p>                <p class="style7">In answer to your question, Bill, imagine a world where we                  have these, say, little 10-kilowatt power-packs that you can                  put in your circuit-breaker box or under the hood of your car.                  The world would change overnight. Let&rsquo;s say we made two                  or three billion of these... </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that I necessarily advocate doing                  this under the system we now have. And that, of course, then                  begs the question of political and economic control, and some                  of the reasons why this technology has been so suppressed.                  And believe me, Wade and I have personally had many, many experiences                  around that since our own awareness became more pronounced. </p>                <p class="style7">So what I see happening is that this new world -- as long                  as the governments of the world and the corporations of the                  world change systemically--and that&rsquo;s been my plea... </p>                <p class="style7">Gosh, on <a href="https://brianoleary.info" target="_blank">my website</a> I just posted <a href="https://www.brianoleary.info/Universal Appeal to Create a World of Sustainable Abundance.html" target="_blank">a                    letter to Obama</a>. It was                  an open appeal, basically, to please address the systemic changes                  we need so that we can usher in some of these new technologies                  in a very benign way, that we can do things                  differently, that we don&rsquo;t want Dick                  Cheney running this one, too. Nor do we want the current US                  government, such as it is, to be running this one. </p>                <p class="style7">Obviously these technologies are a big threat                  to vested interests, whether you&rsquo;re a scientist... And                  we know that the whole history of science is just riddled with                  denial of new developments, whether it was during the Copernican                  revolution, the time of Keppler, Galileo. The <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#wright" target="_blank">Wright                  brothers</a>                  -- their initial flight, the reporter that reported it was                  far from its position and <em>Scientific                  American</em> about a year later ran an editorial, a scathing                  editorial, <a href="https://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/i/Wrights/library/WrightSiAm1.html" target="_blank">denying                  that aviation ever existed</a> - because it                  wasn&rsquo;t reported!</p>                <p class="style7">Historically we can look at the structure of                  scientific revolutions -- <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/medicine.htm#introduction" target="_blank">Thomas                  Kuhn&rsquo;s book</a> -- and I know Wade is acutely aware                  of this. We&rsquo;ve both been studying this kind of thing                  about paradigm shifts many times, and it&rsquo;s now happening                  once again in spades. And as Wade points out, the energy picture                  in our time is probably more important than anything else. </p>                <p class="style7">And so we have to kind of break this down and look at this                  from a sociologist&rsquo;s point of view as: <em>Who&rsquo;s                  doing the suppressing and why are they doing the suppressing?</em> And                  what you find when you really look at these things -- because                  Wade and I have already seen for ourselves numerous demonstrations                  of proof-of-concept of the new energy technologies -- why                  are they so violently suppressed?</p>                <p class="style7">So you have this unwitting alliance among scientists, corporatists,                  governments. Even progressives - people who otherwise might                  want to embrace this possibility - even the progressives are                  not looking at these things, and that, of course, is the saddest                  part.</p>                <p class="style7">And so, in our own way Wade and I kind of in parallel discovered                  that there is a whole process. It&rsquo;s an emotional process.                  It&rsquo;s a sociological one, where people who are trying                  to protect their own interests seem to dig their heels in even                  more than they otherwise would have, in order to protect their                  careers or their vested interests.</p>                <p class="style7">So the scientists... most                  of the mainstream scientific community, just like in the early                  days of aviation, are denying the possibility of free energy                  and will go out of their way to debunk it. And there certainly                  have been many, many examples of that.</p>                <p class="style7">But <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/radleft.htm#myths" target="_blank">it&rsquo;s not only the scientists</a>. It&rsquo;s the government                  itself. It&rsquo;s the progressives. It&rsquo;s... The people                  that call themselves <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/purpose.htm#environmentalists">environmentalists</a> are obviously not radical                  enough. They&rsquo;re thinking of things like solar energy                  and wind energy. </p>                <p class="style7">But, you know, one of the disappointments I came to, back                  in the &rsquo;70s when I was working for Morris Udall... He                  was a congressman who was running for president, and he wanted                  to develop renewable clean energy, and in those days my only                  horizon of awareness was solar, wind, the so-called traditional                  renewables. </p>                <p class="style7">But then a later study, if you look at the cost and benefits,                  you find that solar and wind is materials-intensive; it&rsquo;s                  land-intensive; it&rsquo;s capital-intensive. We&rsquo;re talking                  about tens of trillions of dollars to invest in a whole new                  system of solar or wind to provide the world with its power,                  and that&rsquo;s just not going to fly, especially in today&rsquo;s                  economic climate. </p>                <p class="style7">We need to be smarter about this. We need to look into the                  21st century, towards those technologies that will truly give                  us a clean energy society. </p>                <p class="style7">And my own discovery... During the 1980s and &rsquo;90s I                  traveled the world and visited some of the best and brightest                  inventors and wrote some books about this. And I finally came                  to my <em>Ah-ha!</em> that indeed this could change the world                  if it were implemented properly. </p>                <p class="style7">So this whole new energy activism that Wade                  and I share is a great enthusiasm, but there&rsquo;s also this                  undercurrent of sadness about how our planet, and almost all                  of nature, is being destroyed by a cancerous humanity that                  is not awakening to these possibilities, which could then buy                  us a little time while we really try to reform our culture                  and do the systemic changes that we really need to do.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Brian, thank you. That&rsquo;s a wonderfully articulate                  presentation of the problem and presentation of the challenge. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;d like to ask Wade if you could tell the second-hand                  story of this free energy pioneer, whose credibility you feel                  is total, who you said was shown by &ldquo;The Powers That                  Be&rdquo; what technology they actually have. And it was explained                  to him why they&rsquo;re keeping this secret. This is a story                  that people need to hear.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Yes. During my years I came in contact                  with quite an interesting group of people. And anyway, one                  of my very close associates, yes, was shown -- in a very remote                  setting -- some                  of the technologies that exist today on Earth: <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#underground" target="_blank">antigravity,                  free energy</a>. These technologies exist, you know. </p>                <p class="style7">And for me, I put my jigsaw puzzle together                  of the picture at least that I see from all of this. And the                  people who have really been out there -- I mean, it&rsquo;s                  not for the timid -- and the people who have survived                  anyway being out there and come back to tell what they&rsquo;ve                  experienced... And the picture that I see is that the people                  who are calling the shots on the planet <em>like </em>calling                  the shots on the planet, and they don&rsquo;t want to give                  that up. </p>                <p class="style7">Energy independence would truly make everybody                  independent. And so, we are so energy dependent. We are so                  dependent on other people providing us our energy. If we actually                  had our own source of it, the very centralized, very steeply                  hierarchical political-economic-social systems we have in the                  world would become obsolete. </p>                <p class="style7">For instance, this friend of mine who had this demonstration...                  the people who are currently addicted to the power that they                  have over the planet, they will do whatever it takes to maintain                  it. And the technologies they have are <em>way</em> beyond                  what is on the market today. I mean, it&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/abund.htm#trek" target="_blank">Star Trek</a> </em>kind                  of stuff.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Wade, did your friend tell you what it was exactly                  that he was shown? And was he given an explanation for why                  he was being shown this? And I&rsquo;m assuming he must have                  been given an explanation why this technology was being withheld                  and not being released. </p>                <p class="style7">Kerry, it might be better, to help Wade, if you could take                  the lead on this, because Wade is having trouble understanding                  my gentleman&rsquo;s accent here.</p>                <p class="style7">Kerry Cassidy (KC):&nbsp; [laughs] I know. That&rsquo;s OK.                  I&rsquo;m sorry about that. Wade, what he wants to know, and                  I&rsquo;d love to know myself, what exactly was the technology                  that your friend was shown?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; At least <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#underground" target="_blank">free                    energy, and at least antigravity</a>.                  OK? Those were two of the technologies that were definitely                  shown off. OK? And I almost didn&rsquo;t want                  to know a whole lot more because the knowledge can be considered                  dangerous to have. But there was a host of exotic technologies                  that were demonstrated, free energy and antigravity probably                  most prominently.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; You say that technology was <em>demonstrated</em>.                  In other words, did they see craft, for example?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; This was in an underground setting,                  so they definitely didn&rsquo;t want to fly anything around,                  or at least the antigravity demonstration wasn&rsquo;t                  something like a mothership. It was pretty small. </p>                <p class="style7">But anyway, I&rsquo;m saying these technologies were demonstrated.                  And again, the people who demonstrated them admitted that they                  do not have the freedom to essentially come above-board and                  bring this stuff to the world. And they also, though, said                  that they would like to bring it out, but it&rsquo;s not safe.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Why was your friend shown this? Why him?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Oh, why was my friend...? OK. So, my fr... Boy!                  This is where I have to be kind of careful. The circles I run                  around in -- I have run around in; I&rsquo;m kind of semi-retired                  from this stuff -- but again, they go banging on the front                  door of the White House, go banging on the front door of the                  Pentagon, go banging on the front door of some corporations. </p>                <p class="style7">Sometimes you get to meet the wizard. This person was high                  profile at the time. They were banging on the doors. They were                  stirring things up and they got a show.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Can you tell us what aspect of, or do you know,                  what part of the military was involved in showing this stuff?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; This person does not even know who                  it was who showed it to him.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Fascinating. OK. Very interesting.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; This was a very, very secure operation. So secure...</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And where was the underground base located? Can                  you say the state?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; I am not sure. I believe it was in                  the United States. This person does not know where. They were                  taken there blindfolded. And they get to take the blindfold                  off, and they&rsquo;re underground                  someplace, and there&rsquo;s these people demonstrating something.                  And they&rsquo;re talking to you and they know who you are.                  And they&rsquo;re saying: <em>Hey,                  we've got some things to show you</em>. It was that kind of                  setting.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Until this person wants to talk publicly                  about it, I am not going to reveal too much information about                  it. Stuff that people have disclosed publicly, then I will. </p>                <p class="style7">So, again, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#offer" target="_blank">Dennis                    got a billion-dollar offer</a>.                  When I was with Dennis, we had some very interesting interactions                  with some of these groups. And again, as I recall, Bill calls                  them <em>white-hats</em> and <em>black-hats</em>. And we had                  encounters with both groups. OK? </p>                <p class="style7">And we would get periodically contacted by                  the white-hat group. It was very cryptic. All of a                  sudden you&rsquo;re                  working in the office late one night and you get a telephone                  call. And it&rsquo;s like: <em>&quot;Keep up the good work.&quot;</em> This                  kind of thing. And so you&rsquo;re kind of wondering: <em>&quot;What                  was that all about?&quot;</em> [laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">So anyway, all I know is that during my days with Dennis,                  we were extremely high profile. And in fact I have written,                  because it&rsquo;s a little safer to disclose it now, but when                  I was with him in &rsquo;96, &rsquo;97 we were subjected to                  an <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/other.htm#darker" target="_blank">extremely elaborate sting operation                  that was trying to entrap us</a>. And again, it was people who said they were going to give                  us a bunch of money to make things happen. </p>                <p class="style7">About a year later I heard <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#bearden" target="_blank">Tom                    Bearden</a> talking about a very                  similar situation, saying how: <em>&quot;Yes, they say they&rsquo;re                  going to come and give you all this money, but it&rsquo;s dirty                  money, and as soon as you sign for the money they whisk you                  off to prison.&quot;</em></p>                <p class="style7">And it wasn&rsquo;t until... actually it was last fall that                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/savings.htm#inning" target="_blank">I started writing about the                  financial meltdown</a> and my interactions                  with some of these players and I came to slowly realize that                  we were being set up, and in fact in almost the same kind of                  operation that Bearden described. </p>                <p class="style7">It was extremely elaborate,                  with penthouses in Manhattan and sovereign nations being                  involved. It was very elaborate. And I really don&rsquo;t know.                  What was real and what was fabricated? I don&rsquo;t know.                  How many people were duped and how many were in on it? I&rsquo;ll                  probably never know. </p>                <p class="style7">But I do know that we were being set up, whoever all these                  people are. Again, the Federal Trade Commission right now <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paths.htm#ftc" target="_blank">is                  trying to shut down Dennis</a>. I haven&rsquo;t been involved with                  Dennis since the &rsquo;90s, but they&rsquo;re trying to shut                  him down right now. </p>                <p class="style7">And when they <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#mr" target="_blank">clobbered                    us in Ventura</a>, when they <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy1.htm#run" target="_blank">clobbered                  him in Washington</a>, or they were about to <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#chasing" target="_blank">clobber                  us in Boston</a>,                  it&rsquo;s usually the government that&rsquo;s wielding the                  public club. But they&rsquo;re just taking orders. I                  mean, they&rsquo;re not the guys really in charge of the operation. </p>                <p class="style7">And that&rsquo;s when Dennis                  got the billion-dollar offer to fold up his tents and go away,                  that was not delivered... Oh yes, <em>CIA representing European                  interests</em>, or at                  least that&rsquo;s what they said. So that&rsquo;s... There&rsquo;s                  your private/government, quasi- kind of thing going on. And                  then, again, the government comes and shuts you down. </p>                <p class="style7">The sting operation that we were being subjected to, at the                  same time that I get a letter from our phone company that the                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/other.htm#subpoena" target="_blank">Justice Department had subpoenaed                  our phone records</a> and gagged                  them for six months from notifying us that they had, etcetera. </p>                <p class="style7">You&rsquo;re kind of wondering who all is involved,                  and how many different ways they&rsquo;re coming at you. And                  I saw that in Seattle in &rsquo;86. I saw that in Ventura.                  We were subject to kind of a whole new level of the game when                  I was with Dennis back in &rsquo;96, &rsquo;97. So anyway,                  again...</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Why do you think that was, though? Was it because                  you guys were so close?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Why that we got the attention that we did?</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Oh, because my partner, he... Again,                  when I met him in &rsquo;86, he was selling equipment. He                  was actually <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy1.htm#run" target="_blank">making an economic                  impact in the marketplace</a>.                  And again, the closer you get to the market, the greater the                  resistance is going to be. </p>                <p class="style7">So, yes, a guy tinkering in his garage, they                  just... they leave him... They&rsquo;ll keep tabs on him, but                  they&rsquo;re                  going to pretty much leave him alone unless he really comes                  up with something. Then he&rsquo;ll get some attention. </p>                <p class="style7">But we had a national effort going on. He <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy1.htm#sales" target="_blank">sold                    quite a few millions of dollars</a> of his heat pump. And                    he was trying to carpet Puget Sound with these heat pumps                    which was... One calculation was the local electric company                    was going to lose something like twenty billion dollars in                    revenues over the next twenty years. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Wade, when you say the white-hats were trying to                  show you this technology and they would call you up late at                  night and encourage you, do you know anything more about who                  the white-hats were? And did your friend actually ever have                  any kind of meetings with those white-hats? Were they military?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll say this. I described                  the underground situation, and we would get called, and then                  we actually did get the suave fa&ccedil;ade of the black-hats,                  offering us a billion dollars, and then I&rsquo;m                  sure they were behind what happened to us in Ventura. I do                  listen. And again, for instance, Steven Greer has interacted                  quite a bit in these arenas, and the picture that he has developed                  of what he&rsquo;s                  seen, I pretty much think he&rsquo;s right. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, in fact when they mentioned the hundred                  billion dollars in &ldquo;quiet money&rdquo;, I was going: <em>&quot;Well,                  that makes perfect sense.&quot;</em> Because just in my                  journey I&rsquo;ve                  run into quite a few inventors who had been bought out, threatened,                  killed, this kind of thing. And when I heard that, a hundred                  billion dollars in quiet money, it made perfect sense. </p>                <p class="style7">Brian&rsquo;s friend, <a href="https://www.nomorefakenews.com/index.php" target="_blank">John                    Rappoport</a>, he said there&rsquo;s                  eight economic cartels on the planet that kind of divvied up                  the world economy. I won&rsquo;t deny that, because I&rsquo;ve                  seen similar activities taking place in <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/medicine.htm" target="_blank">medicine</a>, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/lies.htm#big" target="_blank">media</a>,                  these kinds of things.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Wade, can you talk about the white-hats, though?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; I will talk about the white-hats.                  So, it&rsquo;s                  interesting. I have one person I encountered once who was abducted,                  drugged, and put into an insane asylum. And when they were                  in this asylum -- and it was a way to keep him quiet -- there                  were kind of white-hat people in the asylum who were kind of                  looking out for him. I&rsquo;m sure you guys have encountered                  this in some of the things I&rsquo;ve read on your site, where                  this kind of thing goes on. So there are these kinds of surreptitious                  white-hat people. </p>                <p class="style7">And I don&rsquo;t know exactly how that structure                  operates, but my understanding is that the, let&rsquo;s say                  two- to three-hundred people who are kind of the policy-makers                  for the world economy... I would say that thirty years ago                  it was a very small fraction of them, like five percent, or                  maybe just a few here and there, who were kind of not really                  sure they liked the program any longer.</p>                <p class="style7">Several years ago <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/journey.htm#cabal" target="_blank">I                    heard Greer say that it&rsquo;s almost                  50/50 now</a>, to where the so-called white-hats... I don&rsquo;t                  know how white those hats are but I believe that there&rsquo;s                  a definite fracture in that structure, to where a lot of them                  realize that we&rsquo;re going to turn the Earth into a cinder                  on the path we&rsquo;re going. And so, they don&rsquo;t like                  that program. They have grandchildren and this kind of thing. </p>                <p class="style7">And so I think there has been a fracturing happen because                  the game&rsquo;s getting pretty scary for them and so they                  don&rsquo;t want it. So I don&rsquo;t know how white those                  hats are. But I believe that what my friend was shown in the                  underground setting was some faction of that disenchanted half.                  That is my perception.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So you believe that these people basically took                  care of your operation in Ventura. They closed it down, in                  essence. Right?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Oh yes. In fact, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#deputy" target="_blank">when                    they raided us</a> I was twenty-nine, young and na&iuml;ve,                    and thirteen armed deputies come in and kick us out of the                    buildings. And then they ransack our chief researcher&rsquo;s                    office, strip it out to the walls, and then didn&rsquo;t                    start the so-called &ldquo;official                    search&rdquo; for                  several hours later, said they never were in the room... except                  the researcher and one of our machinists, who was out behind                  the building, were able to actually see into the building and                  watch them ransacking the office. So this was when they first                  raided us. </p>                <p class="style7">So at that moment we realized that this had nothing to do                  with trying to see if we&rsquo;re committing crimes or not.                  I mean, they were committing the crimes right off the bat.                  Anyway, at that moment we realized that... I mean, I realized                  that definitely this had nothing to do with trying to protect                  the public or anything like that. </p>                <p class="style7">And then, for me though, it was a thing of...                  It wasn&rsquo;t                  until I was on the witness stand -- and Dennis was in leg irons                  and with a million-dollar bail -- and the prosecution is actually                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#faces" target="_blank">making faces at                  me as I&rsquo;m on the witness stand</a>. I mean,                  in kind of a Stalinist show-trial atmosphere. In fact                  the guy making faces at me was the guy who was in charge of                  the jail that Dennis was in. </p>                <p class="style7">And then at that moment, that was essentially                  my radicalizing moment, where a twelve-year journey of gradual                  disillusionment, etcetera, sort of came to a head for me and                  I kind of: <em>&quot;Ah-ha!&quot;</em> That                  was my big <em>Ah-ha!</em> moment, sitting                  on the witness stand where they&rsquo;re making faces at me                  as I&rsquo;m testifying.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Wade, I&rsquo;d like to go over to Brian... what                  you can say about how the world needs to change in order to                  accept free energy and whether you think that there&rsquo;s                  actually any hope at the moment for that happening? </p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Very good question, Kerry, and I wish I                  could answer it simply, because who knows what The Powers That                  Be are doing in quiet session right now.</p>                <p class="style7">What I can say is that the concepts are there. There&rsquo;s                  a very clear possibility we can develop these things, and there                  are many of us who&rsquo;ve been advocating it for a long time.                  It seems like the political climate hasn&rsquo;t really changed. </p>                <p class="style7">On the other hand, the public is getting really                  pissed off at what&rsquo;s happening. Certainly the economic                  demise we&rsquo;re                  all going through right now is perhaps a metaphor or symbol,                  an archetype, for what could happen in the energy area, that                  even the protestors -- the Bill McKibbens of the world                  or the so-called free thinkers about Peak Oil or global warming,                  whether it&rsquo;s James Hansen or <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/hooked.htm#heinberg" target="_blank">Richard                  Heinberg</a> or all                  of these other people who have advocated radical change --                  still do not embrace the possibility of free energy.</p>                <p class="style7">So even though some of us, Wade and I and a number of others,                  have been attempting to educate some of these more visible                  progressive people about the possibility of free energy...                  and I&rsquo;ve even had conversations with Congressman Dennis                  Kucinich about it and he did carefully listen. He did acknowledge                  it. He did want to introduce legislation to support the research                  and development on it and make this publicly more visible. </p>                <p class="style7">Even though all of these things have been acknowledged and                  communicated, the fact remains that the consensus among the                  so-called progressives is still a complete denial about the                  possibility of free energy. </p>                <p class="style7">And that, to me, was the most astounding discovery I made                  that -- having done almost two decades ago my world travels                  to find out for myself as a scientist that indeed these concepts                  are very real; there are many, many different parallel technologies,                  any one, or some of which could do the trick -- but whenever                  it comes time for actual development of it, that&rsquo;s when                  people step in. </p>                <p class="style7">And that discovery which I made on my own, and Wade has made                  it on his own, and many, many others -- Tom Bearden -- many,                  many other people on the cutting edge of these technologies                  have all come to believe that the world is definitely controlled                  by a cabal of people who don&rsquo;t want this to happen. </p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s the saddest part of it, is the                  lack of awareness among most people in the world that this                  is even a possibility. And if I were to develop policy, my                  own thinking is that: <em>&quot;Well,                  we should leave no stone unturned in our quest for clean energy,                  and creating a world of abundance.&quot;</em></p>                <p class="style7">But somehow that&rsquo;s perceived by The Powers That Be as                  a threat to them, just like significant economic reform -- or <em>economic                  revolution</em> is probably a better word now for the situation                  we&rsquo;re in -- has been vehemently opposed by Wall                  Street and the people in charge. They&rsquo;re digging their                  heels in. </p>                <p class="style7">So we&rsquo;re involved in this incredible storyline that&rsquo;s                  probably more sensational than anything that could be dreamt                  up in Hollywood. And unfortunately most people have been very                  slow to awaken to this possibility.</p>                <p class="style7">Because in a sense the politically palatable                  way of presenting this material is that, simply: <em>&quot;This                  is a possibility. Let&rsquo;s                  look at it. Let&rsquo;s see how we might be able to implement                  it. Let&rsquo;s see what kind of world we can have with this                  implementation.&quot;</em> These are the questions that need                  to be asked now.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Thank you, Brian. Wade, what do you think about                  the potential for free energy now, after you&rsquo;ve been                  through all that you&rsquo;ve been through? Politically, I                  mean... What do you think the chances of actually turning the                  tide, as you say, using white-hats who are obviously, you know,                  not happy with the situation? And there are many people behind -- they&rsquo;re                  very unhappy with the current situation. They&rsquo;re looking                  for news ways of doing things. Do you think that the climate                  is such that perhaps this new energy technology can now come                  through?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; I think you&rsquo;re kind of getting to the nub                  of the matter here. In my work -- and again the things                  I realized, and this was through my radicalizing experiences -- there&rsquo;s                  the black-hats and the white-hats and they&rsquo;re definitely                  doing their thing. </p>                <p class="style7">At the same time, they&rsquo;re really not                  very powerful. I mean, you&rsquo;re talking maybe                  a few thousand people out of six billion people. And                  they have definitely a lot of tricks in their bag. </p>                <p class="style7">But when the dust settled in Ventura I realized                  that if <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/conun.htm#done" target="_blank">I had                  a hundred Dennis's</a>, free energy would have been                    easy. It would have been... We&rsquo;d have been unstoppable.                    But there&rsquo;s                  only a few of him on the planet. </p>                <p class="style7">So, the thing is for me, is that it&rsquo;s not about the                  white- and black-hats. It&rsquo;s about us, the great unwashed                  masses. We can make it happen. But we can&rsquo;t make it happen                  if we can&rsquo;t even imagine that it can be better. </p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s the message that I&rsquo;m trying                  to get across. I&rsquo;m trying to <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/scarcity.htm" target="_blank">make                  free energy thinkable</a>. I&rsquo;m trying                  to make it to where... to bring it out of, either as Bill said,                  some guy tinkering in his garage, or some <em>Star Trek</em> fantasy                  or something, to say: <em>&quot;Now these things,                  I know they&rsquo;re real. I know they&rsquo;re possible.&quot;</em> And                  the outcome of that... </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;ve been living with this for many years. I <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/visions.htm#can1" target="_blank">can                    barely imagine</a> what it could do. The whole course of the human journey                  could change very dramatically. And so, I think if enough people                  kind of understood that, it wouldn&rsquo;t take very many people                  to just even think about this stuff to maybe create enough                  momentum to go in the direction of helping it happen. </p>                <p class="style7">Because what happens is, the people pursuing                  these things, they&rsquo;re out there alone in the desert.                  I mean, that&rsquo;s                  the problem. They&rsquo;re out there alone in the desert and                  they&rsquo;re so vulnerable. Again, most people <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#make" target="_blank">just                  take the money</a>. So the hundred billion dollars in quiet                  money... I bet that worked ninety-five percent of the time.                  They just took the money and it was over.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And when you don&rsquo;t take the money, what do                  you think happens to the people when they don&rsquo;t take                  the money?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Then <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#bearden" target="_blank">they                start playing rough</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. </p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; And again, most people take the                  money. In fact, again, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#bearden" target="_blank">Bearden</a>,                  I heard him talk eleven years ago or so about this. And so                  what they do is... it&rsquo;s a                  carrot and stick. </p>                <p class="style7">They&rsquo;re very subtle. I mean, it&rsquo;s a very... how                  to say it? If they came right out in the open and it was very                  obvious what they were doing, too many people would catch on.                  So it&rsquo;s a very sophisticated, very subtle kind of way                  they operate. You know, it took me over ten years <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/other.htm#darker" target="_blank">after                  the sting operation almost nabbed us</a> for me to kind of figure out                  what was going on. And so it&rsquo;s very subtle. </p>                <p class="style7">And Bearden talks about how they operate. Again,                  what I&rsquo;ve                  seen, I think he&rsquo;s right. And also what I&rsquo;ve seen,                  though, is that one provocateur set loose in the midst of a                  hundred average people? <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/hitman.htm" target="_blank">Provocateur                  prevails</a>. Particularly                  when you start having the pressure of like we were experiencing                  in <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#mr" target="_blank">Ventura</a> and <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy1.htm#run" target="_blank">Seattle</a>.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So what is it... do you think that they&rsquo;re                  still after you, so to speak, in that they&rsquo;re still messing                  with you and the people that you know that are working in this                  area?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Oh God! Oh sure!</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Do you think they&rsquo;re still messing with you?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know of an issue of                  a greater magnitude than the energy issue that humanity&rsquo;s                  facing right now. Oh my God, we&rsquo;re having wars in Asia,                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/america.htm#invading" target="_blank">killing millions of people</a> over the hydrocarbons.                  The issue is so multi-faceted, it&rsquo;s so immense, that...                  Oh yes, this is being very carefully managed. </p>                <p class="style7">And again, these &ldquo;disruptive technologies&rdquo; are                  very carefully monitored. What my friend saw was somehow                  somebody snuck something out the back door and demonstrated                  some of the stuff, you know? It&rsquo;s very tightly controlled                  to make sure that &ldquo;disruptive technologies&rdquo;, particularly                  like free energy, do not appear on the scene. </p>                <p class="style7">You know, it&rsquo;s possible that it&rsquo;s                  going to come down to the white-hats and black-hats. It&rsquo;s                  possible that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to be determined.                  Part of me hopes that&rsquo;s not how it happens. Part of me                  hopes that enough of <em>US</em> make                  enough noise in a positive way. </p>                <p class="style7">But if enough people understood the potential, understood                  what was possible, and understood how important they could                  be to help making that happen by just <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/conun.htm#done" target="_blank">simply                  lending their awareness to the issue</a>... That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying                  to find out. I think that that&rsquo;s a way that it can happen.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Thank you, Wade. That&rsquo;s great. Brian, I would                  like to ask you, because it sounds like you and Wade are actually                  on the same page with this, as far as what&rsquo;s necessary                  next is to get the word out in such a way                  that people become educated so that the mass of people can                  actually maybe turn the tide. Is that your feeling?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Absolutely, Kerry. And indeed Wade and I                  are on the same page. And it&rsquo;s not very many of us on                  this planet that are on the same page right now, so it&rsquo;s                  kind of a lonely process. But to the degree that we can at                  least instill in enough people the fact that these things are                  very real, that the concepts have been shown to exist, that                  their development requires an R &amp; D effort like anything                  else that involves new technologies. This certainly has happened                  in information technology quite abundantly.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So, Wade, what are you doing now? I mean, I know                  you&rsquo;ve kind of run a very hard race, it sounds like,                  trying to get this stuff out there. Are you in touch with some                  people now that are actually working on free energy that are                  being interfered with?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Yes. Yes, there&rsquo;s some. I lived                  through it. On my journey I saw enough people like me going                  through similar things. Brian is in contact with many more                  of those kind of people than I am. I&rsquo;m aware of quite                  a few. I&rsquo;m                  in touch with some. And I love them, these                  people who are trying to do these things, but they                  don&rsquo;t have any support.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Your effort is to drum up the support? </p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Yes!</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; In other words, you&rsquo;ve kind of changed your                  tactic from encouraging or working on free energy directly                  yourself, to trying to drum up a grassroots effort?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; In the end, if I can have a part                  in helping people just imagine that it&rsquo;s possible, for                  me... I&rsquo;m                  done. If I achieve that, I will have achieved something                  that I would be happy to achieve. That would be enough for                  me to just help enough people understand that these things                  are feasible, and what can come out of that. </p>                <p class="style7">Yes, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve been since                  1989 when I sprung Dennis from jail. I was pretty much done.                  And again he got me to rejoin with him back in &rsquo;96, &rsquo;97.                  I was only there a few months but it was a thing where I haven&rsquo;t                  really been actively involved in doing the <em>Indiana Jones</em> thing                  for, again, twenty years. </p>                <p class="style7">And again, three years was... That was enough. It was enough                  for one life for me of doing that. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know                  how Dennis does it. Some of these people, I don&rsquo;t know                  how they do it. I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; When you say you <em>don&rsquo;t know how they do                    it,</em> you&rsquo;re saying you don&rsquo;t know how they                    deal with the opposition that they get? Is that what you                    mean?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; No-no. I mean, so here&rsquo;s Dennis,                  survived a number of murder attempts, been behind bars twice                  for two years, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#violate" target="_blank">almost                  got killed inside there</a>, turned down <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#offer" target="_blank">a                  billion-dollar offer to go away</a>. There&rsquo;s now, again,                  there&rsquo;s going                  to be some TV show&rsquo;s going to smear him on Sunday. The                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paths.htm#ftc" target="_blank">FTC&rsquo;s trying                  to shut him down</a>, and he&rsquo;s still at                  it! That&rsquo;s the part where I&rsquo;m going:<em> How do                  you still keep doing it? </em>So that&rsquo;s the thing that,                  for me, boggles my mind.</p>                <p class="style7">Or again, there&rsquo;s other people. I mean, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/journey.htm#greer" target="_blank">Greer&rsquo;s                  one of them</a>. They go through immense hardships, and they come                  back for more. And for me, that&rsquo;s... </p>                <p class="style7">Like Brian. <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paths.htm#oleary" target="_blank">Brian&rsquo;s                    been doing this for a long time</a>.                  And I&rsquo;ve been doing it, but I don&rsquo;t play at their                  level. I tried to do something                  different and again, the ride was too rough for me. The ride                  was too rough. And I said<em>: &quot;I can&rsquo;t afford to                  do that anymore&quot;.</em> Anyway, that&rsquo;s kind of what                  I was saying, is that I don&rsquo;t know how some of these                  people are able to do what they do.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Are you familiar with <a href="ralph_ring.html" target="_blank">Ralph                    Ring</a>? Ralph Ring is                  a free energy person from way back. Back in the &rsquo;60s,                  the FBI came in and closed him down when he was working with                  Otis Carr. So I wondered if perhaps you knew about him. He&rsquo;s                  quite elderly.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; No.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; He&rsquo;s actually now back at it. He&rsquo;s back                  at work trying to get funding, and...</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; I have nothing but admiration...</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So do you give advice to these people?                  John Hutchison, for example. Do you know him?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Yes. I&rsquo;ve interacted with Mr.                  Hutchison. Oh man... it&rsquo;s hard,&nbsp; because I can...                  That they&rsquo;re                  trying to do it is so honorable and wonderful, and the odds                  against them are<em> SO </em>immense. I mean, they&rsquo;re<em> SO </em>immense.                  in                  today&rsquo;s world. And so it&rsquo;s like a mouse                  trying to take on an elephant. And you&rsquo;re seeing                  this and my heart goes out to these people for this. </p>                <p class="style7">And again, I&rsquo;m trying to say: &quot; <em>I&rsquo;m                    trying to get you some help by helping more people to become                    aware of what&rsquo;s going on.&quot;</em> Because most of                    these people, they just end up... as Brian said this is a                    lonely, lonely journey. They can&rsquo;t do it by themselves. </p>                <p class="style7">My opinion is that they don&rsquo;t have a                  prayer by themselves. They&rsquo;re too vulnerable. It&rsquo;s                  easy to take them out. We had hundreds and hundreds of                  people involved when they took us out. It takes more. It takes                  more people                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy1.htm#burn" target="_blank">with the right                  stuff</a>.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Do you think times have changed sufficiently to                  where there might be a chance for these people, because of                  the downturn in the economy and the discontent that&rsquo;s                  out there?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Yes, I believe that the big shifts will happen quite                  often when the current structure kind of crumbles. Right? So                  it does bring opportunities. </p>                <p class="style7">Yes, these are very pregnant times. I believe that we are                  in the middle of quite a transition. Whether we make it or                  not is probably still an open question, but I think we are                  in this transitory time when the old ways are starting to crumble.                  So yes, there&rsquo;s lots of opportunity. </p>                <p class="style7">And again, what Brian is trying to do, what                  I&rsquo;m trying                  to do is to give extremely positive solutions that are right                  there. It wouldn&rsquo;t take much to <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/abund.htm#abundance" target="_blank">turn                  this into heaven on Earth</a>. It really wouldn&rsquo;t take                  that much to do that. Definitely there&rsquo;s more people                  who are pulling up from the dream, let&rsquo;s say, that we&rsquo;re                  all kind of fed, and trying to see differently. So yes, I think                  there&rsquo;s                  opportunity.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well it&rsquo;s wonderful to hear you say that.                  And obviously, after all that you&rsquo;ve been through, it&rsquo;s                  really extraordinary that you can still hold that perspective.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Well, thank you, and it hasn&rsquo;t been easy.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; [laughs] OK. Well I did want to ask you, what was                  your paranormal event, or series of events, that pushed you                  on this road?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; OK. I was this science                  prodigy as a young child. And again, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paths.htm#oleary" target="_blank">my                  dad used to work in Mission Control</a>,                  and so... I mean, my dad left Houston just before Brian moved                  there, and so we&rsquo;ve had these kind of parallel... </p>                <p class="style7">Anyhow, I was this kind of space brat, scientist                  kid. And as a teenager I started getting introduced to some                  of the pretty mundane inventions that were, compared to what&rsquo;s                  on the market, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#glimpse" target="_blank">truly revolutionary</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">And again that&rsquo;s when I started kind                  of &ldquo;getting                  it.&rdquo; Like when I was twelve years old, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/medicine.htm#lessons" target="_blank">my                  father reversed the hardening of his arteries</a> by adopting                  a live-food diet, something that medicine at that time said                  was impossible. So I was introduced to the impossible happening                  at age twelve. And again, I had my mystical awakening at age                  sixteen...</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. But what&rsquo;s your mystical awakening? What                  do you mean when you say your <em>mystical awakening</em>?&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; OK. That&rsquo;s a good question.                  Brian and I had the same exercise that both initiated our mystical                  awakening, which was... back then it was called the <em>Edgar                  Cayce Method</em>.                  Today they call it remote viewing. But <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/spirit.htm#silva" target="_blank">I                  was in a <em>Silva                  Mind Control</em> class in 1974</a>. <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paths.htm#awakening" target="_blank">Brian                  took <em>Lifespring</em> in                  1979</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">And at the end of this training, you&rsquo;re                  given the name, age, sex, and city and then I was able to describe...                  Well, actually more dramatically, I had somebody in mind, and                  I gave this information to somebody else, and they were able                  to describe to me -- <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/spirit.htm#brown" target="_blank">in                  startling detail</a> -- this person. </p>                <p class="style7">That was the beginning of my mystical awakening,                  was seeing people perform psychically, very dramatically. And                  then it was my turn and I was able to do the same thing. And                  Brian, when he took <em>Lifespring</em>, he had the same experience.                  In fact, those classes were very popular in the &rsquo;70s.                  Millions of people took them with similar results. </p>                <p class="style7">Anyway, for me, that turned something on in                  me and I think it opened up my intuitive side. But again, to                  me it was the beginning of my mystical awakening. And most                  of my fellow travelers in this field, they usually had some                  kind of experience like that when they were in their late teens                  or early twenties. <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/journey.htm#mystical" target="_blank">Greer had a                  near-death experience at seventeen</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">One of my fellow travelers had a Kundalini                  experience as a college physics student and then <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#traveler" target="_blank">developed                  a free energy prototype that was immediately seized</a>.                  And again, he was in his early twenties. This is a very common                  age when this kind of thing happened. </p>                <p class="style7">And my professional mentor that <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#glimpse" target="_blank">invented                    the engine</a> and stuff,                  you know, &ldquo;world&rsquo;s best engine&rdquo; <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#flash" target="_blank">comes                  to him at a stoplight</a>! Where does that come from? </p>                <p class="style7">So anyway, I just had enough of those kinds of experiences                  and then had some of my own experiences that really opened                  my eyes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; What about UFOs? Did you have any kind of encounter                  experiences?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Yes. I&rsquo;ve encountered lots                  of people who&rsquo;ve                  seen craft. Some people have had &ldquo;close encounters                  of the third kind&rdquo;. But I just heard a lot of this stuff.                  It was on my list of things to do, was to go out and see one,                  and then... </p>                <p class="style7">Anyway, one of my fellow free energy travelers                  said he would go down near Mount Adams and watch UFOs fly over.                  A couple of my aerospace buddies from Boeing organized a trip                  there, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/ufo.htm#visit2005" target="_blank">in 2005</a>,                  for us to go watch UFOs, and we got our show. And I went                  back the next two years in a row, and <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/ufo.htm#visit2006" target="_blank">I                  got a show every year</a>.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Oh, you went to Trout Lake? <em>[Ed.                    note: James Gilliland's ranch in Washington state]</em></p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely. We went as well, and we&rsquo;ve seen                  James Gilliland&rsquo;s, you know, we&rsquo;ve been up to his                  ranch and saw the craft.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Our first night there, James said: <em>&quot;Let                    me see if I can get one to do something&quot;</em>, and <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/ufo.htm#call" target="_blank">a                    minute later one did</a>, very dramatically. In fact, there                    was an Air Force captain standing next to me, and again,                    a couple of Boeing guys, and it blew their doors off, that&rsquo;s                    for sure. So anyway, yes. I&rsquo;ve experienced that.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Bill is telling me that when your friend had his                  machine seized, that they knew it was there even though it                  was a secret. Do you think they remote-viewed? They had their                  remote viewers tap into the situation?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; You know, I don&rsquo;t know on that                  one. I just know that, actually <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#traveler" target="_blank">it                  got seized twice</a>. I&rsquo;m going: <em>&quot;Wow,                  they must have pretty good surveillance to do that kind of                  stuff.&quot;</em> And then again in my circles, somebody who                  should know said: <em>&quot;Oh yes. They can tell when anybody in                  the planet taps into that field.&quot;</em> And I&rsquo;m like:                  <em>&quot;Oh...                  OK.&quot;</em></p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t know exactly how they&rsquo;re able to surveil                  and to do this but they did. He was a physics student and he                  actually goes into this physics lab and he bread-boards a prototype                  that works. I think he was using the radiant effect, which                  is one of the free energy ways out there. </p>                <p class="style7">He had a <em>Men-in-Black </em>experience                  a few hours later... seized the prototype. He was kind of booted                  out onto the sidewalk, kind of going: <em>&quot;What the hell was                  that all about?&quot;</em> He was probably, you know, twenty-one                  or something. And anyway, so he&rsquo;s like: <em>&quot;They can&rsquo;t                  do that!&quot;</em></p>                <p class="style7">So he goes and rents out some warehouse space                  somewhere very secretly under an assumed name. So he&rsquo;s                  doing this secretly -- they&rsquo;ll never find out. And he                  ends up making it happen again and a few hours later, Men-in-Black                  experience again.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s fascinating. I&rsquo;m sure they surveil                  the entire planet for free energy devices and I imagine they                  are able to pick them up in the matrix.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; When I asked somebody: <em>&quot;How&rsquo;d                    they do that?&quot;</em> they said: <em>&quot;Well, they                    have satellite technology that can surveil the whole planet.                    Anybody taps into this ZPE field, they know it.&quot;</em> So                    I&rsquo;m                    like: <em>&quot;Oh. OK.&quot;</em></p>                <p class="style7">And, my understanding is that if you ever tap                  into that kind of stuff, it depends on who you are and where                  you are as far as what their response will be. So if you&rsquo;re                  a group of a hundred people, they&rsquo;re going                  to have to be very careful about how they do it. But if you&rsquo;re                  just a kid in a lab, they just send in the team. It&rsquo;s                  easy to take care of it with just one person.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Do you think that their tactics have changed over                  the years?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; I would imagine. In your                  journey you just hear these various things happening, and you&rsquo;re                  kinda going: <em>&quot;Whoa! Look at that.&quot; </em>Yes. </p>                <p class="style7">So what they used to, let&rsquo;s say thirty                  years ago or so, they were extremely violent. I mean I&rsquo;ve                  heard of stuff like a guy&rsquo;s whole family being murdered,                  and then they burn the house down and then bulldoze it.                  And this kind of stuff has happened. </p>                <p class="style7">Dennis has been high profile a number of times. In Ventura                  we were pretty high profile, and we were approached once. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m going to say probably thirty years                  ago, there was this guy who was... <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/advent.htm#windmill" target="_blank">he                  had built a windmill farm out in the Southwest</a>. He was                  rich. He was like apparently worth four hundred million dollars,                  and he invested thirty-five million dollars of his own money                  into this windmill farm. He was making electricity. He was                  trying to sell it to electric companies. And then he was working                  late at the office one night and he gets a call and pretty                  much the caller made it very clear that: <em>&quot;You                  have a choice. You can either leave your facility there, never                  return, or your family will be dead by dawn. What&rsquo;s it                  going to be?&quot;</em></p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; [laughs] Wow.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; And again, when you&rsquo;re worth                  four hundred million dollars they can&rsquo;t... what kind                  of carrot can you give to somebody worth four hundred million                  dollars? So they just come right out with the stick. Anyway,                  this guy, he goes: <em>Well,                  I took out my calculator and I banged in the numbers and that                  was nine percent of my net worth. And I just decided it ain&rsquo;t                  worth it.</em> He                  just packed his briefcase and leaves and never returned. </p>                <p class="style7">And again, he showed up at our office in a                  limo just before they dropped the sledgehammer on us, and he                  said: <em>&quot;I wish you guys the best, but you have no                  idea what you&rsquo;re                  up against.&quot; </em>So I kind of found out what he was talking                  about. But I&rsquo;m saying back then they used to                  do stuff like that. My understanding is that it&rsquo;s a more                  subtle game that takes place now.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; What do you think Brian? Do you think it&rsquo;s                  more subtle nowadays?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Oh, very good question, Kerry. Yes, I think                  it&rsquo;s a bit more subtle now. I know I&rsquo;ve had my                  own experiences and have matched it with others that go back                  to the early &rsquo;90s -- and very unpleasant experiences                  where I refused to be recruited into something and there was                  some recrimination and some threats that I won&rsquo;t go into                  in detail. </p>                <p class="style7">But I think if I compare my story with that of others and                  look at the history of all of this... Although I can&rsquo;t                  say for sure because like my dear friend and late colleague,                  <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/journey.htm#mallove" target="_blank">Gene Mallove</a>, was brutally murdered in &rsquo;04.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; What do you think tipped it over the edge with Mallove?                  Do you think that he was too close to something or that he                  simply couldn&rsquo;t be brought under their wing in a certain                  way? Why do you think they attacked him so brutally?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; He was a true hero. He&rsquo;s one of my                  heroes of my lifetime. I just tremendously respected his work                  because... He was the chief science writer for MIT and in 1989                  Fleischmann and Pons, two chemists from the University of Utah,                  claimed to have discovered cold fusion, which is a process                  that has now been replicated many, many times over by many                  competent scientists. But at that time, 1989, their claim was                  viciously refuted by some of the nuclear physicists at MIT. </p>                <p class="style7">Well, Mallove was going to support them in debunking the cold                  fusion discovery and found instead that the MIT scientists                  were not only falsely debunking the evidence but actually committing                  fraud. And so he had the courage to stand up to these scientists,                  and to MIT, whereupon he was summarily dismissed,                  [laughs] went on his own, and founded <em>Infinite Energy Magazine</em>,                  which I think is a wonderful magazine, particularly in those                  days when he was editor. </p>                <p class="style7">He was a real advocate of new energy, probably the most articulate                  one because he was very rigorous scientifically. He would not                  make any claims that couldn&rsquo;t be substantiated. And so,                  obviously from the point of view of the world controllers,                  he was a threat. And he was also in the process of getting                  funding for creating a research and development laboratory. </p>                <p class="style7">He had been shuttling back and forth to Washington just before                  his murder, which, although the cover story of the murder was                  that it was a robbery, the real story... I would say almost                  anybody that knew him, including his family, are just, you                  know, beside themselves in trying to find out how this happened,                  who did it, and so forth. And so there&rsquo;s an example of                  a real hero who was sacrificed.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Do you think that he was sacrificed                  because he was &ldquo;one                  of them&rdquo; originally and because he was so articulate                  and getting so close? I mean, in the sense that he worked for                  MIT. He wasn&rsquo;t just some guy with an invention                  in his garage. He actually came out of a very sophisticated                  background.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. I would imagine, yes, because he was                  one of the shakers and movers of the field and he pulled no                  punches. He also had a very, very well-grounded scientific                  and philosophical perspective on the issues raised by the possibility                  of free energy. And so he just... this obviously disturbed                  The Powers That Be.</p>                <p class="style7">Another example was Stefan Marinov, who was a professor of                  physics at the University of Graz in Austria. And also just                  a few years ago - I forgot the exact year, but it was early                  this century - he &ldquo;jumped&rdquo; from the tenth story                  of his library building at the University                  of Graz. </p>                <p class="style7">Well, he was Europe&rsquo;s premier free energy advocate.                  I&rsquo;d met him many times, talked with him. He seemed to                  be a very jolly, and very, very well-adjusted person who was                  doing really good breakthrough work, even had a motor that                  he had invented which he demonstrated and quite widely showed.                  So it&rsquo;s just another example. There are just so many                  examples of suppression.</p>                <p class="style7">John Hutchison, a dear friend of mine. We&rsquo;ve toured                  Japan together and he&rsquo;s had... Thank God he&rsquo;s still                  alive. He&rsquo;s just a brilliant man who has managed to develop                  dramatic demonstrations of antigravity technology, with a fantastic                  intuition, and just a very fine person. Well, the US military                  has given him no end of problems. </p>                <p class="style7">So, you look at these stories, one                  after another, and you have to come to the conclusion that                  pretty consistently right up until this moment, these developments                  have been suppressed. And is it getting any better? I don&rsquo;t                  know. I know we&rsquo;ve                  had these discussions, Kerry, and you have found some signs                  that it is and I would love to think that it is. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that the people that really need to awaken here, as                  Wade often suggests, that the only people that seem to awaken                  and are able to <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paradigm.htm#peeling" target="_blank">peel the free                  energy onion</a> are people that                  are already somewhat <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paths.htm#sentience" target="_blank">sentient</a> and have had experiences in a                  number of different avenues -- not only science, or not                  only being a political progressive -- but that people                  somehow need to go through many, many different experiences                  in a variety of ways before they can even embrace the possibility                  that this could happen. </p>                <p class="style7">I know for me, I had to go out and visit the                  inventors, the researchers, myself and make it a                  personal project to see these proofs-of-concept, and most people                  don&rsquo;t                  have that luxury. And so I feel for them when somebody like                  me... even though I have all these good credentials. Even so,                  most people that call themselves &ldquo;pragmatists&rdquo; will                  kind of roll their eyes or glaze, and they won&rsquo;t even                  look at the possibility that this could be. </p>                <p class="style7">But then if we understand the history of science.                  If we understand the famous Bertrand Russell quote: <em>&quot;The                  resistance to a new idea increases as the square of its importance</em>&quot;... </p>                <p class="style7">And if we&rsquo;re talking about totally revamping the economy,                  totally revamping our energy system, totally revamping our                  whole industrial and financial culture, which is digging its                  heels in alongside the military / industrial complex, you&rsquo;re                  talking about a revolution here, an energy-solution revolution,                  which... to the degree that people can become educated to this                  possibility and to acknowledge it -- or at least lean                  into it -- to even ask the simple question: <em>OK, I                  don&rsquo;t believe this is real or possible, but let&rsquo;s                  do a mind exercise and let&rsquo;s say: &ldquo;Well, OK, let&rsquo;s                  say if somebody comes along with a technology that could truly                  do this, do we want to have it?&rdquo;</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And I should think that the clear answer would                  be <em>&quot;Yes!&quot; </em>As                  long as we can develop social and political systems to birth                  this whole new paradigm shift, and then we have a fighting                  chance, I think. And Wade, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d totally                  agree that we have a fighting chance to save the planet, to                  respect the Earth and nature.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s wonderful, Brian. I think that,                  you know, that&rsquo;s a very good point and very well said                  by you. And Bill wants me to say, that most                  great scientists are mystics.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Well that&rsquo;s what... I mean, if you look at                  the guys who... physics rides on their shoulders today, Einstein,                  and Heisenberg, and Schr&ouml;dinger, and these guys, they                  all to one degree or another <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#mystical" target="_blank">had                  a mystical orientation</a>. </p>                <p class="style7">And again in my own experience with my Tesla-like                  mentor and again the other people, my fellow travelers, again                  on the cutting edge of this free energy stuff, they pretty                  much all have a mystical orientation, to one degree or another.                  I mean, some are way out there. Some visit other dimensions.                  And some are kind of like: <em>&quot;Oh, I think I have                  past lives.&quot;</em> So there&rsquo;s                  a spectrum there, but essentially they&rsquo;re not materialists.                  I mean, none of them are materialists.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Wade, were you familiar with Mallove and his work?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Somewhat. I was in contact with Mallove.                  And again, the <a href="https://www.newenergymovement.org/recapsa1.php?p=recapsa.php" target="_blank">New                  Energy Movement</a> was organizing its conference that                  it had in 2004 and Mallove was the first speaker lined up.                  And anyway, we lined him up and a week after that, which was                  a very strange week, very emotional... It was a bizarre week.                  Anyway, he gets murdered as I&rsquo;m being emailed from one                  of the participants saying: <em>&quot;I think we&rsquo;re under                  attack.&quot;</em> Anyway,                  I had that encounter with Mallove.</p>                <p class="style7">Again, the thing with Mallove, with me and                  his work was that I read something he wrote less than a year                  before he died where he was saying <a href="https://www.pureenergysystems.com/obituaries/2004/EugeneMallove/LastMessage040513/" target="_blank">there&rsquo;s                  three main ways to go after free energy</a>. And one of them                  was <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#marry" target="_blank">the                  <em>exact</em> thing we were trying in Ventura</a> [laughs], which was                  taking atmospheric heat and being able to get useful work out                  of it. And again, I was interested in what he had to say about                  that, so I contacted him and we were going to have some more                  exchanges, and then he died.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. OK. I&rsquo;m sorry. You                  had spoken about that earlier on and I had forgotten about                  that association. </p>                <p class="style7">Well, this is really very, very impressive. Both you guys                  have got such a great background in all of this and the fact                  that you&rsquo;ve taken even your technical skills and turned                  them into public speaking, to where you would actually bring                  the knowledge to the people and make what is in essence a grassroots                  movement is really brilliant, you know. It&rsquo;s really the                  best approach, I would think. So I just want to say thank you                  from all of us for doing that, both you, Wade Frazier, and                  Brian O&rsquo;Leary. </p>                <p class="style7">Have you guys known each other for a long time?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Well, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/paths.htm#intersecting" target="_blank">I                    met Brian in &rsquo;91</a> when I had                  to pick him up at the airport for a New Science conference.                  We drove right past Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and made                  jokes about Hangar 18, the Blue Room, and stuff, and so that&rsquo;s                  when I met Brian. And then when he published <em>Miracle in                  the Void</em> in &rsquo;96, I bought about thirty-five copies                  of it. </p>                <p class="style7">Anyway, Brian, it quickly became evident to me... I&rsquo;d                  already been through my salad days on the free energy front                  when I met Brian, and it became very clear that Brian was hip.                  We&rsquo;ve had <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/cover-up.htm#governor" target="_blank">interactions                  over the years</a> and he invited                  me to be on the <a href="https://www.newenergymovement.org/" target="_blank">New                  Energy Movement</a> board back in 2003. We&rsquo;re                  living on different continents right now, but as much as I                  can help Brian do what he does, I&rsquo;m honored to do it.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; I feel the same way about                  you, Wade, that some of your insight, and our journeys in parallel                  and together, that our interactions have been very important                  and that there&rsquo;s                  been a lot of learning on my part from you, in giving this                  a broader context than just vetting this or that new energy                  concept, which people still ask me for. They still come to                  me and say: <em>&quot;Hey what do you think of this? What do you                  think of the air car? What do you think of this sonoluminescence                  device?&quot;</em> I&rsquo;ve now gone away from that. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m more interested in combining politics with these                  concepts and also observing. Because I think, Wade, you helped                  radicalize me in some of the writings of <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/lies.htm#manufacturing" target="_blank">Noam                  Chomsky and Ed Herman</a> and so forth, that these are the kinds of guys that                  you would think could awaken to this, but no, they haven&rsquo;t.                  And the same thing goes for Richard Heinberg. </p>                <p class="style7">So we keep trying to tell them: <em>&quot;Well,                    what about the possibility of this?</em>&quot; And now and then                    you&rsquo;ll get this scathing                    response from the likes of <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/hooked.htm#heinberg" target="_blank">Heinberg</a> or <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/hooked.htm#ruppert" target="_blank">Mike                    Ruppert</a> or                    some other people that you&rsquo;d think would embrace these                    things, but somehow are still very much in denial. </p>                <p class="style7">So it is a lonely road. And the people                  that I think will be taking the lead here will be brand new                  people, people that will come forward. And maybe this economic                  crisis is now providing a greater opportunity - it&rsquo;s                  my hope anyway - for us to develop a new kind of leadership,                  systemically, and really start from scratch, and to make a                  change we can believe in [laughs] not let it just be empty                  slogans that respond to Wall Street and the military-industrial                  complex, which in turn responds to higher forces that are somehow                  suppressing these possibilities.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Thank you, Brian. That&rsquo;s wonderful. What I&rsquo;d                  like to do is bring back Bill here. But I also wanted to ask                  both of you if you could respond to what is it you think when                  you see things like, you know, the Space Shuttle and the Space                  Station and the way they&rsquo;re dealing with this? What in                  essence is sending a tin can up into the air, you know? [laughs]                  I mean, what do you think when you see that they&rsquo;re creating                  a new technology, supposedly planning to go to Mars and Moon?                  There&rsquo;s a new mission underway. But what do you think                  about the technology they&rsquo;re going to use to do these                  things, the fact that they&rsquo;re still relying on this old                  technology?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; You know, for one, I think that we&rsquo;re                  living in the past. We&rsquo;re living with past models that                  are falling apart. Ever since the Space Shuttle was first proposed                  I realized that NASA was falling apart because it was a bureaucratic                  invention, kind of a miasma. And the same with the Space Station,                  sort of a &ldquo;Tinker-Toys&rdquo; designed                  by aerospace companies to line their pockets. </p>                <p class="style7">Right now the technologies we&rsquo;re using                  are drastically old. They&rsquo;re simply not worthwhile. They&rsquo;re                  in the past. It&rsquo;s expensive. It pollutes the atmosphere.                  The Shuttle itself contributes to the hole in the ozone layer.                  Every launch is something like ten-to-fifteen billion dollars.                  We can&rsquo;t afford that kind of stuff.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; What do you think about the fact that they&rsquo;re                  planning to power the new missions using nuclear?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Ah! That&rsquo;s disaster! You know, if                  you get me going on nuclear... I was the nuclear energy advisor                  to Morris Udall&rsquo;s Energy and Environment subcommittee                  of the US congress, and our committee pretty single-handedly                  stopped nuclear power in its tracks. </p>                <p class="style7">Any kind of nuclear technology, for anybody that looks at                  it, is highly dangerous. The long-lived radioactive waste products...                  we haven&rsquo;t found a way to bury them. They have half-lives                  of tens of thousands of years. We&rsquo;re polluting the Earth                  for our children and their children and for all of nature. </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;ve got tolet go of that technology                  one hundred percent. For nuclear technology to be used in any                  space application or any application on the Earth is yet another                  big danger-point. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s sort of like right now humans are <em>terror-forming</em> the                  Earth with various geo-engineering projects, whether it&rsquo;s                  the development of nuclear technology, or chemtrails, or depleted                  uranium. These are all horrible, horrible projects. </p>                <p class="style7">And you see, we need to develop a new kind of advocacy, a                  new combination of truth movements that look at all of these                  things -- 9/11, the official story -- to kind of &ldquo;pop                  a bubble&rdquo; of the sacred myths of our time and to proceed                  onward with the kinds of new technologies that are clean and                  cheap, like free energy. We just have to do this! And people                  have to awaken. And right now, there aren&rsquo;t very many                  of us that advocate that. </p>                <p class="style7">So to the degree your listeners can begin to embrace these                  things and to make the leap of faith, if you will, before really                  finding out in great detail that a number of myths need to                  be destroyed, we need some sort of process of truth and reconciliation.                  We need to radically change our systems, and Obama is now about                  .00001 percent of the way in doing any of that. </p>                <p class="style7">So it is disappointing, but we just keep having to prevail                  and get to the truth, which is always the first step toward                  realizing what we need to do.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp;&nbsp; Wade, what would you say about the fact that,                  you know, free energy exists? It&rsquo;s been out there for,                  I don&rsquo;t know, since at least the 1950s, wouldn&rsquo;t                  you say? And yet they&rsquo;re planning on powering the next                  mission to Mars and the Moon using nuclear fuel.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; [laughs] Well you know, Brian is the astronaut [Kerry                  laughs] so I definitely defer to Brian&rsquo;s opinion on those                  things. But it&rsquo;s a thing where... </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp;&nbsp; Right...</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Actually, what Brian was just discussing,                  I have a short anecdote, which was: Dennis and I spoke at Department                  of Energy hearings back in 1997 when they were trying to do                  the, what&rsquo;s called <a href="https://www.wipp.energy.gov/" target="_blank">the                  WIPP</a>, which was                  the low-intensity nuclear waste, not the place in Nevada where                  they still... it&rsquo;s not even big enough to hold what they                  got today. </p>                <p class="style7">It was the thing where we approached them with neutralization                  technology to make nuclear waste, I mean, to neutralize it.                  And we were using Brown&rsquo;s Gas. Long story there. But                  anyway, interestingly, we spoke there and we were located right                  next to this Savannah facility, like on Atomic Boulevard. </p>                <p class="style7">Anyway, <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/energy.htm#yull" target="_blank">Dennis                    and I spoke at a couple of hearings that day</a>.                  And the interesting thing was that the most excited person                  at the hearing was the person who organized it. And at the                  lunch break, he actually follows us out to the car and gives                  us his card and stuff. And he said that we were the third group                  that attended these hearings to present a neutralization technology. </p>                <p class="style7">And he said, and I&rsquo;ll never forget this,                  he said: <em>&quot;The people managing nuclear waste stand                  to make a ton of money doing this. If your answer doesn&rsquo;t                  make them a ton of money, it won&rsquo;t go anywhere.&quot;</em> And                  then he said: <em>&quot;I&rsquo;m an underling                  with no power, but I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&quot;</em>                  [laughs] And of course nothing happened. </p>                <p class="style7">Anyway, so to me, yes, as Brian said, actually                  using nuclear fission to actually power these missions and                  stuff -- it&rsquo;s                  nightmarish. It&rsquo;s totally nightmarish. In fact, when                  I know that other, [laughs] totally clean, benign technologies                  exist and we&rsquo;re using this, you know -- extremely                  primitive. As Einstein said: <em>&quot;Nuclear fission&rsquo;s                  one hell of a way to boil water.&quot;</em> So, it&rsquo;s                  just really horrifying. It&rsquo;s actually horrifying that                  we&rsquo;re doing these things.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Thank you so much, both of you                  guys, because that&rsquo;s great to hear you say that and of                  course to hear an astronaut talk about the absurdity                  of using nuclear fuel to send missions out... and here we are                  in 2009. It just kind of boggles the mind. This has to be a                  fake, you know, front game, really, for what is really going                  on behind the scenes, you have to believe, in terms of NASA                  and what&rsquo;s                  really going on there. But what I&rsquo;ll do here is... Bill,                  can you come forward and sort of ask a few questions yourself?                  And I&rsquo;ll translate if necessary.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; [laughs] OK. Thank you. I just want to thank all                  of you, actually, because ever since I realized that my British <em>James                  Bond</em> shaken-but-not-stirred accent wasn&rsquo;t totally                  understandable there, I&rsquo;ve been sitting in the front                  row of this audience, hugely enjoying this conversation. And                  I want to thank you very much for that. And, Kerry, thanks                  a lot for stepping into the MC&rsquo;s shoes here, because                  I know that you hadn&rsquo;t prepared yourself quite as much                  for this interview as I had by reading <a href="https://www.ahealedplanet.net/home.htm" target="_blank">Wade&rsquo;s voluminous                  1200-page website</a> that I invite anyone to take a lucky dip                  into because it is encyclopedic.</p>                <p class="style7">Brian has already answered the final question that I wanted                  to put to you both, which was what changes does he really hope                  to see in his lifetime? </p>                <p class="style7">And what I would like to do is just to ask Wade briefly...                  if you can say something to that, that would inspire any young                  activists, because they are out there. We hear from them regularly,                  people who are on a steep learning curve, and a lot of energy,                  and who haven&rsquo;t yet had that energy blunted. We know                  that they&rsquo;re out there, and those people will find a                  way to listen to this conversation because it&rsquo;s going                  to be very important to them. </p>                <p class="style7">And the opportunity here is to leave those people with something                  that will inspire and encourage them to pick up the torch which                  you two have both been carrying, and of course many others                  have been carrying this torch as well. What can you leave these                  young warriors with, to help them continue with what you&rsquo;ve                  considered your life&rsquo;s work to be?</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Well thank you. What my message would                  be is this: <em>&quot;You                    are not pursuing something ephemeral. You&rsquo;re pursuing                    things that are very real.&quot;</em> OK? These are very                    real. This stuff&rsquo;s real. It&rsquo;s not a fantasy.                    It&rsquo;s                    not some crazy conspiracy theory. This is very real stuff.                    And the potential of this is something that none of us can                    really fathom. We really can&rsquo;t fathom what the potential                    of something like this is. And so, I don&rsquo;t know...                    I mean, I don&rsquo;t know... to me that seems worthwhile!</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; You know, Wade, your life itself and also Brian&rsquo;s                  life, both of you are an inspiration in itself. I mean, your                  actual life experience - and sharing that - is very powerful.                  And I&rsquo;m very happy that Bill was scientifically astute                  enough to be able to target and find you out because you&rsquo;re                  not really in the mainstream at the moment. But you&rsquo;re                  obviously a person that deserves great respect, as does Brian.                  And it&rsquo;s really lovely to hear you speak about your background                  and all, so I just want to thank you very much, both of you.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; I think this has been an excellent conversation.                  I want to thank you both for your time and your commitment.                  It&rsquo;s a long rough road, I think, that you two guys have                  been on, and by speaking out so energetically and positively,                  I think that you will have done a lot to encourage an interest                  and enlighten some of these young activists who we know will                  be watching this -- because this torch must be picked                  up. It&rsquo;s a torch that must grow more                  and more brightly. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m convinced now, Wade, having read a lot of your site,                  that free energy is such a huge issue, and also I should say                  having read several of Brian&rsquo;s books as well. It goes                  everywhere. It goes into the environment. It goes into the                  economy. It goes into politics. It goes into control agendas.                  It goes into every aspect of society that we know about. This                  is why it&rsquo;s really at the heart of everything, and of                  course this is why the activists do get stomped on so hard.                  But you&rsquo;re still standing! And we acknowledge and salute                  you for that and thank you very much indeed for your inspiration                  to everyone who will be listening to this.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Thank you, Bill.</p>                <p class="style7">WF:&nbsp; Thank you, Bill. And thank you for what you and                  Kerry are doing. It&rsquo;s important work. Thanks for being                  there. </p>                <p class="style7"><span class="style7"><br>                  <em><a href="wade_frazier.html" target="_blank">Click                  here</a></em> <font color="#990033"><em><strong>for the audio                  interview </strong></em></font></span><br>                </p>                <p class="style7"> </p>                <div align="left">                  <blockquote>                    <p><font color="#FF9900" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="left"><strong>__________________________</strong></font></p>                  </blockquote>                </div>              </blockquote>            </blockquote>               <br><table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                          <!--DWLayoutTable-->                          <tr>                            <td width="350">                          <div align="center">                                  <table width="425" border="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                                    <tr>                                      <td bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>                                          <font color="#990033">Support Project Camelot - make a donation:</font></strong></em></font></p>                                    <div align="center"><a href="https://projectcamelotportal.com/donate.html"><img src="x-click-but21.gif" width="110" height="23" alt="Donate"></a>
