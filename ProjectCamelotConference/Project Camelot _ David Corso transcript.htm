OK, so what is your connection, right off the bat, with Duncan?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: We go back three years, about three or maybe four years ago. A mutual friend introduced me when he said, &ldquo;<em>I have friends I want you to meet</em>.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;<em>Oh really</em>?&rdquo; So we met up and as soon as I saw John with Duncan, I knew them.<br>      <br>    And it was like an envelope had been opened in my mind, or a doorway if you would. It took a while for those memories to resurface so I could figure out where I had saw them - in June of 1967.<br>    <br>    We were actually in Cambodia... on a little operation to help get some American Special Forces troops out of a bad bind. And we were pinned down by extremely heavy fire when this chopper lands and these twelve kids get out, look around, join hands, and there was this blinding flash. They got back in the chopper. And in the doorway of the chopper was a gentleman in a green uniform, like an Army uniform, fatigues.<br>    <br>    And we talked to the Special Forces team later and we asked, &ldquo;<em>What did you see</em>?&rdquo; And all they saw was a blinding flash. And there had to be at least 2,000 or more [sighs heavily] Vietcong and North Vietnamese regulars and Cambodian communists that were just simply <em>dead</em>. And that's... the only thing I remember of it is the blinding flash. But there was this little kid with a huge... white kid with a huge...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Afro. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Afro, and this little girl, very dark skinned, that was beside him. And they got on the chopper and just flat disappeared. Well, some days later I'm in Saigon and there is this gentleman again from the aircraft. And he didn't introduce himself. He looked at me, I looked at him, and he turned around and walked away. But he had an insignia that I had never seen before on his shoulder.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You were Special Forces?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I was in a group that didn't exist.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What were you called? Green Berets?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Black Operations.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do they have a name for your division, or ...?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Black Operations.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: That's it?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: That's it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Were you ranked in the military before you went into Black Operations?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Uh huh. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: As what? Are you at liberty to say?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Well... officially I was attached to the Navy and my official Navy record isn't at all like what I was involved with.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. What does your official Navy record say you were?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Oh, it says I'm a radar technician and I went to B-School and I was on five ships and I was on a swift boat detachment and I made... was in Vietnam for 14 campaigns.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Now... And what is the reality behind that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I wish I could say for sure, but I have memories that are coming back that I can't explain. But Dunc's already talked to you about Project Talent.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Now, are you feeling that you were part of Project Talent from another angle?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I'll answer that in this manner: When my mother was 87 years old, I said, &ldquo;<em>Mother, I have these reoccurring memories of being with my uncle during the summers</em>.&rdquo; She looked at me and had this mischievous grin on her face. [points to photo on wall] And that's her up on the wall. She said, &ldquo;<em>You were never with your uncle in the summers. You were... away, and you'll figure it out as you get older</em>.&rdquo;</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Is your family patriotic? You know, were they in the service?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: My brothers served in the Marine Corps. Both brothers did. And I was assigned to the Marine Corps, but there's no official record of that.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You flashed back on this memory when you met Duncan? Or after you met Duncan?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: That memory has come back to me several times, but it... When my son was 9 years old, he and I went fishing for a month. And we're in the middle of Strawberry Lake fishing. He's having a tremendously successful day fishing and of course I'm not catching anything. And he looks at me out of the blue and says, &ldquo;<em>Daddy, what did you do in Vietnam? What did you really do?&rdquo;</em> That's the night the nightmares started.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow. And what kind of nightmares are you talking about?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I wish I could tell you but I've talked to my VA counselors many times and they said, &ldquo;<em>Be glad you don't remember them because what you're doing is re-fighting battles</em>.&rdquo;</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But I'm assuming that what part of the nightmare... was seeing the children in the field. Is this right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: That did not happen until... Duncan and I were talking one time about when we remembered seeing each other. And we remembered the same incident, literally word for word.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: But for me, that incident in itself was just like a nightmare. I remember getting off the chopper. I remember the other eleven kids. And I remember the blinding flash and I remember getting back <em>on</em> the chopper. But before the chopper landed, after the chopper took off, I don't remember anything.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In one particular memory that I have that is very vivid... I was in a chopper. I was a little older in this one. And we were shot down. I remember the chopper took off. We didn't get more than 10, 12 feet off the ground. And we took some kind of fire. I call it anti-aircraft fire because, to me, if I'm in an aircraft I don't care if it's a .22 or a 90mm howitzer, if you're shooting at me, it's anti-aircraft fire. And we went down. And I remember this man here [points to David] dragging me out of a burning helicopter.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: [to David] Were you in the helicopter at the time, or were you nearby?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: That, unfortunately, I don't have a recollection of.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: I know he wasn't <em>in</em> the helicopter. I was the only passenger in the helicopter.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. You saw these kids in the field. You saw these people die. Do you know basically how many people you're talking about that were killed?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I would have no idea. There was ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Was it, were there villages? I mean, was it a village like ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No. it was not a village.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: It was in the jungle. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. And were there women ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And there had to be ...and there was ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ...as well as men?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: There could have been. We didn't bother to do a body count.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: No, but I'm just... generally speaking ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: What we <em>saw</em> were men.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh. Soldiers, I imagine?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Yes. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: If you want to call ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: They were armed, in other words.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Oh yes. [laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. All right. Just trying to get to ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: With everybody's favorite weapon, the AK47. Except a few that were carrying M16s and M14s.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: All right. OK. So... and this was what year?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: 1967.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And you were there on a Black Operation.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Uh huh</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. And do you have any other memory of that specific incident?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: [shakes head]. No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: That's it?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: There are memories that are trying to surface that either I am intentionally blanking or they have been blanked extremely well. Because we know that the government can implant false memories and wipe out your memories of your whole, complete life. Now if that happened to me, I don't know. But my son and I have talked. We were talking about something entirely different, and all of a sudden I feel a light come on. But I can't get anything to illuminate with that light.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Have you attempted to be regressed?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Are you worried about the impact on you of these unrecovered... memories?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Bring it on. It's exciting.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Oh really? So you're willing... Are you willing to be regressed?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I would... I'm very... would be very hard to hypnotize. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. This is something you know about yourself?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Would you be willing to try it?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Sure.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Good.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: As long as it's here.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Here in Pahrump, Nevada? Or here in your house?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Here in my house.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh. Why is that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: This house is a sanctuary for me.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I can relax here like I can relax no other place. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You said you travel around the United States from time to time. Do you have memories come back to you when you're traveling?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: [shakes head No.]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do you feel threatened when you're outside this area in some way?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No. What happens is... I have severe post traumatic stress disorder and I take many precautions to make sure that I'm never in a place where I can be by myself, at night particularly. Or if I go somewhere, I meet somebody. But I always have to call when I get home for them to make sure I got home.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Because? What might happen?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: If I get triggered and I don't have an anchor like Dunc or my son, I don't know what I would do.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Is this because of your memories of Vietnam or because of what you <em>don't</em> remember about Vietnam?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I think it's more because of what I don't remember. Dunc can relate an incident that he had in... Lexington?... At the coffee shop.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: He'll relate that later... that I have absolutely no memory of.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So, do you have missing time? In your everyday life?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Not that I've been able to notice. But I have noticed that if I'm working on a computer... Time, to me, is meaningless, really. I've stayed up for days.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So you have good concentration ability?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I can get absolutely waylaid on things, can't I?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: [laughing] Oh yeah. [both laugh]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. You know, I'm going to tell you my impression. You sound like you're used to giving orders. Were you on a high rank when you were in the military? Or ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Staff sergeant.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Staff sergeant. So that&lsquo;s not <em>that</em> high. Right? In terms of military hierarchy?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So I'm just wondering where that might have come from if there's something... because you said you work with computers. You build them and rebuild them?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Build and repair them.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Repair. Does that come from the military, that training?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Some of it did.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Some of it. Were you in... You were in black projects. So they were top secret. So you had access to information but you don't remember the information?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: None of it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Is it like your memories have been wiped?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I would have to say that yes, they wiped memories. Otherwise I can recall things happening back to when I was three years old.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But you can't recall ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: There's a lot of time in the service I have to question where I was and what I was doing. And that just surfaced over the last, well, since my son was 9. Twenty... He'll be 36. Say, 25, 26 years, I've had to question, &ldquo;<em>What did I really do?&rdquo;</em> </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do you have any idea what you did?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Well, it would have to be that I wasn't a nice guy.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. I'm getting that.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And I <em>really don't know</em>.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: But I have this very vivid memory of Dunc.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And memories of seeing John... in Saigon. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Uh huh. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: But there's other memories that I've had corroborated where I was actually attached to a swift boat base. When the base got hit one time, I was the last person off the base and I come off a pier, caught on the life rail which is two feet above the deck which is two feet above the waterline, caught that, slammed my knees into the transom and they pulled me up on the boat and I laid and cried for two hours. I have that memory.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Where was that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Quinyon.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Where is that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Vietnam.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Right in the center of the coast.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So, you must have been pretty young at this time, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Yeah. That happened in 1967, so I'd have been 26.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So you came from a military family? Does that ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No. I can from a Sicilian family.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Sicilian family? OK. [Duncan laughs] OK. But your family was in the military?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: My brothers were.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But not your father?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: My father... No. My father owned a store, a garage, a bakery, two appliance stores.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So your mother said that you were going to remember some things, but that your memories that you have were not accurate, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: That's correct.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But she didn't want to tell you anything else?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: She just smiled.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Did you quiz her?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: When my mother gave you that smile, you didn't ask questions. [laughter]<br>    .<br>    K: So what do you think happened? Do you have any idea? I mean... Is your mother still alive?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Unfortunately my mother died in 1993.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And you have a friend named John who, I'm assuming was also in the military with you? Or with Duncan?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: We're not... He had to be in the military, but we're not sure of who he was attached to.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: I ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: He has memories. Are his memories clear, or not?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Actually no, because he was asking me about some of the things. And I have vivid memories of being maybe 13, 14, and in a lab-type setting and John was in uniform. And there was a couple of other uniforms there as well. And he was basically trying to give me an order.<br>      <br>    And I had pushed one of the other kids out of the way and was up in his face. I mean I was just all over him. And the other guys, the high ranking people, were just eating it up. I mean, they were laughing their butts off. 'Cause here's this little 13 year old kid with an afro halfway down his back up in, you know, a military guy's face just going to town on him. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And like we talked earlier about putting the puzzle together. We all have different memories. Some of them are almost identical and some aren't. And when we set down and we start talking and we put 'em all together, then they start to make sense.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You guys act like you've known each other forever.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Yeah. I know.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: We have. [laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: [to David] How long have you been out of the military?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Since November... October 15 of 1968.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: How long have you felt that you didn't have memories?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I wasn't aware of that really until my son ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ...asked you that question.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: ...in 1980.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: 1980. So, wow. Some time went by before you realized there was a gap.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And then I never realized what PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] was about. But looking at it now and with the research I've done into how it affects me personally, I can look at events that happened in my life, particularly after I got out, where it affected me so greatly that it affected my advancement in different companies.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: How does it manifest?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: What happens is... What had happened... I would come in my house. If I felt being triggered, I'd come in my house, close my blinds, close the drapes, lock the door, bring the dogs in and get my guns out.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Oh really. OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And nothing ever happened.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: [laughs] I'm not laughing because I think it's funny. I'm laughing because that's almost exactly what I would do.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Oh really. So you have something similar. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Yeah, except I didn't have the animals, but I would go into a room, put a loaded pistol on my desk and just sit in the dark and wait.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Happened numerous times.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And what happens is that night I have... I will have nightmares on more than one occasion. But with my animals, particularly with my... with this young Native American dog named Herky... He puts his paws on the bed and licks my face. If he has to come around the other side of the bed, he'll do it. And because I know he's there as a safety for me, I can wake up and I say, &ldquo;<em>OK, I'm awake. What was I doing</em>?&rdquo; And sometimes I get up, there's no clothes on the bed. I mean, they're just gone. Pillows are gone. They're gone. Dogs are on the floor looking at me like, &ldquo;<em>What did you do</em>?&rdquo; [laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do you feel like you have special skills that you didn't know you had, the way Duncan does? 'Cause I see that you collect swords. Do you know how to use them?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Have you been trained to use them... in your conscious recall?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Really? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: [to Duncan] You can ask him.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: It's identical. There is something that we all seem to share in common is knowledge of blade weapons, how to use swords, how to use knives, how to fight with them, defend against them. As a matter of fact, with the katanna [Japanese word, samurai sword] I've had, to my memory, to my knowledge, no official training. Yet when I go to a kinjitsu dojo and work out with one of the instructors, the first thing they say is, &ldquo;<em>How did you learn to combine two different styles of jinjitsu</em>?&rdquo; And I don't know. Here we go again.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: [to David] You look pretty... like you were strong. You're still strong. OK? At this age, whatever age you happen to be.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: 66</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. You appear to be a very strong man and I'm just wondering if you were aware that you might have been unusually strong in your earlier life.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Fear will do that to you.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: That's the only thing I can say, is fear will do that to you.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh. Because you... OK. Do you know how to defend yourself?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Yes. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. You know how to defend yourself using swords, but you don't know how you learned it, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: That's correct.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: I assume you know how to use guns.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I have a passing familiarity with weapons. [Duncan laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. I think you're a master of the understatement, as they say. I'm getting that.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Me?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Yeah.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: I'm not touching that.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Want to see my paintball gun? [laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You know, I'm not sure I want to see any of your guns, to tell you the truth. Where did you learn to use the guns? Do you have conscious recall of that from the military?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I recall my brother, my oldest brother, coming home from the Marine Corps with a .22 target rifle when I was about six. And he taught me how to shoot. And I just... I got pretty good with it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: How good?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Good enough that I'm still here.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Were you good at targets? You know what I'm saying? Is ..</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: It doesn't matter if the target is a target or a human being. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: When you're in combat it's like you're up against a 2-dimensional figure that can kill you. What you think takes an hour might have been two or three minutes. You become hyper-alert. And I have recalls of fire-fights that went on. And I'm still here.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do you have... Were you trained as an officer? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No. Not to my knowledge.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Not to your knowledge. You know how to drive a boat?... I don't know... or a ship, or, you know ...? [Duncan laughs] What's funny about that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: My father had boats. He had cabin cruisers. He had race boats. I was raised around boats.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I was raised around all kinds of vehicles. There isn't too much I can't drive.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. [Duncan laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I don't pilot a plane worth a damn. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I've never had a desire to pilot a plane or helicopters. [both laugh]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. You go to movies, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Oh, you don't. You're like Duncan. You don't go to movies ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I don't watch war movies. I don't watch adventure movies. Because that triggers.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Yep.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What about underground bases? Do you have any knowledge about that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I have... No. But I have heard from more than one source that you can go from the coast by Los Angeles almost to the middle of the country in a submarine.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You were in the military but your skill is in the computer world ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No. I really didn't get... I got acquainted with computers when I was in the service. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: At that time my forte happened to be electronics, electronic warfare, intelligence. [smiles and pauses, considering]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What? What's crossing your mind right now that you don't want to talk about?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Oh, nothing important.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. Now, are you... have you signed a secrecy oath of any kind? To your knowledge.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No, but I probably did.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do you recall anything that's top secret that you're not saying or that you don't tell people?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Oh, outside of that I intercepted and identified a lot of signals as to platform when I was in the service. Electronic warfare was what I was really good at. I could hear a signal across the room and tell you what it was, and if I knew what part of the country, I could probably say what platform it was on.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Hmm. Interesting. What about psychotronic warfare?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: [very somberly] It's a very real thing.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do you think you were involved in that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I almost would have had to have been. But do I have any memories of it? No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But you think you're knowledgeable about it. [Duncan laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I'd say I was knowledgeable about it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. When you heard Duncan's story, does it trigger something in you?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: At times it will. What's interesting is we both have experienced psychic attacks, and I mean, just vicious attacks, to where they will keep us up for days.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Are you psychic?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Where were you at a quarter to two, Tuesday? [Very long pause, no answer from Kerry] What part... where were you geographically at a quarter of two?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Um... pretty close by. [looks off camera] We were getting here, weren't we? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: How close were you to Shoshone? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: We were in Shoshone at one point.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: You drilled it. OK, you drilled it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I said, &ldquo;<em>They're very close. They're in Shoshone</em>.&rdquo; [Kerry nods head yes.] At a quarter of two I walked out.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So you're saying .... Have you studied remote viewing?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: To your knowledge, have you studied remote viewing?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And is it frustrating to you, not to know what happened to you?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: It's not?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And let me tell you why it's not. I believe that those memories will be revealed when the proper time comes to me, or if I dig enough. I keep myself busy with my dogs, my wolves, and computers and I have good friends who know me. They don't always understand me, and that's not important to them.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Now you have memories that you've shared but you don't know what they were. They were, surrounded, Vietnam and... Anything else besides Vietnam?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: St. Thomas.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: St. Thomas. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: St. Thomas.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: We had to go down to St. Thomas on business. And we're walking up through the market place and there's an island off St. Thomas that we both knew.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And as we were walking in the marketplace, this woman looked at Duncan and said, &ldquo;<em>I haven't seen you in many years, and I haven't seen </em>you<em> in about 20</em>.&rdquo;</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow. So you were both recognized.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Yes. <br>      <br>    Duncan: Yep</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: By more than one person.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And that... We talked about it and I had no conscious recollection of any of these people. And we looked at this island and I said, &ldquo;<em>On the other side of that is a training base.&rdquo;</em> </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Uh huh. And there was.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: And there was.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What military occupied it?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: We're not sure.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: We're not sure. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Really.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Honestly I don't think it was standardized military.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No. It was... Our best guess would be that there is a group within the military that engages totally in psychological warfare, psy warfare.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: St. Thomas. You don't know what kind of military or black projects are going on there now?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: No. But I have noticed that I've been on battlefields in many parts of the world. And I can walk across those battlefields and I can experience and hear in my mind... It was like... which was pointed out to me when a friend and I were walking Pickett's Charge in Gettysburg and I looked Lynn and Lynn had looked at me and we were both crying because it was so... War is such a <em>pitiful</em> thing, caused by bankers to enrich companies and themselves. There's never been one logical reason for a war. Not one. And the war on terrorism, to me, is a farce. It's about controlling this country and setting it up for the New World Order.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You're an electronics expert. Do you think you're being watched or tapped into?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: There's no doubt in my mind. And you know what? I really don't care.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Do you find yourself knowing things you didn't know you knew, in terms of electronics?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: [looks at Duncan and laughs] </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Yes. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: I would like to understand all that I know.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[both men pause, look off camera, from where a sound has just come]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Pulse went through the speaker.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Yep.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: The TV just went on by itself?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: No. A pulse went though... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: A pulse went through. A psychic pulse was fired at this house.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Just now?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Is that what that sound was?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Yeah. I wonder if you're recording anything.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You're convincing me that you go back a long way. What happened after that that would be an association between the two of you?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Let me let Duncan explain something to you. He ran into a gentleman at a coffee shop in Lexington, Kentucky.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: It was, uh... I can't remember exactly where it was. I know it was Lex, but I can't remember. I was sittin' there just having a cup of coffee. Guy comes up. In a suit. Sits down. And he looked at the tattoo and he said, &ldquo;<em>Is that a military tattoo?&rdquo;</em> And I said, &ldquo;<em>No, that's my own little design,&rdquo;</em> like I always say. And he said, &ldquo;<em>Well I spent some time in the Navy.&rdquo; </em>And I said, &ldquo;<em>Did you ever hear of Dave Corso?&rdquo;</em> And he backed up and said, &ldquo;<em>Dave Corso? You know Dave Corso?&rdquo;</em> I said &ldquo;<em>Yes sir, I do.</em>&rdquo; And he just gets up and walks off.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Come on. You're psychic. What was your impression?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: He was scared. The man was terrified.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: He's not the only person who's come up to you, or you've told, that you've met... because you started to tell another incident.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan: Right. And I am totally blanking on that one and this happens from time to time. And I remember telling you about it, but from there it's just totally blanking out.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: [to David]: What do you remember about it?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: That somehow my name got mentioned and the guy said, &ldquo;<em>Dave Corso?</em>&rdquo; And he described me down to the tattoos to Dunc and said, &ldquo;<em>That was the best Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam.&rdquo;</em> And I have absolutely no knowledge of it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: But, another thing that's interesting about Pahrump... There's over 200 vets, Vietnam vets, that live in the hills around here. In this valley there are over 800 ex Special Forces types.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So it attracts that ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: It is the largest known contingency of any location where there's that many ex Special Forces types.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Well this has been a fantastically interesting exploration and you know, you guys are really revealing a lot of trust to allow us to come into your house, you know, under these conditions, and ask you these question. And I just want to really thank you both.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David: Don't expect your life to become any easier.</font><br>    </p>    <p><font color="#FF9900" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="left"><strong>_____________________________</strong></font></blockquote></blockquote><div align="center">     <div align="center"><br><table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                          <!--DWLayoutTable-->                          <tr>                            <td width="350">                          <div align="center">                                  <table width="425" border="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                                    <tr>                                      <td bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>                                          <font color="#990033">Support Project Camelot - make a donation:</font></strong></em></font></p>                                    <div align="center"><a href="https://projectcamelotportal.com/donate.html"><img src="x-click-but21.gif" width="110" height="23" alt="Donate"></a>
