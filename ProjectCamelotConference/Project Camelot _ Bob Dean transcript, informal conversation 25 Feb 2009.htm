This was when my son was                    assigned at Whidbey Island. His squadron was there. Whidbey                  Island is off the coast of Seattle there in Puget Sound. Beautiful                  place.

It                  was kind of a sad story because my wife, Eric&rsquo;s mother,                  and I were in the process of getting a divorce and we&rsquo;d                  gone up there to share that with Eric, to lay it out why we                  were divorcing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyhow,                    during the cookout and the party and we&rsquo;re all                  having a few, I bring up the subject of submarines, the Soviet                  submarine threat, because I&rsquo;d been reading about it,                  you know. The Soviets had been building massive <em>Typhoon</em> type                  subs. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I asked the young man at the time, I said: <em>Are you                    guys able to stay on top of those things?

The                  state of the art in those days was that they would drop these                  electronic, electromagnetic buoys, and then the buoy would                  radio to the plane and the guys were flying around in the planes                  monitoring the buoy and the buoy&rsquo;s telling them what&rsquo;s                  underneath. You know that story.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill:&nbsp; What                year was this?

And every time they&rsquo;d take up station,                  we&rsquo;d know exactly where they were.

And I believe it                  is because they are trying to find the way underground, not                  just to an underground base or to create one, but to the actual <em>underground.</em>                  And they&rsquo;re trying to see if it&rsquo;s real.
