KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  Alfred Webre is the originator of the term
&quot;Exopolitics&rdquo; -- for those of you that don't know that,
and he's actually a &quot;futurist&quot;; he's an amazing thinker. He
was in this field doing things and thinking things before most people
had any idea, even in UFOlogy, how to really think about this whole
concept that we are not alone in the universe. So I just want to give
kudos to him and really honor him for that.

<br><br>

He's
also been...um&hellip;how do I put this? He's undergone heavy-duty
surveillance and other kinds of <I>things</I>.
He is Canadian, but obviously, he was on the target list for the
Powers That Be for quite a long time, and actually, he's had to
weather all kinds of stuff that he doesn't even talk about. I know
this because of my intuitive ability, but also because I followed his
work, actually, long before Camelot. So I just want to really honor
him for that.

<br><br>

Other
than that, I think we can just give him the microphone and let him
begin to talk &hellip; because he's very knowledgeable in so many
ways.
<br><br>

KC:
 [to Alfred] Are you hooked up here with this?
<br><br>

ALFRED
WEBRE (AW): Yes, am I?  [applause] Oh. Great&hellip;okay!  [applause]


<br><br>

Thank
you very, very much, Kerry, and I want to thank Project Camelot who
are really providing, I think, in my humble opinion, a leading edge,
if not THE leading edge platform for whistleblowers to come forth on
the issues that will create a positive future for us.

<br><br>

And
on that note, that's the note that I'll be sharing with you in a
PowerPoint on Solar Cycle 24. Solar Cycle 24 is the one that's just
starting now &ndash; 2009 to 2020, and
by 2020, we'll be roughly into the beginnings of a <I>Golden
Age</I>. So, I know that it's very hard to go from &ldquo;the problem
statement&rdquo; to <I>a Golden Age,</I> but that's roughly the
process that we're in now.

<br><br>

If
we look at Solar Cycle 24, which we'll be seeing all the graphs and
pictures of, the <I>solar maximum</I> will be in 2012 to 2013,
specifically, some say, in May of 2013. What that means &ndash; and
we'll share some of this &ndash; is that there's the <I>Index of
Human Excitability</I> which has been plotted by a Russian scientist
going back to 500 BC. What he's plotted is that about 80% of the
revolutions, the wars, and the breakthroughs in human society at the
collective level, happened at the <I>solar maximum</I>.

<br><br>

[Kerry
and Alfred spend a few minutes testing the PowerPoint] Thank you,
Kerry. [applause] Thank you.

<br><br>

Well,
as we were saying, this presentation... and there are about 60 slides
here, so I'll tend to go through them on a relatively quick basis,
following the trend from 2009 to 2020, and we'll be going kind of on
a macrocosmic scale on much of this.

<br><br>

[slide
of Milky Way] That's the picture of our own Galaxy, the Milky Way
Galaxy, and we'll also be getting into the axis of which is a
Galactic Center black hole at the center of our Galaxy. And now it
turns out that science is discovering, as you might have suspected, a
<I>universal</I> axis... not only a galactic axis but a universal
axis.

<br><br>

So
the synchrony that we're going through now is occurring, not only at
the individual level, at the planetary level, at the solar level, at
the galactic level, but at the universal level.

<br><br>

So,
it's not only just us here &ndash; it's HUGE! And the universe is
really the source of our thoughts. We just think that we have private
thoughts, but it's coming at the galactic level and at the universal
level. So, one message for that is - RELAX and ENJOY IT! [laughs
along with audience]
<br><br>

[Slide
titled: <I>Exopolitics:
2009 &ndash; 2020, Solar Cycle &amp; A Golden Age,</I>
Alfred Lambremont Webre, JD, M.Ed. <A CLASS="western" HREF="https://www.exopolitics.com/" target="_blank"><U>www.exopolitics.com</U></A>
showing the topics listed below.]
<br><br>

Now,
we'll be covering:
I.
 Solar Cycle 24, which is <I>a perfect storm</I>
II.
Galactic Alignment
III.
Exopolitics &amp; the <I>Time Acceleration Matrix</I>.

<br><br>

Time
is actually accelerating as we speak, as we sit here, because time is
not a constant; and Exopolitics is the new political science of outer
space. It&rsquo;s the science of relations between our human
civilization and other civilizations in the multiverse.
<br><br>

We&rsquo;ll
be talking about:
IV.
Positive Outcomes of Solar Cycle 24 and
V.
Strategies &amp; Solutions
<br><br>

[slide
of NASA data] Well, welcome to Solar Cycle 24, 2009 to 2020. There
are many predictions of what the amplitude of Solar Cycle 24 will be,
as you can see from this graph by NASA. Some think that it&rsquo;s
going to be very low amplitude and some think that it&rsquo;s going
to be very high amplitude &ndash; so we&rsquo;re in a position of
maximal uncertainty now.

<br><br>

Although
some information about Solar Cycle 25 is coming in, most of the
predictions are only within this cycle, that is, 2009 to 2020, and so
I like focusing, amongst many other reasons, on Solar Cycle 24 (2009
&ndash; 2020) because it gets us out of the 2012 <I>meme</I> and
says: <I>Hey, it&rsquo;s a cycle. </I>[laughs]
<br><br>

Okay.
Right now we&rsquo;re in a <I>deep solar minimum</I> and there&rsquo;s
about a 50-year low in solar wind pressure. What this means is that
there will be fewer geomagnetic storms that theoretically can affect
all the computer equipment and satellites and other things that we
have here on Earth.

<br><br>

We
continue to be in a deep solar minimum and the Sun&rsquo;s brightness
is dropping. We&rsquo;re in the <I>deepest solar minimum</I> in
nearly a century.

<br><br>

Sunspot
magnetism, which you can see plotted there on the graph, is on the
decline. It may be that sunspots will be <I>increasing</I> because
we&rsquo;re in such uncertainty. You can remember seeing from the
graph at the beginning that sunspot cycles may be picking up by the
end of 2009, to be followed by a solar maximum of below-average
intensity in 2012 or 2013.

<br><br>

However,
there's another view of this and that is that if the Sun continues to
become more <I>quiet</I>, we'll be going into a territory of <I>historic
minimum</I> and a quiet Sun will cause temperatures globally to take
a nosedive. This is contrary to the global warming argument. [laughs]
So, we're in a period of maximum uncertainty.

<br><br>

If
this version is coming forward, which there&rsquo;s some basis for
it... Temperatures are actually falling around the globe, not getting
warmer, and we know already that from 1998, the lower troposphere
temperatures globally have fallen around half a degree Celsius due to
the quiet Sun. So it's necessary to go deeper than the &ldquo;global
warming&rdquo; headlines to really understand the dynamics.

<br><br>

However,
if we do have a <I>Dalton Minimum</I> or a <I>Maunder Minimum</I>,
which are referred to historically &ndash; <I>low Sun minima</I> &ndash;
the main effect will be to have famine and starvation worldwide due
to shortened growing seasons and harsher weather.

<br><br>

And
so, we may be headed into what is called a <I>mini ice age</I> &ndash;
and we don't know &ndash; and we're at 2009. So that's the degree of
uncertainty. It's the principle: <I>The more you know, the more you
don't know.</I> [laughs]

<br><br>

So,
some of the evidence is that Solar Cycle 25, which will be peaking
around 2022 (it starts in 2020) could be one of the <I>weakest</I>
solar cycles in centuries, and that's connected to a possible mini
ice age. That's because the conveyor belt system on the Sun is
beginning to weaken.

<br><br>

Now,
in the midst of all this, we have a National Academy of Sciences
report from January &rsquo;09 which says that 2012 to 2013, the solar
maximum, may actually bring <I>the perfect storm</I>... in other
words, solar flares and systems collapse of our current
infrastructure around the planet &ndash; our energy infrastructure.

<br><br>

The
National Academy of Sciences report looks at the possibility that if
we do have a repetition of the 8-day 1859 <I>Carrington Event</I> &ndash;
a very large solar flare that essentially destroyed the telegraphic
system worldwide, which was the electrical system at that time &ndash;
in the US the damage could be as high as $2 trillion, with millions
dead (this is from the report itself), and it's questionable whether
the US would ever bounce back. Now, we're talking about 2012 to 2013.


<br><br>

Moreover,
NASA has now discovered that there's a hole in the Earth's magnetic
field which is ten times as large as was previously thought. The
magnetosphere is what protects the Earth from the impact of solar
flares, and it could be that up to 20 times the amount of solar
plasma could enter the Earth than before. So we have a
force-multiplier of a solar flare with a hole in the magnetosphere
here... looking at the &ldquo;<I>worst case scenario&rdquo;.</I>
<br><br>

We're
looking at a solar maximum which will be around May of 2013, and one
scientist says: <I>It's the perfect sequence for a very big event if
a solar flare should load the magnetosphere with plasma just before a
solar storm occurs.</I>
<br><br>

We
have to remember that we're in a <I>deep solar minimum</I>, which
tends to lessen solar storms, so there are all these variables that
are occurring at once.

<br><br>

[slide]
This is a map from the National Academy of Sciences study which shows
<I>total collapse.</I> The orange areas on both coasts show the total
collapse of the electrical grid, and the red [areas] are vulnerable
transformers. This is where the estimate of &quot;millions dead&rdquo;
has come from &ndash; knocking out about 300 key transformers,
cutting power to 130-million people.

<br><br>

AND,
the coronal mass ejection from the 1859 Carrington Event arrived on
Earth faster than our early warning system now.

<br><br>

China
and Europe are equally vulnerable. China&rsquo;s actually installing
a high-power electrical grid that is more vulnerable than that of the
U.S. and Europe, and the other developed nations will be similarly
impacted. What's important is that, as far as a reality check, the
head of the European Space Agency / Space Weather, says: <I>This is a
fair and balanced report.</I> So, that's some of the possibilities.

<br><br>

[slide]
Now, these are the G-20 with the Queen. If we look at the Obama White
House website and ask about 2012, 2013, the only thing that is on the
website as far as energy policy is that the U.S. wants to ensure that
ten percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012.
So that's a policy statement, and this is <I>entirely</I> off the
radar.

<br><br>

So
here's a key question. Obviously, if we had smart leadership at the
helm of the planet, we would be getting off the grid and we'd be
using some of the non-polluting zero-point energy sources such as
anti-gravity technology and important teleportation technology which
would revolutionize transport on this planet and which are available
now on an operational basis in the black budget economy.

<br><br>

So
the question is: Are we being set up to fail and suffer an effective
systems collapse if the 2012 to 2013 solar flares materialize?


[slide]
Now, here are some other impacts &ndash; the effect of Solar Cycle 24
on human behavior and that is that sunspots give off solar flares
that increase negative ionization on Earth, and increased negative
ionization during <I>sunspot maximum</I> periods increases human
excitability and activity. So, some of the regularities in studying
past solar cycles is that there&rsquo;s a definite tendency for
pandemics to occur during <I>solar maxima.</I>

<br><br>

Now,
the current H1N1 virus may be being manipulated, <I>and</I> it's
being manipulated at a time in which, if we go back centuries, we
know that there's a tendency for pandemics to occur. And this is
dating back to the early 1700's.

<br><br>

So,
if there is an attempt in the H1N1 virus and the mandatory
vaccination scheme, then it's truly diabolical because people are
working with historical data that shows that there is a tendency for
pandemics to occur.

<br><br>

Some
of the research shows that geomagnetic storms cause different
reactions, primarily in males. Women seem to experience less change
in accordance with the Sun's behavior. Men may become increasingly
irritable and aggressive &ndash; either that or they become more
<I>creative</I>. [laughs] So, there's a definite choice [laughter] to
be made there.

<br><br>

But
this brings us to the <I>Index of Human Excitability,</I> which was
developed by a Soviet professor. He traced the incidence of wars,
revolutions-rise, expeditions, and migrations from 500 BC to 1922 AD.
<br><br>

What
he shows is that... He divided them into four periods and showed that
in period Two and Three &ndash; which correspond to 2010 to 2011,
which is coming up in this next year; and 2012 to 2014 &ndash; there
is, to take the maximum... In 2012 to 2014 it's the maximum
excitability: the election of liberals or radicals, mass
demonstrations, riots, revolutions, war, and the resolution of most
pressing demands. So that's what has occurred historically during the
<I>solar maxima.</I>

<br><br>

Now,
there is (and we don't have time to get into it today) but we do have
another PowerPoint which shows the effect of a spaced-based weapon of
mass destruction known as HAARP, which you may have heard of, and its
demonstrated mood and mind control ability. So, we don't know.

<br><br>

HAARP
is another variable which may be off-setting the effects of the <I>Index
of Human Mass Excitability</I> and the effects during the <I>solar
maximum</I> of sunspots, in that HAARP can render entire populations
extremely apathetic and confused. There's deep evidence that that is
occurring. We may have intersecting variables here. One reason why
our body politic is so apathetic [is] sources from systematic mind
control through technologies such as HAARP.

<br><br>

But
it's also related to the sunspot cycles in that we're in a deep <I>solar
minimum</I> now. I mean, there's all these outrages happening and the
human population seems relatively apathetic, to begin to move around
it.



But
this data is very hopeful because if we have a rapid swing in
sunspots over the next few years, it will be, hopefully, not the time
for wars, but the time for social breakthroughs.

<br><br>

This
brings us to several possible visions that we can have of Solar Cycle
24, 2009 to 2020.

<br><br>

<I>The
Disintegration Vision</I> is global and regional wars &ndash; the
Armageddon <I>meme</I>. This is the <I>meme</I> employed by the
Permanent War Economy, whose business it is to promote war as an
industrial activity and to keep us organized around war within the
dialectic of &ldquo;enemies&rdquo;; to have all of our productive
capacity, and our mental capacity, and our emotional capacity (our
fears) directed towards war... which is an industrial activity, like
making shoes.
<br><br>
</p>
<UL class="style7">
	<LI>
	The
	collapse of the world energy grid, which we&rsquo;ve talked about,
	from solar flares.

	<LI>
	The
	collapse of the global financial system, which George [George Green]
	talked about earlier today.

	<LI>
	The
	collapse of nation-states. One prominent example is that of the
	U.S., and there's a <I>meme</I> now to deconstruct the U.S. as a
	nation.

</UL>

<p class="style7">
I
should say that back in the mid-&rsquo;70's when I was a futurist at
Stanford Research Institute, that was being actively studied there &ndash;
that is, the break-up of the U.S. into about five or six
region-nations. And so, in my mind, there's a question as to whether
that's an attempted social engineering to deconstruct what is one of
the advanced democracies that <I>could be</I> a positive force.
<br><br>
</p>
<UL class="style7">
	<LI>
	Ecological
	collapse - we've heard about the world's oceans, the ozone layer,
	etcetera.

	<LI>
	Pandemics
	- those that are engineered and those that occur normally because of
	our relationship to solar activity which may make extra-planetary
	interventions from causing those.
	<LI>
	Earth
	changes - vast Earth changes in terms of earthquakes, the migration
	of planets, the moving of the tectonic plate system.

</UL>
<p class="style7">

Is
this the outcome of Solar Cycle 24?
<br><br>

Well,
there's an alternative vision. It's kind of <I>Is the glass
half-empty or the glass half-full?</I> Or <I>rose-colored Glasses</I>
&ndash; and that is <I>peaceful conflict-resolution.</I>

<br><br>
</p>
<UL class="style7">
	<LI>
	What
	if human consciousness is shifting during this period such that the
	Permanent War Economy cannot manipulate us into war? And, instead,
	our political systems move to peaceful conflict-resolution as a
	modality; the emergence of new forms of world public order which are
	positive, not kind of the New World Order of the Third to Fourth
	Reich variety.

	<LI>
	The
	emergence of money as a public utility.

</UL>
<p class="style7">

Right
now, money is actually the private property of a very small group of
people. The U.S. dollar until now has been the reserve currency for
the world, but the dollar bills that you have in your pocket are
actually the property of the Federal Reserve Bank &ndash; you only
have a temporary license to use them.

<br><br>

The
Federal Reserve Bank, according to a 1976 U.S. Senate sub-committee
study (which we have online; just google <I>911 War Crimes
Tribunal</I>)... the Federal Reserve Bank is actually beneficially
owned by one family and that's the Rothschild family which is
headquartered in London and France.

<br><br>

This
is a very grounded study which was done of the ownership of the banks
that in turn own the Federal Reserve System. So we have one family
that owns all of the currency in the world, and the currency itself
is private property of that family.

<br><br>

Well,
in fact, <I>money</I> should be a public utility like electricity or
like water. With public central banks, then, if you wanted to start a
business, well the bank would just provide money to you in the same
way that it provides electricity to your workshop, and water, and
public transportation. So it's a whole transformation that can happen
with regard to money.
<br><br>
</p>
<UL class="style7">
	<LI>
	Ecological
	energy. Right now, the black budget economy runs on the basis of
	<I>teleportation</I> and that's a very efficient transportation
	mechanism.

</UL>
<p class="style7">

We've
built these concrete roads which take away all the green space,
cities are designed around the automobile, and we're using explosions
and polluting fossil fuel to move these heavy hunks of steel to
transfer maybe one or two persons.

<br><br>

Well,
<I>teleportation</I>
is an actual mechanism now. If you go to <A CLASS="western" HREF="https://www.examiner.com/" target="_blank"><U>www.examiner.com</U></A>
, I've got a column there &ndash; just enter my name, Alfred Webre,
in the search &ndash; and this past week we released an article which
is now the number one political Examiner article in the USA. It's at
the top. It's being read more than any political Examiner article in
the U.S., and that is that two whistleblowers have now come forth and
confirmed that they have teleported from Earth to Mars and met with
Martian extraterrestrials.

<br><br>

Both
of those whistleblowers are affiliated with Project Camelot &ndash;
Arthur Neumann, who's been using a name to protect himself up until
now (Henry Deacon) and <A CLASS="western" HREF="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=VM9&amp;ei=rrgSS9akBYmXtgfEhKXrCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CA0QBSgA&amp;q=Andrew+Basiago&amp;spell=1" target="_blank">Andrew
Basiago</A>, who's a colleague of mine in the Mars Anomaly Research
Society.

<br><br>

So,
we now have definite proof and whistleblowers &ndash; a very high
level of evidence &ndash; that teleportation is being employed in the
National Security State, and that <I>could</I> revolutionize our
entire society and <I>will</I> revolutionize our society.

<br><br>

I
think I can share this because Andrew, my colleague, has now shared
it... he was enrolled as a child participant in a DARPA time travel
program by the U.S. which, the U.S. we know definitively now, has had
the ability to time travel either by <I>Chronovisor</I> -- kind of a
television or a three-dimensional hologram that looks at forward and
past scenes; and via actual teleportation devices.

<br><br>

Andrew
has been to the year 2045 and it's a beautiful Earth. There's a lot
of greenery and the cities are all kind of ecological and they're
concentrated.

<br><br>

So
we have a peaceful future, say about 30 or 40 years from now, and
it's just this transition that we're going through.

<br><br>

So,
there have been people who have been to the future on a physical
basis for the United States government, bringing back information
from the future to the past to help humanity plan for the future. And
it's quite positive.

<br><br>

So
it's important to stay focused on the fact that we're going toward a
positive future because that way we create it.

<br><br>

Now,
what we'll be seeing also is that our very DNA, as we speak, is being
transformed by cosmic forces, by the Galactic Center black hole which
is acting as sort of a gigantic laser beam [laughs] to transform our
DNA to be able to handle a <I>multi-dimensional future</I> in which
we are once again interacting with the rest of organized society in
the universe, and to also bring us into an era of <I>non-dualistic
consciousness</I>.

<br><br>

These
are some of the changes that will be occurring that we're living
through now and will be occurring during Solar Cycle 24, on an
intense basis, from 2009 to 2020.

<br><br>

So,
these can be the outcomes of Solar Cycle 24 &ndash; a <I>Transformation
Vision</I> rather than a <I>Disintegration Vision</I>, and it depends
one where one wants to put one's energy and what sort of holistic
vision one wants to maintain.

<br><br>

[slide]
Now, we should also talk about the fact that we're going through the
plane of the Galactic Center black hole. If we look at our Milky Way
Galaxy, it looks kind of like a pancake with a Galactic Center black
hole at the center. It's about 100,000 light-years across; there are
about 200- to 400-billion <I>star systems</I> in it.

<br><br>

At
the center of the Galaxy is a massive black hole, about four-million
times the density of our Sun, and that black hole spins around once
every eleven minutes, as opposed to our Earth which spins around once
every 24 hours, and our sun which revolves about once a month.

<br><br>

So
the Galactic Center black hole... and now science has confirmed that
every galaxy, most galaxies, have a black hole at their center. It&rsquo;s
like the engine of the Galaxy which at the physical level is creating
the stars and various other celestial matter and at other dimensional
levels is creating life and consciousness.

<br><br>

DNA
is being affected by the Galactic Center black hole, and our very
consciousness. We tend to think that, again, our thoughts are our
own; there are our thoughts. Our individual little radio-receptor
brains and minds are picking up a vast field, a <I>morphogenic</I>
<I>field</I>, that is being broadcast by the Galactic Center black
hole, indeed by the universal axis, at once, to ALL.

<br><br>

[slide]
This is another view of the Milky Way Galaxy. You can see how it's a
pancake with a Galactic Center black hole at the center.

<br><br>

Now,
[pointing to slide] this is the Galactic Center black hole. The plane
of our Solar System is now passing through the plane of the Galactic
Center black hole. It's a 36-year journey. It started in 1980 and
will go to 2016. So we're going through the plane of the Galactic
Center black hole right now.

<br><br>

This
Galactic alignment occurs about once every 12,800 years. [new slide]
That's another schematic which shows how the plane is going through.
It takes about 36 years.

<br><br>

There
may be Earth changes during this time. Some of the theories of the
Earth changes are interesting. One is a <I>Galactic Superwave</I>
theory, and that is looking at the Galaxy as an enormous volcano with
the Galactic Center sort of the center, and Galactic <I>bursts</I>
occur which are sent out in a Superwave fashion, taking debris and
material throughout the Galaxy.



Another
source of possible Earth changes would be celestial bodies entering
the Solar System like what occurred in 9500 BC, which is when a
portion &ndash; fragments &ndash; of this Vela supernova entered the
Solar System and apparently collided with Mars, which was then an
active, verdant planet with a common human society with our Earth,
and destroyed the ecology of Mars, so that now it&rsquo;s a very
fragile ecology. The survivors are an intelligent human civilization
living under the surface of Mars.

<br><br>

This
hit Earth also and destroyed our great maritime civilization which
Plato called Atlantis, which was the &ldquo;last world.&rdquo; So, we
humans have gone through a very severe trauma in the last 11,500
years, with the 9500 BC Solar System catastrophe.

<br><br>

What
writer Barbara Hand Clow says is that one of the reasons why we have
such genetic and embedded fear of impending catastrophe is we have
<I>catastrophobia</I> and it's the memory of the 9500 BC Solar System
catastrophe. That is, our future is going to be relatively stable -
it's our collective psyche which is unstable.

<br><br>

The
Galactic Center black hole may have energy bursts which may change,
flip, or wobble the Earth. These are the possible sources, but again
we have to look at this within the lens of <I>catastrophobia</I>.


One
researcher has codified a <I>Time Acceleration Matrix</I> for the
Galactic alignment and that is the concept that time is really
accelerating. We're in the space-time dimension and the dimension of
time is accelerating: <I>Oh My God, it's Saturday again!</I>
[laughter] You know: <I>How did that happen?</I>
<br><br>

What
he says is that we're coming into a period of human enlightenment,
the disappearance of national borders, Divinely-guided anarchy, and
the strengthening of the East. So, you know, this is part of the
thing that&rsquo;s occurring.


We're
also going through a <I>photon band</I> which may be a force to
increase our consciousness and, as we just mentioned, the rate of
change is accelerating &ndash; and that is that there will be 20
times as much change and transformation in the period February to
December 2011 as there was during the period 1999 to January 2011.
So, 20 times as much change in that single year as between 1999, when
the Internet really started in full swing, to 2011. So we're in this
<I>Time Acceleration Matrix. </I>

<br><br>

Exopolitics
is a science, and as a science of relations between our human
civilization and other intelligent civilizations in the universe,
provides a framework of interface by which our civilization, on a
societal basis, can begin to interface with other extraterrestrial
and interdimensional civilizations.

<br><br>

One
can say when positing the future that the degree of conscious
interaction and cooperation amongst human society and advanced
ethical extraterrestrial civilizations will be a determining factor
in a positive human future.

<br><br>

Right
now, there appears by the evidence to be a long-standing strategic
relationship between the Martian civilization and the human
civilization &ndash; at least in terms of U.S. bases on Mars, and
Martians openly working in Hughes Aircraft, as we have witnesses of
that.

<br><br>

My
colleague, Andrew Basiago, in 1971, in the company of his father, who
was a CIA contractor, met three Martian astronauts at Curtis-Wright
Field in New Jersey, who were visiting on a liaison mission.
<br><br>

So,
our task now is to make all of that which is occurring in the covert
world &ndash; in the subconscious, as it were &ndash; to bring it
into public light. That's part of the survival mechanism, and
Exopolitics is the conceptual structure that makes that possible.
In
fact, we can say that Exopolitics may function as the new survival
science for humanity.
<br><br>

Here
[slide] we have, for example, a crop circle pattern that seems to be
the same spiral pattern as our Milky Way Galaxy, suggesting that many
of these concepts are being played for us in a multi-dimensional way.
<br><br>

[slide]
This is the <I>Time Acceleration Matrix</I> for galactic alignment.
Dr. Carl Johan Calleman and Barbara Hand Clow have developed this,
and it begins to show by going through various eras of human history
how time accelerates. For each of these periods, there is 20 times as
much change in the next period.

<br><br>

For
example, in the <I>National</I> Period from 3115 BC to 1755 AD&hellip;
well, in the next period starting just before the French Revolution,
the American Revolution, etcetera, up to the beginning of the
Internet&hellip; well, in the <I>Planetary</I> Period there's 20
times as much change as there was during the <I>National</I>.
<br><br>

And
when we go to the <I>Galactic</I> Period, from January 1999 to
February 2011, that's when all these thoughts of the Galaxy start
coming. Humanity goes <I>Galactic</I>. We have all this interest in
<I>Battlestar Galactica</I>; everyone becomes interested in
extraterrestrial issues, on a planetary basis.

<br><br>

Well,
that's all coming from the Galactic Center black hole and from the
emanations at the universal level. There's 20 times as much change
there as there was during the <I>Planetary</I> Period in terms of
bringing us up to a frequency and knowledge and information and
cognitive basis to be able to participate as citizens of a
multi-dimensional, highly-organized, and populated universe.

<br><br>

And
that's just a prelude to the <I>Universal</I> Era, which starts at
the beginning of 2011 in terms of the broadcast. Now, some people may
be right on the broadcast. You know, we each interpret it according
to our individual transducers which are in our brains and in our
minds and in our extended bodies.


If
we look at what the Mayan calendar is, then, it's really a <I>mind-map</I>.
It's not a calendar where you want to keep time; it's a <I>mind-map</I>
because it maps what sorts of things humanity is going to have on its
mind at any particular time.

<br><br>

And
2011 and 2012 is just the start of the <I>Universal</I> era on Earth.
Those are the signals that are being broadcast from the Galactic
Center black hole, which the Mayans called <I>Hunab-Ku.</I>
<br><br>

Now,
if we just look, for example, at the <I>Galactic</I> Period, which
started in 1999, that's when the center of the Galaxy started
broadcasting the whole, the <I>Galactic</I>... Well, if you look at
the year 1999, that's when the first book <I>Exopolitics</I> was
written [by the speaker], because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
happening. [laughs] Those were the signals being broadcast by the
Galaxy. So all of this is kind of coming out in a &quot;matrix&quot;
way.

<br><br>

I
have just a few copies of this that I managed to smuggle through U.S.
Customs down to here for those who'd like to buy it... not <I>smuggle</I>.
You can't bring books through on the aircraft, but I said that they
were pamphlets. [laughter] So, there you go.
<br><br>

[slide
of chart titled <I>Time Acceleration Matrix</I>] Then we had the
first scholarly conference on Exopolitics in the year 2000 and we had
other scholars come in.

<br><br>

By
the year 2003, that's when the first nation-state, Mexico, began to
disclose its UFO/extraterrestrial files in earnest.

<br><br>

In
2004 and 2005, that&rsquo;s when Brazil, Peru, and Chile began to
disclose. The former deputy prime minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer,
gave a speech then in which he said: <I>Oh, UFO's are as real as the
airplanes over your head and the U.S. government is planning to try
to start an intergalactic war, so we have to do something about it.</I>


<br><br>

In
the beginning of 2006, the Associated Press reported that <I>Exopolitics</I>
had been nominated for Word of the Year for 2005. So, we begin to get
into the culture... these <I>memes</I> begin to get into the culture
&ndash; these <I>survival memes.</I>
<br><br>

In
2007, we had the Chicago/O&rsquo;Hare sighting. France and the United
Kingdom disclosed their UFO files.

<br><br>

We
had the former Governor of Arizona say that: <I>Yes, the spacecraft
which was a mile on a side which flew over Phoenix, Arizona, on March
13, 1997 was an extraterrestrial spacecraft and I'm sorry I did what
I did and try to cover it up!</I> [laughs] That happened in 2006.

<br><br>

In
the beginning of 2007... we could go into the Chicago/O&rsquo;Hare
sighting. This is very interesting. Just to make it brief: a 60-foot
UFO came down at United Gate C-17 at Chicago/O&rsquo;Hare Airport
(I&rsquo;ve been to that gate) about 4:00 in the afternoon. It was
witnessed by the plane, the ground crew, the tower; the FAA got
involved, and it was all over the major media. It came down there on
November 7, 2006.

<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
a theory which we wrote about, about 20 years ago, called the <I>Context
Communication Theory of Extraterrestrial Communications,</I> which is
that all UFOs are like dreams &ndash; they&rsquo;re communication
from a higher intelligent source. They&rsquo;re like dreams of
communications from your subconscious to your conscious.

<br><br>

Well,
November 7, 2006... what day was that? That was the U.S. mid-term
election in which the Neocons lost control of both houses of
Congress. And I was a civil liberties lawyer, you know, working in
that field also, and, you know, a police state was about to take over
in the U.S.

<br><br>

In
fact, that sighting on mid-term election day was when the shift
happened in both houses of Congress, and with the election then in
2008 which also brought about the collapse of the old financial
structure during what&rsquo;s called <I>The Fifth Night of the
Galactic Underworld.</I>
<br><br>

In
other words, all of these &ndash; the collapse of the economic
structure &ndash; is because things that are hierarchal and are based
on control and are not sustainable are being all collapsed now
because that&rsquo;s the programming coming out from the Galactic
Center black hole. So it&rsquo;s all happening according to a large
schedule.

<br><br>

Now,
we&rsquo;re apparently in the <I>Sixth Day,</I> from November &rsquo;08
to November &rsquo;09<I>, of the Galactic Underworld.</I>

<br><br>

What
happened on December 12, 2008? That&rsquo;s when the discovery of
life on Mars happened in the NASA photographs of the NASA rover,
<I>Spirit</I>,
which is on the surface of Mars. It photographed humanoids, animals,
structures on Mars. And you can go to <A CLASS="western" HREF="https://www.exopolitics.com/" target="_blank"><U>www.exopolitics.com</U></A>
and see scientific papers &ndash; there are over 40 documents.
They&rsquo;re all free to download.

<br><br>

So
all of this is what&rsquo;s happening according to the drivers behind
the universe at the galactic level and at the universe level. So,
it&rsquo;s <I>ALL GOOD</I>! [loud and with emphasis]
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

And
so, we can look forward to more Disclosure. We can look forward to
more positive things occurring as the old structures collapse. The
thing is not to identify and suffer for the old structures.

<br><br>

Now,
what are some of the positive outcomes?

<br><br>

Well,
Spottiswoode [James P. Spottiswoode]&hellip; and here I want to
acknowledge the research and insights of David Wilcock, who has
provided a lot of the energy and insights for looking at how these
processes are resulting in a positive future.

<br><br>

[slide]
For example, Spottiswoode, a psychologist / researcher from Palo
Alto, California&hellip; each day at that time of the day when we&rsquo;re
most aligned with Galactic Center &ndash; and you can see the spike
on the graph there &ndash; our psychic ability increases 400 percent.
So, the more we&rsquo;re aligned with the Galactic Center black hole,
and the Galactic Center, and the universe axis, the more psychic we
are, the more we are in change.



I&rsquo;ve
done meditation exercises where I meditate on the Galactic Center. I
mean, you know, [laughs] that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s coming from.
[laughter] As David Wilcock has said: <I>The energy of the Galaxy is
directly tied in with the evolution of the human species by raising
its level of consciousness. This is coming as with the certainty as
the streams flow. </I>

<br><br>

Now,
one of the mechanisms is DNA activation, and Peter Gariaev &ndash;
scientist Dr. Peter Gariaev &ndash; was able to transform a frog
embryo into a salamander by shining a laser through the salamander
embryo and re-directing it into the frog embryo, and the frog DNA
transformed into a salamander.

<br><br>

At
the Galactic level, that's what&rsquo;s occurring now. The Galactic
Center black hole is the analog to the laser, and we're being
transformed at the DNA level, so the more that we open ourselves up
to that, the easier nature can take its course.


<I>The
Galactic Centers contain the pattern to transform all DNA on the
planet and they provide a sufficiently large source of energy to
enable the transformation to take place</I>.
That's
David Wilcock expressing that realization.

<br><br>

[slide]
It's even occurring at the Galactic level, and if we look at that,
that looks like a two-strand DNA. Correct?

<br><br>

Well,
if you look at that, it's the <I>DNA Nebula</I>, which is 80
light-years long and 300 light-years from the Galactic Center black
hole. This is the first time that the DNA double helix, commonly seen
inside living organisms, has been observed in the cosmos. In other
words, our Galaxy is a living organism.

<br><br>

So,
these changes are happening at the Galactic level, and we can take
what's called the <I>transposition burst</I> as a plausible mechanism
by which the <I>Galactic</I> <I>Burst</I> can activate our DNA, which
is proved in the Gariaev experiment with the laser. So now we have a
model for this.

<br><br>

Kelleher
calls the outcome of this product a <I>light-body</I>, which is
what's been described as the dimensional existence of the
upper-dimensional ethical extraterrestrials. We're in more and more
refined energy bodies.

<br><br>

[slide]
So, what is the boundary? 2011, 2013, 2012? These are boundaries in
which these mechanisms of <I>transposition bursts</I> from the
Galactic Center are happening. And they are happening now.

<br><br>

Dr.
John Jay Harper talks about that 97 percent of our DNA is now
considered <I>junk DNA</I> and it's that<I> </I>DNA which is being
activated. So, we're receiving an upgrade from the inside &ndash;
<I>Humans</I> <I>Version 2.0</I>! [laughter]


Endogenous
DMT produced in our brains could also bring about what some people
call a <I>collective near-death experience</I> that may occur...
these are some of the factors that may occur. We'll have a collective
near-death experience and really go up into our light-bodies, our
<I>extended bodies</I>, as a species... That will be an interesting
one!
<br><br>

So,
endogenous DMT can be posited as a purveyor of the transformed
consciousness.
<br><br>

KC:
 I'm very sorry, we are at a little past 12:30. There's not any more
time to go any further into this.

<br><br>

AW:
 Okay.
<br><br>

KC:
 What we can do is, Alfred, you will make your presentation perhaps
available to people so that they can follow up on the final pages?

<br><br>

AW:
 Yeah. Sure.
<br><br>

KC:
 I'm not sure how far along we are.
<br><br>

AW:
 We're almost at the end. This is slide 53 of about 60 slides, so the
bulk of the information has been transmitted &ndash; and of the
insight. [applause]
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. We would be glad to give Alfred a couple of minutes to
actually sum up the presentation, if you'd like to do so.
<br><br>

AW:
 Sure. Well, that we are coming <I>into</I> and we are <I>in</I> an
era of tremendous opportunity which is occurring, regardless of our
individual thoughts.

<br><br>

So
it makes good sense, if one is in resistance, to change one&rsquo;s
thoughts and to really tune into what's occurring at the Galactic and
universal levels, which is part of a universe program to allow us to
come into the <I>Universal</I> Age which we KNOW, by people who have
gone to the future, physically, and come back... is going to be on
our planet by the year 2045 or 2050, which is just 40 years away. So
it's a positive future that's coming.
<br><br>

I'll
be here... I'll be in the back... I've brought some copies of the
book <I>Exopolitics</I>
which founded this whole field, and if you want more information,
please stay tuned to <A CLASS="western" HREF="https://www.exopolitics.com/" target="_blank"><U>www.exopolitics.com</U></A>.
<br><br>

Thank
you! [applause]
<br><br>

KC:
 There are some fascinating areas that could be investigated further
that he&rsquo;s been touching on and some of that information is
available from our whistleblowers on Project Camelot.

<br><br>

We
have another recent interview that talks about the Galactic
Superwave. Paul LaViolette is the scientist responsible for that
concept and he&rsquo;s done a lot of investigation. We visited him in
Greece and did a recent interview. We&rsquo;ve yet to edit it; we&rsquo;ve
been so busy, but I just wanted to let you know that that is in the
area, some of which Alfred was referring to.
