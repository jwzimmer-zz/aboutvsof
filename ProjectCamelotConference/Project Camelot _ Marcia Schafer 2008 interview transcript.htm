Cassidy                  from Project Camelot, and we're here with Marcia Schafer.                  And she&rsquo;s going                  to be telling us a little bit more about the future, possibly.                  She has written a wonderful book and she can talk about that.                And tell us what&rsquo;s been going on for the past year.</p>                <p class="style7">Marcia Schafer (MS): Well, thank you for that                  wonderful introduction <em>[laughs].</em>                  What&rsquo;s                  been really intriguing in the past year is to see the progression                  of where people were and where they have <img src="marcia_schafer_2_med.jpg" width="500" height="403" hspace="10" vspace="20" align="right">come to in such a                  short time. </p>                <p class="style7">What I do as a business consultant is that I work with people                  around the world, probably in 14 countries at this point, and                  I give them both hard business skills to get ahead, but also                  some spiritual, mystical, and esoteric knowledge so that they                  can reposition themselves to really be a new leader for the                  tomorrow that we need to have. </p>                <p class="style7">So I&rsquo;m basically planting human seeds, by giving them                  skills they need to walk into a world, to build a different                  type of future than the one that seems to be being handed off                  to us. </p>                <p class="style7">And it&rsquo;s been amazing to see the scope of the people                  who are intrigued by this and want more -- because it&rsquo;s                  not just the New Age realm and esoteric people. There is an                  entire subgroup of people waking up, making the people who                  are already aware of these types of things&hellip; Their demographic                  group, thus, is becoming enhanced. </p>                <p class="style7">Because it&rsquo;s like you have that &ldquo;middle swing                  vote&rdquo;? Well, the middle swing vote is making a difference                  and making a decision. And they&rsquo;re delving very heavily                  into wanting to know all about this greater reality, this great                  unknown that&rsquo;s out there. What does it mean? </p>                <p class="style7">So, how many people at this point have had an esoteric experience                  like: <em>I think I saw a ghost,</em> or: <em>I saw something                  in the sky,</em> and they want to know more about it. They                  want to know more about life&rsquo;s great questions, as to<em> Why                  are we here?</em> and <em>What does my life mean?</em> and                  have meaning. So we delve into the soul aspects. </p>                <p class="style7">But then we go into stage two and reposition them: <em>OK.                    So you have all this information. Now what are you going                    to do about it to make a difference?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Because that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re all here today at this                  time, is to make a difference, to help to turn a strategic                  corner on this planet. And they really embrace that, and are                  taking it very seriously. </p>                <p class="style7">And they are moving so fast in terms of their knowledge and                  awareness that some of these people are just blowing my mind.                  You know, between a week of <em>I&rsquo;m curious,</em> and                  then they call back the next week when they have a subsequent                  appointment and say: <em>I&rsquo;ve been out of my body. </em>[laughs]<em> I                  had this experience. I think there was an extraterrestrial                  here. </em>Or something.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Really.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And they need answers. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So where do you go for answers? I mean, it&rsquo;s                  not like you can really go to <em>Wikipedia</em> all the time                  to find it, [laughs] or, you know, call a friend or something,                  so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, I could recommend they go to <em>Camelot,</em> for                  one thing.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Excellent! Yes. We will do that. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s great. So you&rsquo;re working with                  executives at companies. Is this right? </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m working with executives at companies.                  I&rsquo;m working with, just, lay people, housewives. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Oh my.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got clients that range from 16 to 92,                  and everything in between.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, how do they find out about you?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; You know, I just find it amazing. They just find                  me. I have never advertised or marketed. And you&rsquo;ll often                  hear me say that Google and God are my marketing directors.                  [laughs] They just find me. It&rsquo;s like when the <em>London                  Sunday Times</em> found me, and I go: <em>How on earth did                  you ever find me?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And they said: <em>We found you on the internet.</em> They                  just did a search.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So, would you call yourself, like, a personal coach?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; No. Absolutely not. The reason why is that my executive                  background and my academic credentials are pretty substantial.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And so, you know, it may be the ego, but I worked                  hard for them, and I like to take credit for them. So I have                  a tremendous amount of knowledge. I&rsquo;m not just coaching                  people. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m giving them hands-on experience that you                  only get when you&rsquo;ve really been in certain positions                  at the top of an organization. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And, you know, I&rsquo;ve had the professional training,                  but&hellip; I mean, my God I have an MBA, but I think so does                  George Bush, so anybody can get an MBA! Forgive me.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Can we edit that out? But, you know, the fact of                  the matter is there is a lot of knowledge I have hands-on that                  really saves them a lot of time and money in terms of when                  they&rsquo;re really trying to get repositioned as to: <em>What                  am I going to do here with this business?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Real information, not just motivational coaching&hellip; Not                  denigrating motivational coaching, because there is part of                  that in there, keeping people focused. And it&rsquo;s an important                  part. </p>                <p class="style7">But really tangible, technical skills, and inside knowledge                  that you don&rsquo;t get unless you&rsquo;ve been inside an                  industry. And I&rsquo;ve worked across a span of industries                  that I can help them get positioned. But really they&rsquo;re                  mostly hungry for&hellip; They like that. But the esoteric                  is&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I was going to say. But in terms                  of hands-on, in a sense&hellip; I mean you&rsquo;re a contactee.                  You know&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; You&rsquo;re also, I don&rsquo;t know how you want                  to term it, but you&rsquo;re intuitive, psychic.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So you must give them entr&eacute;e into certain                  worlds that maybe they&rsquo;re already being in touch with?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I mean, are the people coming to you, people that                  have a background already in, you know, having anomalous experiences                  in their life? Possibly even abduction experiences? Whatever&hellip; contact                  experiences, however you want to call it? Or are they people                  that are just, you know, the blank slate coming to you saying: <em>I                  know nothing</em>, you know, <em>Enlighten me</em>?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yes, yes, and yes. It&rsquo;s amazing. I tend to                  say that I work with &ldquo;reincarnated initiates&rdquo; primarily,                  the people who are really here to be the teachers.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Oh, all right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; But, at the same time, I&rsquo;d say 20 &ndash; 25%                  of the people who come to me are just awakening and dipping                  their feet in. However, what they soon discover is, they&rsquo;ve                  had a lot of teaching in other lifetimes. And so, we kind of                  rip the veil away so that they can access that information                  and be catapulted pretty far ahead of the game&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; &hellip;by getting into those other training sessions                  from other lifetimes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But are you able to tap into their reincarnation                  history, to some degree?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Definitely. Yeah. I can even look                  at a picture, by proxy. That&rsquo;s how I work with people                  around the world. And the way I found out was quite by accident.                  A woman once handed me a picture of her daughter at lunch,                  and I said: <em>Did                  you know there&rsquo;s a man standing next to her that you                  can&rsquo;t see? </em>And I described him. And I said he was                  in the shoe industry.</p>                <p class="style7">She said: <em>My God! That&rsquo;s my father. He&rsquo;s been                    dead for two years.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Ah.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And so I also can see your soul path and your reincarnational                  journeys. So I just use the photos for people and animals and                  tap right in to them.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. So the same thing that you have access to with                  animals, you&rsquo;re tapping into with humans?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yeah. It&rsquo;s a lot faster. I have to work a                  lot harder with the animals than I do with the humans. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So that gives me information. So then your <em>life                    work</em> becomes your <em>work life,</em> which is very                    self-fulfilling, rather than just going and thinking: <em>OK,                    I&rsquo;m going to go on an interview and work for somebody                    else.</em> Or, <em>I want to be an entrepreneur</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">But people are afraid. And that&rsquo;s the biggest thing                  that people have to overcome, is their fear, whether the fear                  of the unknown, fear of going forward and being an entrepreneur;                  fear of, you know: <em>Was that an alien that I saw?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">If you have information, then there goes the fear. It&rsquo;s                  just not knowing what to expect that strips people of their                  ability to stand in full power.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So, in a certain sense you&rsquo;re assisting people                  to find their mission, and then, possibly, to execute it to                  some degree.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s very well put. I think that&rsquo;s                  very well put. And it&rsquo;s really intriguing to watch them                  around the world as they are starting to really take a look                  at the future and say: <em>This </em>can<em> happen. I </em>can<em> do                  things differently. And the future </em>is<em> going to be                  very different than what I am being given with the CNN version                  of reality that we get fed every day -- if I step out of this                  scenario that I am being fed and take back life as I want to                  live it.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And see beneath the surface to what&rsquo;s really                  going on outside of the matrix.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Absolutely. The extraterrestrial component, though,                  is such an integral part of that. And they all want to know                  more, because it really brings back our full history on this                  planet. And it brings back our potential future as we go out                  into space and enter into the next frontier. So that&rsquo;s                  a large component, also, of what people are getting involved                  in. </p>                <p class="style7">And, having had a scope of experiences, with not just one                  race, but multiple races giving me a multi-cultural variation                  to it -- different aspects of technology, holography, communication,                  different species attributes, how they tend to work with humans,                  who tends to take you on a little bit of a joy journey, who                  tends to give you more philosophical teachings. </p>                <p class="style7">Those types of thing are really helpful as people are trying                  to gain their own working-ground, and wrapping their head around                  the extraterrestrial reality.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, also, we&rsquo;re all mixtures of different                  races, wouldn&rsquo;t you say? So, I mean, you must tap into                  that.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; In more ways than you would think! In more ways                  than even the human race.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes. Well, that&rsquo;s what I meant by <em>races</em> --                  ET races, various ETs. So you must actually tap into their,                  sort of, lineage, if you will.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Oftentimes I can. Oftentimes. You know with&hellip; If                  you take reincarnation in general, for example, someone may                  have 140 lifetimes, but only 4 are really germane to what&rsquo;s                  going on right now.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm. That&rsquo;s right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And their journeys of where they may have reincarnated                  not on Earth, there&rsquo;s often -- not always -- but there&rsquo;s                  often a primary lineage that they really feel affinity to.                  Just like here on Earth, we could say: <em>Well, I really am                  more in tune with my Egyptian incarnations than I am with my                  Greek ones</em>&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly. Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; &hellip;somebody may have. And, you know, a lot                  of times there&rsquo;s no names for these races that we have.                  I can just describe where they seem to be coming from, or if                  there is something in the common vernacular, but they have                  something very strong there. But people are always positioned                  that they&rsquo;ve got to find their own answers, because this                  isn&rsquo;t empirical information.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And so, I can&rsquo;t give you: <em>In 1613</em>,                  you know, <em>there was this particular information; you can                  go look it up.</em> Or in, you know, 42 A.D. So people have                  to be tuned into their own reality and their own version of                  what feels right and what resonates.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. What resonates with them.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So, these are just like tools, and things to help.                  Here is, you know, just a cornucopia of information. If it                  feels right, take it and use it as a tool to grow. And if it                  doesn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s OK. Just discard it. </p>                <p class="style7">Because you have to be your own master of your destiny. Don&rsquo;t                  you dare hand off the keys to the car to me or anybody else! </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. Well, that&rsquo;s great to hear that that&rsquo;s                  your approach. So, in your own back-experience with the races                  that you feel affinity for&hellip;&nbsp; Are you willing to                  talk about which races you do? Because, you know, if I remember                  correctly -- and correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here &ndash; there&rsquo;s                  something with the Sirians, Andromedans, that you had some                  contact there. I know you have a real affinity for Egypt. And                  I feel I know you from Egypt, I have to say.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yeah. A lot of times when I do use those terms,                  as I pointed out, they&rsquo;re used because they&rsquo;re                  already in the common vernacular and people are familiar with                  them. </p>                <p class="style7">My perspective is, I&rsquo;ll talk a little bit about the                  extraterrestrial races, but there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s                  beyond them I think is so much more important that I get people                  focused in on. And that&rsquo;s what I call the &ldquo;Multi-dimensional                  Teachers&rdquo;, the more advanced beings who really teach                  us to become elevated, super-humans almost, to be what we aspire                  to be, and know what we can be, you know, the best of humanity. </p>                <p class="style7">Those are the ones I like to focus in on and stay in communion                  with. You really almost have to earn your privileges with them.                  It&rsquo;s as if, you know, as an average person, we would                  try to get into Harvard, where supposedly they have wonderful                  teachers there, although there are also good teachers elsewhere.                  [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; But, you know, it&rsquo;s that type of thing. I                  really feel honored when I have the ability to get communion                  and communication with them. And that&rsquo;s where I try to                  focus people, because&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. So when you say <em>multi-dimensional,</em> are                  you talking <em>light beings</em>, people that&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; You could call them that. They don&rsquo;t need                  a body.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; &hellip;beings that don&rsquo;t manifest in&hellip; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; They will use one, oftentimes, but they don&rsquo;t                  necessarily need a body. And so, they&rsquo;re what we tend                  to refer to as the Old Wise Masters, and they can take any                  form, any shape. </p>                <p class="style7">They really focus a lot on teaching the understanding of space,                  time -- which is so infantile here on this planet -- getting                  us to understand multiple perspectives, how things really work                  out there, and how to navigate beyond the human experience. </p>                <p class="style7">There is a lot to do with&hellip; when you get into the very                  controversial aspects of time and time travel. They teach you                  the truth. </p>                <p class="style7">Now truth. Really, what is truth? Truth is a matter of perspective.                  What is truth at one point and to one person, is not another                  person&rsquo;s. But I feel it&rsquo;s the closest to the truth                  that I&rsquo;ve been able to get at this point.</p>                <p class="style7">But the regular extraterrestrial races are the ones that a                  lot of people are having contacts with. You always hear about                  the Grays. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And what I like to get people familiar with is the                  fact that, with the Grays, is that they have some of the most                  tremendous powers of holography, telepathy, of all the races                  out there. And, the power of being able to get inside your                  head and anticipate what they need to do, for a scenario, to                  be able to reach out to you, or to get you to think that you&rsquo;re                  in a certain situation so that you&rsquo;re more comfortable,                  is quite powerful. And so, you want to break through that illusion. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; But I also try to get people to understand that&hellip; Stop                  looking at things from a human who&rsquo;s very stubborn, and                  try to understand why these races are working with us in the                  capacity that they are. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, what the human does is, they take themselves out of                  the placement of, <em>I&rsquo;m just another species, </em>and                  tries to put themselves as a God-like being<em>.</em> And we&rsquo;re                  not a God-like being. We are just another species in a broad                  spectrum that&rsquo;s out there. And so, when we look&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, there is also a tendency to put the alien,                  or the ET, in that position.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Very much so, because they&rsquo;re so different.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s a huge gap and a disconnect.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yeah. That&rsquo;s part of our growing up, in that                  what we have to do is to stop looking at them as Gods. You                  know, that&rsquo;s one of the most common &ldquo;Ten Myths                  of Extraterrestrial Reality&rdquo;, is that they&rsquo;re Gods                  and great beings. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not Gods and great beings. We should                  think of them as <em>life colleagues</em>. And that&rsquo;s                  how we should think of every species on this planet.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Also, they all have agendas. We&rsquo;ve got a basis                  for what you&rsquo;re doing with your contacts, and also with                  the people that you&rsquo;re consulting. You call yourself                  a consultant, right?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And so, what we want to know is, have you had contact                  lately? And what are they telling you, if anything, about what&rsquo;s                  going on here today? </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Excellent question.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Because we&rsquo;ve got an economy that&rsquo;s                  in the tank. Right? </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And people are wondering what&rsquo;s happening                  with their stocks. You know, the stock market is down, drastically                  down. We&rsquo;ve got potential war with Iran. We&rsquo;ve                  got all kinds of things going on.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re at an incredibly tumultuous situation.                  And I want to give you a kudos, because you&rsquo;re the first                  person who&rsquo;s asked me that. And you really have ask me                  questions to get a lot of information out of me. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; What has happened is&hellip; As you know from the                  last time, I&rsquo;ve been contacted since I was in the crib.                  But what they did is, they made some&hellip; What we could                  call, in an analogy, is saying I&rsquo;m <em>hard-wired</em>?                  Tapped in? And so, I have instant communication any time I                  need it to the other side. So I don&rsquo;t have to necessarily                  have an extraterrestrial visit or have them come. </p>                <p class="style7">I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone in the physical for a while. Over                  the past couple of years there&rsquo;s been a couple of attempts,                  and I&rsquo;ve closed the door -- for certain reasons -- because                  I wasn&rsquo;t sure who it was in advance. And so, that is                  something that I&rsquo;ve done in the recent years unless I                  know exactly who it is and I feel completely comfortable. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s kind of a Pavlovian response. But I always have                  access to information anytime I ask a question. It&rsquo;s                  almost like there&rsquo;s a little antenna on all the time. </p>                <p class="style7">And what you&rsquo;re asking is what I&rsquo;m getting from                  people all over the world. I mean, people are really, really                  scared, confused, not sure what&rsquo;s happening.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; But what I want to point out is, yeah, are we in                  the midst of great change? Absolutely. But you&rsquo;ve got                  to get rid of the baby teeth before the big teeth can come                  in. </p>                <p class="style7">And so what I&rsquo;m doing is getting people to look at it                  from a different perspective. I mean, we&rsquo;ve been through                  all kinds of tumultuous situations, ever since the history                  of mankind. I mean, Sparta invaded Athens. You know, the Romans                  took over England. We can go right on up through our history,                  where we felt like the world was ending and there was total                  chaos within the times, within the context of our civilization                  in which we live.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re in the midst of one of those times.                  But, instead of being terrified, we&rsquo;ve got to learn to                  let go of the things that may have not mattered so much, when                  we thought they did, and get ready for tremendous new opportunity                  to build things the way that they should be built to allow                  us to live in a society that will benefit us in a new way. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, a lot of people aren&rsquo;t going to like that because                  they like their house; they&rsquo;ve accrued a tremendous amount                  of money; they like the lifestyle they have. But the bottom                  line is the planet can&rsquo;t sustain that anymore.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. But&hellip; so you know that the Illuminati                  have an agenda. You know they&rsquo;re trying to roll that                  out as we speak. You know that there are efforts to actually                  attack Iran. So, you know this is going on in the backdrop,                  and yet you seem to be very optimistic. So when you say&hellip; Look,                  they&rsquo;re gonna lose their money. They may lose their house.                  Certainly the housing crisis is pretty phenomenal. But, what                  is the new style that you&rsquo;re sort of telling them they&rsquo;re                  going towards?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I just want to clarify this. It doesn&rsquo;t mean                  they&rsquo;re <em>necessarily</em> going to lose their money.                  But you have to be living in a time right now where we have                  to be able to surf the waves and deal with what comes forward. </p>                <p class="style7">What I&rsquo;m doing is repositioning them in terms of looking                  at&hellip; There&rsquo;s never been a better time. Oh, this                  is a horrible analogy: Think about if the carpetbaggers in                  the South were a positive thing instead of abusing the South                  the way it happened. Think if it was a positive humanitarian                  thing. </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s never been a better time to get in on the ground                  floor right now to get positioned for a different future, one                  that&rsquo;s gonna include, or go beyond, the frontiers of                  this planet, new frontiers in space. </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s tremendous advances in technology and artificial                  intelligence. There&rsquo;s tremendous changes in peoples&rsquo; lifestyles.                  There&rsquo;s tremendous understanding of the greater reality,                  which is going to be flooding in to a new degree. There&rsquo;s                  never been a better chance to be a true pioneer and be tremendously                  successful. </p>                <p class="style7">And the message I get over and over again, whether it&rsquo;s                  somebody who&rsquo;s just raising -- I shouldn&rsquo;t say <em>just</em>;                  it&rsquo;s the most important job of our generation, is raising                  kids -- somebody who&rsquo;s raising kids, dealing with a family;                  or is a small-time entrepreneur; a major CEO who&rsquo;s in                  ultimate despair. When they get off the phone with me, they                  say: <em>I&rsquo;ve never looked at life so differently, and                  I have such a different vision of the future and of hope,</em> that                  it&rsquo;s incredible. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, what I&rsquo;m doing is telling them, and showing                  them, that it&rsquo;s all about vision and how we look at it.                  And we&rsquo;ve just gotta be prepared. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, if some things are gonna happen, they&rsquo;re gonna                  happen. Some things may not happen. Some things we may make                  a difference in by doing things differently, thinking differently,                  creating this resistance to this -- as I call it; you&rsquo;ve                  heard me say before -- this CNN version of reality.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s all about&hellip; Everything I talk                  about is all about taking back our power, as human beings,                  as social beings, as cultural beings, as someone incarnated                  within the times. We now have tools that we didn&rsquo;t have                  before.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. We&rsquo;ve got an oil-dependent regime. OK?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Which we&rsquo;ve had for a very long time.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly. And so, what we&rsquo;re looking for is                  something that will change.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; New thought-forms.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; A mind that&rsquo;s open to change.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; New thought-forms.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. That&rsquo;s gonna be the bottom line, is that,                  if they&rsquo;re not willing to change the paradigm, then we&rsquo;re                  gonna get the same old, same old, same old. Right?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Well, you&rsquo;re making an assumption.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Yeah. Help me here, because if we remain totally                  dependent on oil&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yeah. If we don&rsquo;t change the paradigm, there&rsquo;s                  several things that could happen. There could be things that                  happen geologically, or geographically. There could be things                  that could happen where those who watch over us may decide                  to step in. Or may not.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. Oh, yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So, there&rsquo;s a lot of things that could happen.                  The optimum opportunity for us <em>is</em> to change the paradigm. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, the intriguing thing is I sometimes get asked: <em>Well,                    do they tell you who&rsquo;s gonna win the election?</em> You                    know. <em>Do they give you advance notice?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Whenever I get information, it&rsquo;s usually just days before                  the wire, because it&rsquo;s already written out there and                  they let me know -- which has happened in the past elections. </p>                <p class="style7">However, in this situation, what they do is, they really watch,                  because this tells them the pulse of the human being within                  the United States, as to how they make their decisions, what                  their trends are, where they seem to be putting their energies                  and information in terms of where they&rsquo;re going forward.                  Because, as you&rsquo;re pointing out, one pathway does lead                  towards openness to greater change and doing things differently.                  The other one does show more resistance. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Now, this is highly controversial, but, with the                  last series of elections that we had -- we don&rsquo;t know                  if this is true or not -- but the information I had been given                  in the 1990s was that they were intending for the early 2000s,                  particularly between 2002 and 2004, to be able to make great                  headway in terms of making themselves known on this planet. </p>                <p class="style7">But with things that took place, and the way they watched                  the populace respond to certain things that happened, it was                  decided that they were not going to shake up the planet and                  they were going to wait at that time.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. So here we are at 2008. Is what you&rsquo;re                  getting that they are going to come forward more?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I do believe that that&rsquo;s gonna happen in our                  lifetime. I don&rsquo;t get a date. I know a lot of people                  believe that by 2012 it&rsquo;s gonna happen. I can only tell                  you potentials. </p>                <p class="style7">I would expect, at the rate we&rsquo;re going, by 2016 it                  should be out in the open. Could it happen in two years? Sure.                  Could it happen in twelve years? Sure. But at this point in                  time I do not know and I&rsquo;m not going to pretend like                  I do. I&rsquo;m just looking at potentials, and the way that                  we&rsquo;re going forward. </p>                <p class="style7">Anything&rsquo;s up for grabs. But, you know, as I alluded                  to last time, you also look for indicators as to what&rsquo;s                  out there where it might happen. We are getting more into the                  open populace and more into the mainstream. </p>                <p class="style7">But, remember, I also said that one of the major triggers                  for knowing when it&rsquo;s coming soon is when there&rsquo;s                  an announcement that on another planet they found evidence                  of an ancient civilization.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; If we ever find that, then we know it&rsquo;s just                  around the corner. That may not be our pathway. They may not                  go that way with us. But I would expect &ndash; just in general                  terms as they usually do with planets opening up&hellip; it                  could happen.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. What you&rsquo;re dealing with are executives.                  As you say, there&rsquo;s a growing consciousness change.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Oh yeah. Oh yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. And you seem pretty impressed by it.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m <em>astonished</em>. I&rsquo;m not                  impressed. In the past year in the difference in my practice&hellip; I&rsquo;m                  astonished.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Well that&rsquo;s lovely.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; The people coming to me, the level of people, what                  they&rsquo;re experiencing, and once they&rsquo;re beginning                  to get some answers, put some pieces to the puzzle together,                  how <em>fast</em> they&rsquo;re being accelerated. And I&rsquo;ve                  just basically let go, and let them work with those on the                  other side who work with them.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. OK.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; These people are almost like colleagues to me at                  this point, instead of, you know, coming as initiates.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s nice.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fabulous. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes. I mean, that&rsquo;s got to be a great feeling.                  But, you know, there are ETs with what might be called a negative                  agenda, or not in our best interests. And do you make your                  clients aware of who those ETs are? Do you teach them how to                  protect themselves?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; The number one thing is teach them how to protect                  themselves, not just from ETs, but when you start opening up                  the door to the other side, anything and everything can come                  in.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So you don&rsquo;t open up the door till you know                  how to shut it. So that&rsquo;s the number one thing.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; However, I don&rsquo;t teach them, necessarily,                  this one is negative or that one is negative, because&hellip; Think                  of it, when you were a kid, you know. You had this best friend                  and your parents couldn&rsquo;t stand him because in their                  eyes they were negative, but you saw value in that person.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; There may be something there for them that I could                  be putting within this paradigm which would be, you know, unfair.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So what I do is, I give them tools of discernment,                  of protection, of what to look for. The most powerful tool                  I give them is how to use their cognitive mind along with their                  intuitive mind to look at things <em>perceptively,</em> and                  to look at this greater reality that's out there and whoever                  may be in it and be able to, let's say, vet them,                  so that they can determine for themselves, whether it&rsquo;s                  good or bad.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. Whether they're sending them on a positive                  mission, if you will.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Right, right.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Because a lot of these things go on... You know,                  Jim Sparks is one of the well-known conscious abductees, if                  you will. His recall could have, and probably does have, some                  overlays to it, even though it appears to be positive. So this                  is, you know, a huge dilemma.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Well, Jim and I had an interesting phone call, within                  the past year, I think it was. And before I tell you what else,                  there&rsquo;s one thing interesting. Those of us who've had                  experiences, that aren't just, you know: <em>Oh, I had an experience,</em> or <em>I                  saw something</em>, but have lifetime training, there are things                  we know about that only each other know. So we can, again using                  the word, vet each other very quickly. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, Jim and I realized that we could talk a similar language,                  and very comfortably, very quickly. And the thing with Jim                  is that, from what I understand, and I may have this wrong,                  but I understand that he originally looked at this negatively.                  But then he soon learned, by widening his perspective, that                  there was a greater agenda, more going on than he realized                  was going on. And he was able to look at it differently. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And so, that's one of the approaches that's really                  incumbent upon all of us to be aware of, is that we don't always                  understand what's going on when we work with these other groups.                  And that's why you have to think <em>perceptively,</em> in                  a whole new manner, and be open. But at the same time, be smart                  and not give away, you know, the keys to the vault of yourself                  and say, again: <em>Oh, they're Gods. I'll do anything you                  say.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; We need to think smartly and say: <em>Is this right                    for me? What kind of information am I getting? How does this                    integrate into my reality? Does it make sense? What am I                    going to do with it? Is somebody taking me for a joyride                    here, or what?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And so, these are the things that people worldwide                  need to know. This needs to be a part of our ET 101 education                  that we've been stripped of by not even being allowed to acknowledge                  that they exist. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly. Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So I'm doing my best to get ET 101, and 401, out                  there into the common populous for those who are open for it.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. So you're getting information yourself. You're                  dealing with people that are starting to open up, some of which                  are quite far along on the path. And then, at the same time                  we've got this&hellip; I don't know if you want to call it                  a &quot;rolling snowball&rdquo;. But whatever this is, you                  know, stuff is coming down the pike, some of which will be                  Earth changes.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I wouldn't say that very definitively like that.                  [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. Well, Earth changes, you know&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; We've had Earth changes since we've been on this                  planet. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. So don't misinterpret what I'm saying.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I'm using the term &quot;Earth changes&quot; purposefully.                  It could be small, you know. It could be a tornado, you know. </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; OK. That&rsquo;s correct. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; It could be a major change in a coastline. It could                  be a change in the amount of water, you know, inundated, certain                  areas, you know; ecosystems changing. It could be small, or                  it could be major. Right? </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So we have a gamut. </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Right. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And what we're wondering, and what I'm sure people                  out there are wondering is, to what degree, and how soon, and                  where? And this kind of thing. And what I'm wondering is, are                  you getting that kind of information? Or is it all still, you                  know, subject to change?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I am getting some of that information. It is heavily                  dependent on where the consciousness of the planet goes. And                  so, that's why it is so important to get people empowered,                  and get them to understand that they have an entrainment program                  in front of them, in terms of where their minds are, where                  their thoughts are, what they're expecting, and how that they're                  acting, is going to make a difference in what's going to befall                  them.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm. </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; It is absolutely critical. Because the way that                  I've been led to understand that time works is that this is                  going to impact which timeline befalls us, as a greater populous. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; As far as details, I'm occasionally shown some things.                  But they always, always have predicated it with: <em>This is                  a probable tendency, a probable reality. Anything can change.</em>&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; One interesting thing that I understand Edgar Cayce                  had said is that&hellip; Within the past month or two, I have                  seen some land rising off of Florida. Now whether that&rsquo;s                  going to happen, I don&rsquo;t know any more than you do. But                  I would be very intrigued. You know, that whole Bimini                  type of line, down to the Bahamas, has been shown to me as                  becoming more solidified as a potential.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Uh huh. </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; But again, I don't know. I mean, I don't know any                  more than I know which horse is gonna run at Belmont, you know,                  and win. [laughter] But I just listen to it. I pay attention                  to it, and know that it's a potential. It&rsquo;s a possibility.                  And we'll wait and see, just like the rest of us.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. So, in addition, we get, you know, because Camelot's                  now been in operation for a little over two years&hellip; We've                  got witnesses from deep black projects. We've got psychics.                  We've got intuitives. We've got, you know&hellip; covering                  the gamut, really. And the information we get coming at us                  is really amazing. </p>                <p class="style7">There's a huge amount of it which is kind of focused on what                  appears to be&hellip; if you're familiar with the Iron Mountain                  Report and with some of the agendas that they're trying to                  role out. Now, whether they&rsquo;ll be successful at that,                  of course, has something to do with the way the populace reacts,                  and the consciousness&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yes. What is the Iron Mountain Report?</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Reduction of the population through disease, you                  know, actually planted viruses. War. You know, creating what                  they call <em>chaos&hellip;</em> to bring order out of that,                  the kind of order that they're looking for. In other words,                  there is a movement to get rid of a certain degree of population.                  There are agendas out there that they're pushing along. </p>                <p class="style7">And what I'm wondering is, in your work... because these agendas...                  In other words, you can consult somebody individually on their                  life, and they can start having a much better view of reality                  and of all their potential, and, you know, want to start a                  company, let's say. In fact we just met a couple who&hellip; they're                  starting a very wonderful eco-friendly way of building houses.                  OK? Kind to the environment, you name it. </p>                <p class="style7">But they're in a dilemma right now. They've got a child and                  they feel that something&rsquo;s coming down the pike. They                  actually live already in a fairly, what I would consider to                  be, you know -- who can call anything <em>safe</em>? &ndash; but                  safe in the sense that it&rsquo;s not on a coastline. You're                  not going to have a tsunami tomorrow. This sort of thing. </p>                <p class="style7">But they feel that America has become actually, you know,                  untenable. It's not gonna be the America we knew in the past.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; It already isn't the America we knew in the past.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly. So this is worrying them. And they want                  to know what their future looks like, for their child. And                  they're actually contemplating moving out of the country to                  South America because now...</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Well, I'm getting a lot of South America. I have                  a lot of clients throughout South America.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; GREAT! Well, let&rsquo;s hear what it is&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; What would you say to these people? That&rsquo;s                  what I'm asking.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I do say what I'm about to say, because I get asked                  this every single time -- is that you are going to be guided                  to wherever you need to go. If something is gonna happen, you&rsquo;re                  gonna end up exactly where you need to go. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And it may not be, you know, heading high for the                  hills and hanging out and being safe with your family. Because <em>if</em> something <em>were</em> to                  happen on a larger degree in this country, worldwide, people                  have certain skill-sets that are gonna be needed in certain                  places. </p>                <p class="style7">So, this is where I get people to tap into their higher selves                  and their consciousness and say: <em>Just trust. Trust in yourself. </em></p>                <p class="style7">Because you weren't born to pay the mortgage. You weren't                  born to go to your kids&rsquo; soccer game. Those are things                  that come with everyday life. You were born as part of a mass                  contingency who decided to be here at a time to help enable                  a strategic turnaround on this planet. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So for God&rsquo;s sakes, listen. Listen to yourself.                  Remember who you are and why you are here. And stop worrying                  about these things. Because you'll be wherever you need to                  be, and you'll have whatever you need to do at that time.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, in terms of the population being reduced, whatever, we've                  been through that. You look at Western Europe, being wiped                  out by the black plague.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And so, you know, as many people have said before:                  How can we know our future when we don't even remember our                  past? And so, we've been through many periods of time that                  have had happen to them exactly what's happening now. </p>                <p class="style7">The difference now is we have advanced technology to understand                  it differently. We have mass communications to know what's                  happening immediately. Some people didn't know about Krakatoa                  -- which was for some the end of the world, you know -- for                  years afterwards. So, what is happening now isn't all that                  different than what's happened throughout history. </p>                <p class="style7">The difference is that we have a Mayan prophecy that is scaring                  the pants off of people. We have the world where we're able                  to see it in a way we have not been able to see it before. </p>                <p class="style7">We have environmental tragedy happening every day, with species                  disappearing, and mass pieces of land just melting away. We                  have a lot of things happening that we know about. And so,                  the environment is pushing us in a vast direction very quickly.                  And we're all able to know about this through this grand internet,                  and telecommunications...</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That's right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; ...and through our Blackberries, and whatever else                  we're using, our I-phones. So we have almost, like, everything                  that we've been through in different cycles of time before,                  coming into the greatest culmination right now.</p>                <p class="style7">The other thing we have -- and this is very controversial;                  I can't believe I'm gonna talk about it [laughs] on camera                  -- is that, when we talk about reincarnation, what I have seen                  is we have a mass contingency reincarnated again, of those                  who were at first working at the time that we know, of Ahknaton<strong>, </strong>but                  what I call the &ldquo;Jesus contingency.&rdquo; </p>                <p class="style7">There was the time, at that point, of what we've been led                  to believe was a little bit different than the religious accounts                  tend to tell us. I mean, we have to remember, the stories were                  written 70 years later, at the earliest. We have very small                  fragments of what happened. </p>                <p class="style7">But there was a mass contingency of people back at that time.                  They are all reincarnated and back here again, once again trying                  to do this amazing strategic turnaround on this planet, hoping                  for a different future. </p>                <p class="style7">But goodness! Look what happened two thousand years ago! It                  wasn't the way that a lot of people thought it was gonna turn                  out. And I don't think certainly Yeshua thought it was gonna                  turn out that way. [laughs] Or maybe the plans were a little                  different. That's very bold for me to say. </p>                <p class="style7">But I've seen this amazing contingency reincarnated again                  back here. </p>                <p class="style7">So, if we're facing a strategic turnaround, I think we have                  a well-equipped group to deal with it if they just do one thing:                  Remember who they are, come into their power, take back the                  way that they think, and not give away their power to others,                  remember the spiritual component within them, remember the                  divinity in everybody else that's out there and it's not just                  within them.</p>                <p class="style7">If this demographic group learns to link together the way                  that they're starting to, and work together, they're a bigger                  group than anybody ever would believe. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And they absolutely can do everything that's being                  asked of them to turn it around. But it's up to them. As I                  can say, I can give you an admission to a wonderful college,                  but you may not go. You may take a different pathway. That's                  basically what&rsquo;s in front of us.</p>                <p class="style7">So, our group incarnational lesson right now is to find each                  other, collaborate, work together, get rid of the pettiness                  that has plagued mankind, and start doing things on small platforms                  or big platforms -- not waiting for permission from anybody,                  just going forward and going. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Because, as a lot of your audience really tends                  to tap into, the clock does seem to be ticking at five minutes                  to midnight. And you know what? Even if we have another 17                  hours on that clock, what we need to do will be beneficial.                  So, if we have five minutes to midnight, or we have a long                  time in front of us, it doesn't matter. </p>                <p class="style7">We need to get going and we need to act. And that's why I've                  been so busy and I haven't been able to be out and talking                  to people and doing what needs to be done, is because I'm prepping                  these human seeds everywhere so <em>they</em> go out and cascade                  and reach a lot of people.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">Bill Ryan (BR): We interviewed George Green...&nbsp; In April                  we interviewed George Green, who is a contactee as well, as                  you know. And his sources tell him that it's nearly too late.                  He refers to the group of people who are aware, and alert,                  and awakened, as the Ground Crew -- it's just his typology                  for that. And he wrote a book called...</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; What a great name. I like it.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; ...<em>Messages for the Ground Crew</em>. And this                  is one of the things that inspired us to launch Project Avalon,                  which is focused on communities, awakening, resources, communication,                  networking, sharing information.&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">Are you just saying, actually, it's OK? You know, it'll all                  be fine? </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; No.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Because, whatever happens, it's gonna work out?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; No. I'm saying there&rsquo;s a call to action right                  now.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; So what is the action? If I'm watching this video,                  and I'm smart, and I'm aware, and I'm alert, I'm focused, and                  I'm flexible, now what do I do? Where do I go? What should                  my strategy be? What advice do you give me personally about                  this? Because I want something more specific, because I'm very &hellip; I                  mean, this isn't me personally speaking. But what I often do                  in these interviews is I ask questions that we're asked to                  ask. </p>                <p class="style7">We get these messages every day. People say: <em>What do I                    do? How can I help? How can I contribute? I&rsquo;ve got                    a feeling of responsibility for the human race. Tell me what                    this call to action should be. Help me                    be focused.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; On a one-to-one basis, what I do, basically, is                  that I look at what your reincarnational lessons have been.                  But then I also take a look at: What have you done in terms                  of your skill-set? Where is your knowledge? And where is your                  expertise, that we can really position you, that you are really                  gonna make a difference? But add to the mix of that: What do                  you <em>want</em> to do? </p>                <p class="style7">And usually you can take the three things, in terms of your                  life and soul purpose and lessons, your experience that you've                  garnered along the pathway, and what you want to do, and come                  up with some way to position you so that you're a New World,                  a New Paradigm, entrepreneur.</p>                <p class="style7">So it's different for every single person, you know, just                  like we have doctors, and we have pharmacists, and we have                  bicycle makers, and we have grocery store people, and we have                  farmers.</p>                <p class="style7">But at the same time, you don't look at it the way you've                  been doing it. You look at it as: How's the world changing?                  How's this 21st century vision different in terms of how the                  food delivery system&rsquo;s going to be? Are we going to be                  working off the planet? Are we going to be working on-planet?                  What kind of scarcities are there gonna be? </p>                <p class="style7">So you need to look at an entire array of situations to see                  where you have the best opportunity to be positioned.</p>                <p class="style7">A lot of times people have an inkling and they really know.                  That's when they need the hard business sense in terms of:                  OK. How do I make this happen for real, in terms of, you know,                  I need to know certain ways to get my talents out there, or                  my products out there, or my services out there, and get them                  to the people who need them? </p>                <p class="style7">Now this goes back to, again, in terms of there's this entire                  new demographic that is out there which is, I'm going to just                  boldly say, <em>us. </em>We have different appetites.                  It's like all of a sudden, you know, everyone's eating meat                  and you want sushi. [Kerry laughs]&nbsp;We have different appetites                  in terms of what we want and what we want the world to be.                  So this is where we're now feeding our own demographic group                  and creating this world that's burgeoning out.</p>                <p class="style7">So you say you want hard answers. So does everybody else.                  But it's a little bit different for each person based on&hellip; [to                  Bill] You might be best at terra-forming. [to Kerry] You might                  be best in terms of going back into, maybe L.A., and making                  some key contacts, and re-defining the vision in terms of what                  people are going to be feeding on demographically.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.<em>&nbsp; </em></p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And so, you know, I've got&hellip; I <em>do</em>&hellip; I                  have people who are working with major foundations. I have                  people who are working within Hollywood and L.A. I have people                  in major... I gotta be careful here... PR areas and banking,                  and, you know, all sorts of things where they are doing things                  new and differently and applying their skills. </p>                <p class="style7">And they're not just in the United Sates. Because there's                  a lot of things going on in other countries that are making                  a difference in terms of, you know, the awakened group down                  there.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well let me ask you this. Are you, yourself, going                  through any kind of change? Any kind of&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Dilemmas! [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; ...dilemmas as a result of what&rsquo;s been going                  on? Because we talked to you a year ago, and I can <em>look</em> at                  you and see that you've gone through some changes.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; [laughs] I'm gettin' older! [continues laughing]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; No! I mean, at least appearance-wise, it looks very                  positive. I'm curious. And I'm sure that people would like                  to know: How are you affected by this change?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; On a personal level&hellip; I'll be happy to share.                  My diet has changed significantly in terms of what I am able                  to digest and able to eat. Sleep patterns have changed. My                  strength and stamina has changed. It&rsquo;s almost as if it                  was time to get ready,get yourself back in shape again. </p>                <p class="style7">So, there's been changes on multiple tracks in terms of consciousness,                  my consciousness, my energy levels, the work that I'm doing.                  And it&rsquo;s just a microcosm of what's going on with everybody                  that I know. Even people who aren't on the enlightenment path                  are facing massive changes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So that brings us into something that we haven't                  talked about, and that&rsquo;s what's going on in terms of                  cosmic radiation, energy forces affecting the Earth. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly. </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; We are definitely receiving different streams. And                  it's been detailed that this was gonna happen at this point                  in time, and it's making people respond differently.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. So we're going into the center, the Galactic                  Center. As we move towards that, we've got waves of energy                  coming towards us and... Can you talk about that?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Yeah. I think it's a good thing to talk about because                  it's interesting, how you're going to talk about it with two                  different groups. When I talk to a group that&rsquo;s on what                  I call the enlightenment path, the initiate path, we can go                  right into it and talk about it like that. [snaps fingers]</p>                <p class="style7">I got news for you -- we're all here for the swing vote. And                  so, our job right now is not as much to work within our own                  group, but to get those people that are curious and want to                  know more and willing to look through the door at this greater                  reality of what's out there, and start asking questions, and                  live life differently. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And so, when we talk about things&hellip; like we                  talk about radiation, cosmic influences affecting the Earth, &ldquo;we&rdquo; can                  speak about it one way, but it&rsquo;s gonna sound so far-out                  to this other group, they're gonna close their ears and be                  turned off. </p>                <p class="style7">So when we're talking amongst ourselves we can address it                  a certain way, but if we're talking to a group where we want                  to open up to other people, now we start thinking about: <em>OK,                  make it in terms that they can understand. </em></p>                <p class="style7">The reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up is I want the audience                  to understand that these are things that they need to be doing,                  because so many people have good information, but they can't                  get it past their own small group. And we have to start spreading                  out more. </p>                <p class="style7">So that's what the information has been given to me, is to&hellip; We                  have to understand how to be powerful and effective communicators.                  So when we talk about these radiation influences and things                  impacting the planet, we've got to remind people that it's                  not just <em>Woo-hoo</em>, you know, <em>out there</em>. It                  really does happen. </p>                <p class="style7">We can get skin cancer from an orb that is billions of miles                  away. There are radiation belts that surround the Earth. So,                  what makes it so far out to <em>consider</em> that there are                  different radiation and cosmic influences impacting the planet,                  and impacting us as a human species who's on it right now?</p>                <p class="style7">So, what we're finding is that, as you alluded to, that people                  are finding life very different. They're feeling different.                  They're having issues in terms of tiredness. They're having                  issues in terms of energy. They're having dietary issues --                  almost as if they feel like they're being transmuted in some                  way. </p>                <p class="style7">But we have to really watch in how we explain that and talk                  about that so that it does make sense to other people, because                  then they'll just say: <em>Oh, you're a woman. You're going                  through a certain stage of life.</em> Or: <em>Oh, you're a                  man. You're just tired. You're wearing out. It's aging. Etcetera.</em> It                  isn't necessarily aging, is it? </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely not.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; We think something's going on. We think we're changing                  at a cellular level.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly. The DNA is changing.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Well, wait a minute. Let me interrupt you.&nbsp; We                  don't know that. That is a New Age assumption. Because I have                  not seen one study of research that's shown any mutational                  impact whatsoever. But is anybody really looking at it on a                  mass basis? </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. Exactly. </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; We don't know. So I'm also really hesitant, because                  I do have this whole background, this whole medical background,                  of walking both worlds. Is it possible that our DNA's changing?                  Yes. And I've expected it in our lifetime. But nobody's tracking                  it. There's no scientific evidence of it. </p>                <p class="style7">And the whole mythology of this 12-strand DNA is not necessarily                  applicable to the Earth human. </p>                <p class="style7">The power of the genetics lies within the codons and                  the codon sequences and the radiation frequency                  that comes out within each elial. An elial is a mixture of                  the chemical bases that make up your DNA.&nbsp; And so, that's                  where the power lies within, and that's where I believe the                  changes are. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the natural ways of mutation... one of the four natural                  ways&hellip; is radiation. That's how we get spontaneous genetic                  mutation.</p>                <p class="style7">So, I do believe, and I know that you've read my writings,                  that that is what's happening now, as I've been told was going                  to happen. What we need is&hellip; we DO need somebody tracking                  the human on this planet and seeing are there evolutionary                  processes going on? But there's no money, there's no research,                  there's no foundation doing that. </p>                <p class="style7">At the same time, we do have to be careful when we make these                  assumptions as we're changing. I think it's important to say: <em>I                  believe, I think we're changing, but until I see the actual                  genetic evidence of somebody doing a study showing mutational                  changes, then I'm going to look at it a little differently.</em> On                  my own personal belief system? Yeah. We're changing. I do believe                  we are.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Well, you can also see it in your own life.                  I mean, I have to say, here we are a year later. Bob [Dean]                  is looking healthier than he was a year ago. I don't know&hellip; He's                  got a new lease on life. He's going out. He's going to be speaking.                  We thought last year was his last interview. </p>                <p class="style7">I see changes. I see physical changes in the people around                  me. I just can't ignore it, and I think that they are feeling                  the changes. So these are real. I see it. In my own body I                  see it. I mean, it's phenomenal.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; They're changing physically. They're changing emotionally.                  You'll also see a lot of relationships -- I've seen more marriages                  and relationships on the rocks and breaking up than I've <em>ever</em> seen                  in my entire lifetime. You see it emotionally. </p>                <p class="style7">And I've also seen a LOT -- a lot -- of people have life and                  death situations, where a lot of people were all of a sudden&hellip; they                  were tremendously healthy, and they're facing cancer, and they're                  walking through that whole cancer process. And many of them,                  thank God, are coming through it and clearing it through their                  own processes, which I think is very empowering.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; So there's a lot going on.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yeah. So we've gone from the waves of energy coming                  at the Earth, and we've talked about it in a little more practical                  terms. You're fairly sophisticated scientifically, so you've                  also addressed that slightly. </p>                <p class="style7">But what are we doing, as a planet, in your estimation? Can                  you describe the astronomy to people, such that they will understand?                  Both gamuts -- in other words, the people that are watching                  this that are new to the whole notion, and the people that                  are sort of old hands but they have maybe not skewed it in                  their own minds in the way that you might. Do you know what                  I'm saying?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Stop me if I'm not going in the direction that I                  think you want me to go in here. But when you talk about the                  astrology, one of the impacts that&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Astronomy. Not astrology. But astrology would be                  very interesting as well.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Actually, they both come in, because&hellip; Well,                  let me talk about astrology for a second. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; From what I understand, we've had major changes                  astrologically, with some aspects that haven't been around                  for a couple of hundred years, that tend to color and influence                  generations of people that grow up under it. </p>                <p class="style7">Astrology, I think, has an absolute foundation to it. I don't                  think we necessarily read: <em>Oh, this is a me. I'm a Gemini                  today and I should do what the newspaper says. </em>But as                  a more complex process, it's been around for thousands of year.                  And I think there's some foundation to it. </p>                <p class="style7">Plus, with the extraterrestrial teachings that I've had, they've                  gotten into it somewhat, saying that&hellip; At one time, if                  I remember correctly, they were telling me how... the way that                  the Moon impacts the ocean and has that influence on the tides,                  that the actual planetary influences have an impact on our                  cellular components within ourselves. </p>                <p class="style7">I don't remember. I'd have to go look it up and read what                  I had as notes. But I remember that they were pointing me to,                  that there really was a foundation to astrological influences                  on the human being.</p>                <p class="style7">So, there's those major changes that are coming in that affect                  generations that could be an impetus for this. </p>                <p class="style7">As far as astronomy, we have what's called the end of the                  Kali Yuga. We're coming to the end of a major cycle. And we                  do tend to forget that we&rsquo;re on a planet hurtling through                  space, that is moving. </p>                <p class="style7">We just tend to look out the window and see our car parked                  out there and traffic going by, or look at the four walls and                  see our immediate surroundings. But we're on a <em>space vehicle</em>.                  And we're moving, as if we were a boat in the ocean. </p>                <p class="style7">We're moving through space. And as a result of that, we are                  going through different areas, different zones that have different                  influences, just like, if we were on that ocean, and we were                  suddenly coming to a region that was characterized by great                  storm activity. And then we would get through it and go on                  to a region that may have calmer waters. </p>                <p class="style7">That's pretty much where we're at right now. And I think we're                  all feeling that effect. And, you know, it's a little bit of                  chaos. But I think chaos can be a good thing, because otherwise,                  you&rsquo;d just stay where you're at. And where we have been                  has not necessarily been that great in the past.</p>                <p class="style7">We have tremendous advantages that we haven't had, but at                  the same time, we're not paying attention to the full picture.                  And we have to respect the entire cycle of life on this planet,                  and really pay attention to the extinction of species that                  is going on, the environmental decimation that's taking place. </p>                <p class="style7">And the human being has to really get its act together if                  they want to continue to be the leading harbinger on this planet                  of the species kingdom.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. So, what do you think the chances are that we're                  gonna avoid nuclear war in the near future?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I honestly don't know. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; I honestly don't know. I would like to think they're                  very good, [laughs] but I honestly don't know.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. And what about the United States, the political                  system? Do you have high hopes for us in the future here?</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; [pantomimes herself] <em>She scratches her head. </em>[laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s very easy to be negative about it. What we're seeing,                  though, is we don't have the patience any more for the two-party                  system. It doesn't work. I mean, we've had the Tories and the                  Whigs. You know, we've had two parties, either/or, polarization,                  you know, left or right, black or white. </p>                <p class="style7">I think we've grown beyond the two-party system. I'd like                  to have just one party, if it worked! [Kerry laughs]. You know,                  if they could get something done. </p>                <p class="style7">I think the&hellip; especially in the United States, the start                  of America, the Founding Fathers, the American Revolution&hellip; it                  was brilliant! I have the greatest respect for that time. But                  what it has descended into is, really, this huge bureaucracy                  that just doesn't work. </p>                <p class="style7">I've worked in the private sector, and I've spent many years                  in government, so I know what goes on. And it&rsquo;s just&hellip; Big                  corporations, too; they're just strangled by bureaucracy. When                  you're in crisis, you don't have time for that.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; But the problem's not bureaucracy. The problem is                  that it's been taken over like a Punch and Judy show. And it's                  not a real democracy anyway because... </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; No. It hasn't been for a long time.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; ... the same group controls both sides. So actually,                  it&rsquo;s a farce. I mean, this isn't a real election anyway.                  It&rsquo;s not a question of polarization. It&rsquo;s a question                  of dialectic, isn't it? That they use these &ldquo;apparent                  opposites&rdquo; to keep people busy in television debates,                  where actually the whole thing is engineered.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; Our whole life is engineered. I mean, the human                  history is SO different than it&rsquo;s has been given to us.                  And so, what has been happening is &ndash; always -- you keep                  the human distracted, and you can do whatever you want. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; And so that's why we need to get the human to understand                  what really goes on in this planet, who they really are, so                  they can take the power back within themselves and stop behaving                  like the herd species, the slave-race mentality, always accepting                  mediocrity, and not doing what's right. </p>                <p class="style7">We kill off our best and our brightest all the time! I mean,                  if you look through our history. Anyone that stands on the                  fringe, and anybody who's been an innovative leader, has usually                  ended up in the stocks, on the chopping block, or is wasting                  away in prison, tortured. </p>                <p class="style7">We don't revere our great ones. WE KILL 'EM OFF! The human                  species loves mediocrity. It&rsquo;s time for that to change,                  I think. I prefer to stay optimistic.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; All right. Well, thank you, Marcia. </p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; You&rsquo;re welcome. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; This has been a lot of fun and actually quite enlightening.                  I think that people will find it very valuable.</p>                <p class="style7">MS:&nbsp; It's been a delight talking to you again.
