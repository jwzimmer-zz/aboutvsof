I&rsquo;m Kerry Cassidy from Project                  Camelot, and we&rsquo;re here with Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Leary.                  He&rsquo;s a lecturer, scientist, ex-astronaut, and we&rsquo;re                  very pleased to be with him today. And we&rsquo;re here in                  beautiful Ecuador at Montesuenos, which is your retreat, I                  think you want to call it. What we want to do is kind of get                  into your background. <font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="brian_o_leary_med.jpg" width="500" height="355" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right"></font></p>                <p class="style7">Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Leary (BO&rsquo;L):&nbsp; Yes. I&rsquo;m                  afraid that at my ripe old age of 69 that my background has                  been pretty eclectic and it&rsquo;s kind of hard to pin me                  down, like, you know: <em>Who is this guy?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">But it all started back when I was a little kid and I wanted                  to go into space. I wanted to go to the Moon. I wanted to go                  to Mars, and there was no space program then. And then, somewhat                  ironically, I got involved in the Apollo Program, twelve years                  after I wanted to go into space and nobody thought there would                  ever be a space program. </p>                <p class="style7">This was back in the late &rsquo;40s, early &rsquo;50s. But                  when Sputnik went up, then the whole world changed. And it                  was also around then that there was more awareness of the UFO                  phenomenon, paranormal phenomena. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, what happened with me was that I went on one track,                  which was a very ambitious career which was actually quite                  fulfilled, because I became an astronaut after getting my PhD                  in astronomy at Berkeley. </p>                <p class="style7">And then I got involved in planetary exploration, some of                  the Mariner programs. I taught with Carl Sagan at Cornell University                  and did research on planetary science. </p>                <p class="style7">Then I went to Washington, became an advisor to various political                  leaders, various presidential candidates.</p>                <p class="style7">I was kind of like an &ldquo;academic drifter&rdquo; in many                  ways. Even though on paper I was successful, I would be kind                  of hopping from university to university, and this, I think,                  helped prepare the way for the later half of my life, which                  was really quite different from the first half. </p>                <p class="style7">The first half was more traditional, more being a physicist                  who was very familiar with, for example, energy and environment                  issues, having advised Congress and having taught courses on                  it. </p>                <p class="style7">I was also aware of atmospheric science and some of the things                  that were ahead for the Earth which are now very familiar,                  such as global warming, global climate change, and a number                  of other human-related catastrophes that are happening on the                  Earth now.</p>                <p class="style7">So, in a sense, my own straight academic background was a                  good one, good preparation for studying energy policy: <em>What                  kind of choices do we really have in the energy crisis?</em> But                  also: <em>To what degree are humans interfering with the Earth?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And so, the second half of my life, if you will: After I was                  in the physics department at Princeton in 1979, I started to                  have some unusual experiences -- remote viewing experiences,                  a near-death experience, various healing experiences then that                  opened <em>Pandora&rsquo;s Box</em> up. </p>                <p class="style7">I was at that time in the physics department at Princeton.                  My colleagues, many of them Nobel<em> Laureates</em>, all men,                  thought I was crazy to embrace paranormal phenomena. </p>                <p class="style7">Then later I got into the UFO phenomena. I led a number of                  scientific groups to get together to try to disclose the research                  that was going on. </p>                <p class="style7">And it was around that time I began to get in touch with all                  the &ldquo;Black Projects&rdquo;, not from the inside, but                  from the outside, kind of peering in and seeing what was happening,                  that there&rsquo;s been this massive cover-up.</p>                <p class="style7">Well, one thing led to another. I spent a number of years                  after I left Princeton -- and now we&rsquo;re getting into                  the &rsquo;80s -- of exploring various things like the &ldquo;Face&rdquo;on                  Mars, NASA&rsquo;s cover-up of that, and looking further at                  the UFO phenomena. </p>                <p class="style7">I published a number of books, a trilogy, basically, in which                  I kind of review the state of the art of &ldquo;new science&rdquo;,                  or science-outside-the-box-of-western-thinking. </p>                <p class="style7">So we have, for example&hellip; In this book [<em>Exploring                    Inner and Outer Space</em>] I talk about the state of the                    art of UFO research, but I also talk about consciousness,                    the mind-over-matter interaction, the fact that exploring                    outer space and exploring inner space can lead to all sorts                    of new paradigms of reality. </p>                <p class="style7">Then, in <em>The Second Coming of Science</em>, this book                  here, I did some very careful studies that replicated the work                  of many pioneers of new science -- people such as Marcel Vogel.                  I would go and visit various miracle-makers, like Sai Baba,                  and saw him materialize things. I went all over the world.                  I went to Brazil to visit Thomaz Green Morton, a very gifted                  psychic. </p>                <p class="style7">Then I began to get more interested in the environment. At                  that point I published <em>Miracle in the Void,</em> which                  was a photo-journalistic look at some of the best and brightest                  free energy researchers all over the world -- India, Japan,                  and so forth. </p>                <p class="style7">I began to realize that we <em>could</em> solve our energy                  problem really quite quickly if we only embrace these technologies.                  However, they&rsquo;ve been suppressed, and sometimes violently                  suppressed. </p>                <p class="style7">So in this book, <em>Miracle in the Void</em>, which was really                  a collaboration with my wife Meredith, an artist&hellip; she                  was painting her masterpiece, <em>The Last Supper of Gaia,</em> while                  I was writing this book&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">And what I discovered was that paradigm shifts are more a                  social / political phenomenon than a technological question,                  that it goes way beyond the drama of outside researchers coming                  up with breakthroughs which then are suppressed. </p>                <p class="style7">It has to do with creating whole new structures                  which are unsupported by the larger culture. </p>                <p class="style7">In fact, what&rsquo;s happening now on the planet is that                  we are grieving the loss of Mother Earth. And even though this                  is a subconscious thing, what happens is that, according to                  the work of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, we go through various phases                  of grieving -- grieving the loss of our mother planet. </p>                <p class="style7">So Meredith and I became avid environmentalists. What I attempted                  to do then -- and now we&rsquo;re talking the middle 1990s                  -- was to examine what psychological effects come through each                  of us as we begin to embrace the new paradigm. </p>                <p class="style7">Meredith and I collaborated on this project. What we were                  able to identify -- and this is based on the work of Elisabeth                  Kubler-Ross, <em>On Death and Dying</em> -- is that we&rsquo;ve                  all grieving the loss of Mother Earth. By <em>all</em> I mean                  those of us that are sensitive and aware of the problems that                  are unfolding on the planet.</p>                <p class="style7">What Meredith and I figured out was that many of us are in                  denial -- most of us -- about the severity of the problems,                  such as global climate change, such as the possibility of nuclear                  war, the war in Iraq, and so forth and so on&hellip; that these                  things fly in the face of what we <em>really</em> need to be                  doing, which is developing clean energy, making sure we have                  clean water, having an international system of justice, depending                  more and more on local resources, local rule, and&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">But anyway, most people are in denial about <em>everything</em>,                  including the UFO phenomenon and free energy, which are two                  of my favorite topics, both of which I&rsquo;ve found, for                  myself, are very free.</p>                <p class="style7">So then we go from denial on to anger: <em>The truth&rsquo;ll                    set you free, but first it will piss you off.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Then we go into bargaining: <em>How can we fit the new within                    the context of the old?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">A lot of people were stimulated by Barack Obama&rsquo;s comments                  about how we need <em>change</em>. Well, the kind of change                  that would be implemented there is what I call <em>incremental</em> change,                  tiny little things. </p>                <p class="style7">And then, meanwhile, the progressives that are trying to nip                  on his heels are saying: <em>Well, we need </em>structural<em> change.                  We need to go back to the Constitution. We need to have a kind                  of Rooseveltian New Deal and Keynesian economy. We need something                  that is like going back to a point of reference, like the Roosevelt                  or Clinton administration.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And that&rsquo;s not going to work. So when none of these                  things work, then, according to the work of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,                  then we go into depression. </p>                <p class="style7">A lot of people are depressed. I&rsquo;ve noticed this. A                  lot of people, especially in the US, they&rsquo;re just not                  very happy with what&rsquo;s going on. That happens also when                  people lose their loved ones. They get depressed after denial,                  anger, and bargaining, and then, finally people get into acceptance.</p>                <p class="style7">The point here is that the Earth is getting ruined by human                  intervention. I mean, it&rsquo;s so obvious. </p>                <p class="style7">And we need to seek the truth. So, part of what I did was                  publish a book called <em>Re-Inheriting the Earth,</em> which                  was awakening to sustainable solutions, and many of them lie                  far outside the box of conventional thinking. </p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so interested in the free energy                  question, very interested in some of the questions of ways                  of purifying water in ways that have not been acknowledged                  before. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m very interested in the phenomena of consciousness,                  how Combined Positive Human Intention can really and truly                  change the material world. These are ideas, now, that are proven                  by quantum physics, and paranormal phenomena. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, this whole array of solutions -- in principle -- could                  work, if only we can change the <em>system</em>. Only if we                  could change our governance, our public awareness, and education. </p>                <p class="style7">So, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been all about in the last                  few years. My most recent book is called <em>The Energy Solution                  Revolution,</em> which is based on my 20 years of experience                  at examining the proofs-of-concept of free energy devices.                  By <em>free energy</em> I mean&hellip; <em>Free energy</em> is                  sometimes a funny word. Maybe we could use the word <em>solution                  energy</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">These represent quantum-leap breakthroughs from what we now                  know. It&rsquo;s going way beyond solar and wind in term of                  cleanliness. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s actually&hellip; It&rsquo;s sort of analogous to &ldquo;The                  Information Age.&rdquo; Who would have ever imagined that computers                  and internet would have existed, even 20 years ago? It was                  only a small number of people who foresaw that. </p>                <p class="style7">What I foresee, along with many colleagues who&rsquo;ve been                  suppressed, is that we can have a free energy, or a solution                  energy, culture in the world. </p>                <p class="style7">By <em>solution energy</em> I mean vacuum energy -- energy                  from the vacuum of space -- which is well known to the yogis,                  that <em>everywhere</em> has enormous amounts of potential                  energy, if we can only tap into it. And there are ways of tapping                  into it. </p>                <p class="style7">So, some of my world travels, and the work of my colleagues,                  and various professional organizations, has <em>proven</em> beyond                  any reasonable doubt that these forms of energy are unprecedented.                  They do exist. The Wright brothers have already flown on this                  one. We&rsquo;re just not making practical use. </p>                <p class="style7">The reason why we&rsquo;re not making practical use of these                  energy sources is because they are suppressed. <em>Actively</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">The people that work on these things are threatened, assassinated.                  And manipulated. Bought off. When somebody gets near realization,                  that&rsquo;s when the big boys go in, and this has happened                  again and again and again.</p>                <p class="style7">So, that&rsquo;s a very important part of the awareness training                  of the general public. It&rsquo;s also part of the very important                  work that <em>Project Camelot</em> is doing, which is to interview                  many people formerly on the inside, maybe still on the inside. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;ve never been on the inside, but I sure know how the                  inside works, and what their agenda is, and their motivations,                  which flies in the face of development, potential development,                  of free energy. </p>                <p class="style7">And we all know also, and many people don&rsquo;t quite understand                  it is: <em>Well, if it&rsquo;s real, then we&rsquo;d have it                  by now&hellip; just go down to K-Mart and get my little solid-state                  power-pack.</em> <em>And we can go off the grid system. Everything                  is clean. Everybody&rsquo;s happy. </em> </p>                <p class="style7">But it doesn&rsquo;t quite work out that way. It takes money                  and time to develop it. So we need an Apollo Program for new                  energy -- <em>new energy</em> meaning vacuum energy, cold fusion,                  advanced hydrogen and water technologies. </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s quite a long list of technologies, any one of                  which would do it. But it&rsquo;s going to take effort to develop                  these energy sources. </p>                <p class="style7">So, in <em>The Energy Solution Revolution,</em> I address                  less the technical issues, because the internet and the general                  literature&rsquo;s just full of information on the technologies                  themselves. But instead, I&rsquo;ve looked at the political                  and social questions, and the educational questions. </p>                <p class="style7">You know: <em>Why is it that otherwise intelligent people                    would not embrace this possibility, if it&rsquo;s going to solve                    the energy problem?</em> And, of course, people don&rsquo;t                    do it for a number of reasons. There&rsquo;ve been a number                    of studies done. It&rsquo;s really a social science question                    as to why there&rsquo;s such resistance to this change.</p>                <p class="style7">Bertrand Russell one time said: <em>The resistance to a new                    idea increases as the square of its importance.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">If we&rsquo;re talking about supplanting a four-billion-dollar                  energy industry, highly polluting, with a clean energy that&rsquo;s                  cheap and decentralized, then we&rsquo;re talking about a paradigm                  shift, and The Powers That Be don&rsquo;t want that to happen.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Brian, that&rsquo;s a wonderful summary of everything                  you&rsquo;ve been involved in over the past few years. What                  I&rsquo;d like to do is actually go back in time and get something                  about, kind of, the things that triggered you to become the                  man you are today. </p>                <p class="style7">Because clearly you&rsquo;ve had a huge sort of arc, learning                  curve, whatever you want to call it, in which you&rsquo;ve                  really traversed quite a gamut of things and concepts. And                  actually, as a scientist, you&rsquo;ve moved quite a distance                  from being sort of a hands-on scientist, I guess, that is conventionally                  thought of as a scientist.</p>                <p class="style7">You&rsquo;ve actually become something of an innovative thinker,                  and even maybe, loosely, a philosopher. But you&rsquo;ve never                  lost sight of the science. So, at this point you&rsquo;re really                  an interesting combination of these things. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, what I&rsquo;d like to do is talk about your background                  as an astronaut. You were preparing to go to Mars, I understand.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And yet you never went. If you could tell me a little                  bit about what was going in your head back then, when you were&hellip; what                  do you say&hellip; in the astronaut program. Where were you                  at, you know, psychologically? So that we can kind of get the                  arc of the change. Because I think that would be fascinating                  for people.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes, Kerry. Yes. That&rsquo;s a good question,                  and a complex one. But I think from a very early age I always&hellip; I&rsquo;ve                  always been a visionary; I&rsquo;ve thought outside the box.                  When I was a little kid I was drawing rockets and wanted to                  go to the Moon. Even my high school yearbook says under my                  name: <em>He wants to go to the Moon. </em>And people were                  laughing. [Kerry laughs] This was before Sputnik! </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Wonderful.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Everybody thought I was crazy. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Then I majored in physics. I didn&rsquo;t                  enjoy it. It was kind of dry, but I realized that I&rsquo;d                  better know some of that stuff if I wanted to go to the Moon.                  And then, as luck would have it, of course, John F. Kennedy                  in 1961 set the lunar landing goal, and I got very enthused.                  I was in graduate school at the time. </p>                <p class="style7">A few years later I got my PhD at Berkeley in astronomy and                  planetary science. So I had really prepped myself to go to                  Mars because my PhD thesis was about Mars. </p>                <p class="style7">And indeed, I was selected to go to Mars. I was even asked                  by the selection committee in my interview: <em>Would you be                  willing to submit to a hazardous two-year journey to Mars?</em> And                  I said: <em>Fine. I don&rsquo;t know whether my wife would                  like it, but I want to go.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">I was gung ho. I had a crew cut. It was very different from                  the way things are for me now. It was later I became a hippy,                  sort of, you know&hellip; an alternative thinker, shall we                  say? </p>                <p class="style7">But I think all of this was inbred in me. I&rsquo;d always                  had problems with authority. I always had problems with rules.                  That&rsquo;s one reason why I&rsquo;d go from university to                  university. I was recognized more for mediocrity and doing                  research on tiny little specialties. I was well rewarded when                  that happened. </p>                <p class="style7">But when I had some visionary idea, such as space colonies,                  or mining the asteroids for their raw materials, people would                  scratch their heads and say: <em>Well, this guy isn&rsquo;t                  quite with it.</em> [Kerry laughs] One colleague said:<em> Brian,                  don&rsquo;t have such an open mind that your brains will spill                  out. </em>And it was only later, though, that&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">You see, I was still in the materialistic paradigm. I was                  still assuming that anything and everything could be explained                  in terms of <em>matter</em>, and in terms of reductionism,                  and everything made up of little atoms.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. The normal scientific paradigm.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So what happened to take you from the astronaut                  program to actually being a professor? I understand you were                  tapped, but you also sort of left the astronaut program. So                  how did that happen?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, I left the astronaut program because                  they cancelled the Mars program, and I felt that&hellip; And                  we knew that the Space Shuttle was coming along, but the wait                  for that would have to be at least 15 years. </p>                <p class="style7">We also had to fly high-performance jets. I calculated that                  I&rsquo;d have a one-in-five chance of being killed in a jet                  accident -- which is both Air Force and astronaut statistics                  -- even before I got to see a space flight, and it would just                  be into Earth orbit in the Space Shuttle. So I decided right                  then and there to quit, and&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">But there was an additional reason, and that is that the reason                  why NASA had canceled the Mars mission was because we were                  getting involved in Vietnam. So I really got pretty angry about                  the Vietnam War, for me personally as well as for the whole                  country, the whole world, and so I became a leading war protestor. </p>                <p class="style7">Carl Sagan called me from Cornell and asked me to join the                  faculty. I accepted the offer and spent many years at Cornell                  in the astronomy department, planetary science department.                  And I became very creative in research then, but still within                  the bounds of western science, but in the planetary exploration                  program. That was for a period of about a decade. </p>                <p class="style7">Then, after that, I got more politically involved and I advised                  a number of presidential candidates -- George McGovern, Morris                  Udall. I worked for Udall. I was his energy advisor when he                  ran for president. He was a very environmental congressman. </p>                <p class="style7">I advised Jesse Jackson on converting the huge aerospace capability                  we have to peaceful purposes, like developing solution energy                  and other programs that would be of use to the public and not                  to just this hungry elite. </p>                <p class="style7">It was around then that I really became rebellious. I went                  from university to university and I never was satisfied.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But isn&rsquo;t there a time in which you and Carl                  Sagan sort of had a falling-out, or a distancing? Can you describe                  what happened there?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. Well, for one thing, Carl was very                  angry I left Cornell when I did. It was&hellip; One very cold                  snowy day in May, I landed in Syracuse, and there was a horizontal                  blizzard -- in May -- and I said: <em>That&rsquo;s it for upstate                  New York</em>. And Carl thought that was very frivolous. Because,                  of course, he was kind of an empire-builder kind of guy; and                  he also had a huge ego. </p>                <p class="style7">It was only later, when I began to embrace the UFO phenomenon                  and the cover-up, studying all these organizations that were                  covering up, and having some direct experience, myself, as                  a researcher no longer beholden to funding from NASA or the                  university environment, that I began to double-check some of                  Carl&rsquo;s work. </p>                <p class="style7">I saw, for example, the famous &ldquo;Face&rdquo; in Cydonia                  on Mars, photographed by Viking in 1975, which shows this gigantic                  mesa that resembles a human face, about a mile across. Carl                  and I debated this. </p>                <p class="style7">It was very, very disappointing to me, because not only was                  Carl wrong, he also fudged data. He published a picture of                  the &ldquo;Face&rdquo; in <em>Parade Magazine</em>, a popular                  article, saying that the &ldquo;Face&rdquo; was just a natural                  formation, but he doctored the picture to make it not look                  like a face. </p>                <p class="style7">I began to realize, just directly from the scientific point                  of view, not only hearsay, that this man was colluding with                  NASA, that there might be more to this than before. And then,                  when I started studying things like MJ12 and other organizations                  that were covering up the UFO phenomenon&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">Carl was on a committee with a number of notable people. There                  was a report issued by the Brookings Institution in 1961 --                  and that&rsquo;s about when I knew Carl, during those years;                  the &rsquo;60s mostly was when I worked closely with him --                  that he and this other group said: <em>Well, if any ETs ever                  showed up on the Earth, it has to be covered up. That&rsquo;s                  the only way we&rsquo;re going to be able to manage this, because                  if we can&rsquo;t, then it would be too much of a culture shock.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So their recommendation to the government in 1961 was to cover                  up the UFO phenomenon, and I think in a way that provided a                  justification for the ongoing cover-up way back in &rsquo;61                  -- was to keep things secret. And of course they still are.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So, at what point were you&hellip; Where did Hoagland                  come into this mix? Because once you were talking about the &ldquo;Face&rdquo; on                  Mars, I have to assume that you had some interaction with Hoagland.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. He&hellip; Actually, he&rsquo;s a great                  catalyst. He&rsquo;s very articulate. He&rsquo;s very bright.                  He had some very good ideas. He came to me in about&hellip; I                  think it was around 1980. It was a few years after the Viking                  mission, and I was still involved with the mainstream then. </p>                <p class="style7">So Dick Hoagland wanted me -- still being a somewhat mainstream                  planetary scientist -- to listen to him, listen to his presentation                  about the Cydonia &ldquo;Face,&rdquo; and he made a presentation                  which I thought was very good. </p>                <p class="style7">He asked me to check his work. I thought a great deal of the                  work was extremely well done and which I vindicated enough                  to say that, <em>Yes. I, too, would like to get into this                  research</em>, and then the research started to snowball. So                  that was the good news. </p>                <p class="style7">The not-so-good news is that he also made a lot of claims                  that were certainly not correct. They were scientifically not                  well grounded. He was arbitrary in picking some of the points                  in the region as control points for various geometric alignments,                  which were simply not true. So I also had somewhat of a falling-out                  with him because&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">You see, most scientists, people trained in science, as a                  scientist&hellip; In a way I still defend mainstream science                  in terms of methodology, that you have to have your work subject                  to peer review in order to get it published. And I think that&rsquo;s                  very good. You know, it&rsquo;s really good to preserve the                  scientific method. </p>                <p class="style7">So I found myself in this odd middle ground between people                  that were outside the system making claims, such as Dick Hoagland                  did, some of which are very, very substantial and good, on                  the one hand; and on the other hand, using strict scientific                  methods to approach these questions. </p>                <p class="style7">Eventually some colleagues joined me and a number of us now                  have worked together, such as Dr. Mark Carlotto, an imaging                  scientist; Professor Stan McDaniel, Chairman of the Philosophy                  Department at Sonoma State; Doctor Horace Crater, Professor                  of Physics, University of Tennessee; the late Dr. Tom Van Flandern. </p>                <p class="style7">These are all mainstream scientists, trained in the mainstream                  just like I was, and also open to the questions, such as the &ldquo;Face&rdquo; on                  Mars. </p>                <p class="style7">So, in a way, it was kind of a roundabout way, because now                  that I was out of the mainstream&hellip; Because all I have                  to do is stick my neck out a little to be totally ostracized                  by the mainstream scientific community and that happened around                  1980.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Was that when you were at Princeton?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. So what&hellip; because I know there are some                  parallels between you and the late John Mack. I know you knew                  him, and how he was treated by Harvard. And so, can you talk                  a little bit about what happened to you at Princeton?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, yes. Actually, I think I left before                  they threw me out [Kerry laughs] because I saw the handwriting                  on the wall. I was in the physics department. All men. Nobel <em>Laureates</em>,                  about five or six Nobel <em>Laureates</em>. And every other                  Tuesday at the Joseph Henry Luncheons, we would swill a thimbleful                  of sherry, and the most common topic of discussion was how                  ridiculous claims of the paranormal were.</p>                <p class="style7">Meanwhile, I was sneaking off to workshops on the weekends.                  I did a <em>Lifespring</em> training. I did a number of other                  healing seminars, and so forth. I started to step outside of                  the box and I found that they were very wrong. But my colleagues                  were also&hellip; they had more power than I did at that time.                  So I felt the most prudent thing to do was to simply leave,                  and that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But how did their antagonism towards you manifest                  in that setting?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; [laughs] Well, for one thing, when I left,                  there were no regrets because the word got around that I was                  going off half-cocked here, in embracing paranormal phenomena. </p>                <p class="style7">They were looking askance anyway because at that time I was                  working with Professor Gerard O&rsquo;Neill on space colonies,                  and even those concepts were a bit far-out for the other physicists                  there. So it was like a double whammy. And so, in my case,                  I left before they could have caused problems. Whereas John                  Mack&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And where did you go? When you say you left, where                  were you headed? Did you know where you were headed, or were                  you just leaving?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; No. I just left. I just left.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Oh. Fascinating. Because that&rsquo;s huge. Wouldn&rsquo;t                  you say that that&rsquo;s your major break with academia? </p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; From then on you kind of took a trajectory that                  actually went like that, in a sense?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. Yes. I did&hellip; In the interim I                  had a near-death experience in an auto accident which prompted                  me to go to California. <em>Go west, young man</em>. [laughs]                  So I took all my worldly possessions and bought a beat-up old                  Ford van and threw it in there and drove to California in 1982. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Wow.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; This was just after a near-death experience                  I had in an auto accident, which was yet another paranormal                  indicator that where I was and what I was doing was not working                  for me. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; When you say you had a near-death experience&hellip; You                  know, I&rsquo;m not sure how you feel about that, but is it                  possible to convey to us what connected that experience with                  the paranormal? Did you actually&hellip;meaning, did you die                  and see certain things?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; My near-death experience was during an auto                  accident on slick ice that suddenly appeared and fortunately                  I was by myself. I did several flips. I was going 65 mph. I                  ended up in a ditch, accordion-style. </p>                <p class="style7">But my experience of the accident was not of the violence,                  but instead, a brilliant light -- first of all, bobbing spheres,                  and then a brilliant light that I wanted to become at-one with.                  I did become at-one with it. </p>                <p class="style7">Then, the next thing I knew, I was sitting in the driver&rsquo;s                  seat, dazed, shocked, and a man was at the window of the car.                  He was a professional auto insurance adjustor who had witnessed                  the accident, and he said: <em>I&rsquo;m amazed you&rsquo;re                  alive, let alone uninjured.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And that, to me, was a profound experience, because at that                  point I hadn&rsquo;t studied the paranormal very much. I was                  still at Princeton. I was just getting my appetite whetted                  about some of these things, about human potential and about                  my own experiences. I had remote viewing experiences. I had                  the near-death experience. I had healing experiences. </p>                <p class="style7">And that was kind of my signpost to leave Princeton and to                  just go on my own, and that was a risky thing. I ended up in                  California, in LA, looking for a job in the aerospace industry                  so I could get my kids through college. </p>                <p class="style7">But to do civilian work, I did find a position with Science                  Applications which turned out to be a&hellip; You know. It&rsquo;s                  one of the &ldquo;Black Budget Beltway Bandit&rdquo; groups.                  [Kerry laughs] But I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t involved                  in&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Is that SAIC?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; SAIC. Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; They&rsquo;re notorious, actually, for being part                  of the black budget.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. And I had nothing to do with it. I                  refused to do any work for the military, even &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; work,                  like satellites to just sense threats, to defend themselves.                  I was even offered to do that and I refused to do it. </p>                <p class="style7">After four and a half years, just before I got vested in my                  retirement plan, they laid me off, and they had good reason                  to, too. I didn&rsquo;t pull in any money! [Kerry laughs]&nbsp; So                  it was then -- and now we&rsquo;re talking 1987 -- that I made                  a clean break with the mainstream. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; I got my kids halfway through college, and                  then I got on the metaphysical church circuit, Unity and Religious                  Science churches. And that&rsquo;s how I kind of made a living                  for about a decade while I was just metaphysically exploring,                  just going into so many modalities of alternative thinking. </p>                <p class="style7">What I discovered during that decade of the &rsquo;80s into                  the &rsquo;90s, and that&rsquo;s what created my books, was                  that you could use the methods of science itself to verify,                  and to further develop, metaphysical realities.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm. Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s what really fascinated                  me. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; You can actually use the scientific method to investigate                  the occult as well.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right. Absolutely.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great method, regardless of where it&rsquo;s                  applied, in some ways.</p>                <p class="style7">Bill Ryan (BR):&nbsp; While you were are Princeton before                  that, didn&rsquo;t you find a kindred spirit in Robert John?                  His is a name that many viewers of this video will probably                  recognize as being a pioneer, and one of the trail-breaking &ldquo;scientific                  heretics&rdquo; in the field of paranormal exploration with                  the rigorous application of the scientific method. I imagine                  that you probably got along with him pretty well.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. Absolutely, Bill. I got along with                  him very well. But the odd thing about it was that at the time                  when he was starting to do his experiments at the Princeton                  Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory, Paralabs, he was                  doing a lot of the research while I was there, but I didn&rsquo;t                  know what he was doing. </p>                <p class="style7">He didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing, either, because I didn&rsquo;t                  want to share with my colleagues the fact that I was sneaking                  off to workshops on weekends, or that I was having paranormal                  experiences. </p>                <p class="style7">So we were both in the closet at that point. He didn&rsquo;t                  know what I was doing. I didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing,                  although we were colleagues on various mainstream projects,                  such as developing propulsion systems to go to Mars. </p>                <p class="style7">His specialty was various advanced propulsion systems for                  rockets. He was the chairman, well, actually the Dean of the                  School of Engineering at Princeton. I would put on a number                  of conferences with Jerry [Gerard] O&rsquo;Neill on space colonies,                  space settlements, and Bob John took part in those. </p>                <p class="style7">So I knew him pretty well, but not in this role of paranormal                  research. That only happened later, when I visited his laboratory                  and did an interview with him for one of my books, <em>The                  Second Coming of Science,</em> that our whole relationship                  was redefined. </p>                <p class="style7">It was around then that I also developed a relationship with                  John Mack as I was learning more and more about the UFO phenomenon                  and some of the more verifiable aspects of its reality. </p>                <p class="style7">So, in a way, I&rsquo;ve had a ball in my life because I was                  able to be very independent. I didn&rsquo;t have to depend                  on anybody for career purposes. I didn&rsquo;t get paid very                  much. I was, you know, living very simply for a period of 20                  or 30 years&hellip; still do in a sense because, you know,                  we just do things a little differently. </p>                <p class="style7">The point is that for, I would say now almost 30 years, I                  haven&rsquo;t had to be beholden to anybody to approve what                  I&rsquo;m doing. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; But on the other hand, that can create problems,                  too, and it did.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; When Black Ops tried to recruit me once                  and I refused, there were consequences and they were very serious.                  But without sharing exactly what they were, suffice it to say                  that I began to realize that at that time, and I&rsquo;m talking                  20 or so years ago, I was pretty na&iuml;ve. I was wanting                  to do all kinds of things like organize conferences, get researchers                  together to speak in a unified way about various issues. But                  that was not well appreciated by The Powers That Be.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I want to get into that because that&rsquo;s a really                  interesting part of your history. But before we do that, you                  did say you got to know John Mack? I think he was a friend                  of yours&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; &hellip;and I was curious, did he ever, I don&rsquo;t                  know, regress you? Did you have what he would consider a contact                  experience?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Not to my knowledge. I didn&rsquo;t have                  that kind of relationship with him. The relationship was more                  like&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">When I was really heavy into UFO research during the 1990s,                  I was attempting to piece together the best information that                  was scientifically most grounded and also found out: <em>Well,                  what is the contact experience telling us?</em> This led on                  his part and my part to have a profound sense of colleagueship                  and deep concern about the fate of the Earth, the fate of our                  culture, because the environmental problems are so severe.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s because the contactees were coming                  back with this message, basically, kind of almost across the                  board. Is that right?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s correct. His book, <em>Passport                    to the Cosmos,</em> which was his latest book before his                    untimely death, was really an account of that. The most common                    denominator of the contact experience was that the visitors                    were telling us, and doing graphic, emotionally-charged images                    of what the Earth would look like if we keep doing things                    the way we&rsquo;re doing them. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, John came to this issue from the point of view of                  abduction research. I came to it from the point of view of                  just looking at the numbers, at just how the state of the world                  is just miserable, that we&rsquo;ve got not that much longer                  before tipping points will destabilize climate, and all sorts                  of catastrophes. </p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s even setting aside the possibility of nuclear                  war, of bankrupt&hellip; well, everything is getting bankrupt                  now anyway. I mean, it&rsquo;s disaster ahead unless we change                  our ways. </p>                <p class="style7">John kind of saw the light. Robert John at Princeton saw the                  light. And little by little, you see, as scientists, we as                  colleagues came together. But it took a long time -- we&rsquo;ve                  been divided and ruled.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Would you say that in some ways you kind of became                  a figure, or a central person, around which a lot of these                  people could come together? On the one hand, the UFO researchers                  -- I know that you started setting up conferences. You would                  bring them in. But on the other hand you were actually bringing                  scientists to the table, such as John Mack and Robert John.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s correct. I co-founded an organization                  called the International Association for New Science and we                  had annual conferences between about 1989 and 1999. The other                  co-founder, God rest his soul, Maury [Maurice] Albertson, who                  was a professor of civil engineering at Colorado State, he                  and I and one other fellow basically founded it. </p>                <p class="style7">We had conferences, and we&rsquo;d convene people in various                  disciplines in what we would call &ldquo;new science&rdquo;,                  which would include free energy, UFO research, paranormal research,                  reincarnation research. </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;d bring in some of the best scientists in those fields                  and we&rsquo;d create a collegiality and also do a public program                  of lectures that would then pay for the travel of the people.                  We kind of worked on a shoestring budget. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re                  familiar with that one. [Kerry laughs] But there was a lot                  of ambition and motivation. </p>                <p class="style7">Maury just passed over, but at the ripe age of about 90. So                  he&rsquo;s one of my heroes. A lot of my heroes have passed                  over, and some of them more recently than others, so it&rsquo;s                  kind of like a lonely business sometimes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So it was during the time when you were putting                  these conferences together that you actually felt there was                  a hit on you from the secret government, if you will. Is that                  correct? I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure how you would term it.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, yes. [hesitantly] Let&rsquo;s say                  that I&rsquo;ve had a situation that was threatening to me                  and it was as a result of some of my work. And also it&rsquo;s                  happened to many of my colleagues as well, so that my efforts                  to unify, organize, scientists to express freely was, like                  a lot of other researchers, was considered not so good. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But at that point&hellip; I understand that was                  sort of one more brick in the wall at that point, but you didn&rsquo;t                  actually stop doing that, stop doing the conferences because                  of that, did you?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; No. I kept going.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; I kept going and I&rsquo;ve lived to tell                  the story, and I&rsquo;m very grateful for that.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; That was through the &rsquo;90s.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. And at some point you also got involved with                  Mallove. Is that right?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right. Eugene Mallove was&hellip; just                  kind of to tell you the story briefly&hellip; was the chief                  science writer for MIT. He had a doctorate in education and                  was a brilliant writer. </p>                <p class="style7">In 1989 Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann, two chemists                  from the University of Utah, claimed that they&rsquo;d made                  a breakthrough called <em>cold fusion</em> in which, when they                  put a palladium cathode into a solution of heavy water, that,                  strangely enough, nuclear reactions would occur on the cathode                  to create helium and the release of thermal energy which was                  non-radioactive. </p>                <p class="style7">It was basically room-temperature fusion, which is quite different                  from the traditional definition of fusion, which is to simulate                  the hydrogen bomb, and build these enormous reactors called <em>Tokomacs                  -- </em>they cost tens of millions of dollars -- and would attempt                  to confine a plasma of hot hydrogen so that they can fuse together                  to release that thermal energy for generating electricity.                  Sort of like nuclear power, fission power, except it&rsquo;s                  fusion, and it&rsquo;s even more powerful. </p>                <p class="style7">And so what went on was this kind of philosophical falling-out.                  It was this typical &ldquo;scientific heresy&rdquo; type of                  thing where the hot fusion physicists, which pretty much controlled                  the Department of Energy at MIT and Caltech and places like                  that, immediately banded together and they tried to discredit                  this discovery. </p>                <p class="style7">So, Gene Mallove took an interest in this issue, and he at                  first had the prejudice just like we all do, I think, on the                  side of caution. [He] felt that: <em>Yes, these guys at the                  University of Utah are probably crazy</em>, and he would join                  the physicists at MIT and write a story about just what bunk                  and poppycock this cold fusion breakthrough was. </p>                <p class="style7">What Mallove found out, much to his surprise, was that the                  hot fusion scientists at MIT who tried to replicate the experiment&hellip; First                  of all, they didn&rsquo;t know the science. They weren&rsquo;t                  chemists. They were nuclear physicists, very different field.                  But also&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">The point is that Mallove found that the MIT hot fusion physicists                  were fudging their data to make it look like it wasn&rsquo;t                  there, whereas as in fact the data showed it was there. Their                  discovery was vindicated. </p>                <p class="style7">So this led Mallove to write an article that was like an                  expose on this, whereupon he was fired [laughs] from MIT. And                  then he started <em>Infinite Energy Magazine</em> and became                  a leading organizer of scientists and advocate of&hellip; at                  first it was cold fusion, then he expanded his repertoire to                  vacuum energy and various forms of advanced hydrogen energy.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And you used to write articles for his publication?                  Is that right?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. See, he started a magazine called <em>Infinite                    Energy</em>. Yes. Excellent magazine. I think it will go                    into history as one of the seminal, breakthrough publications                    of all time. </p>                <p class="style7">He would write scathing editorials about how the scientific                  community is stuck in the mud about questions like free energy,                  and he, I&rsquo;m sure, rattled a lot of cages in his work. </p>                <p class="style7">And then, of course, the rest is history. In 2004 some thieves                  broke into his house and brutally murdered him. We don&rsquo;t                  know the exact cause, but I think we know the motive. It&rsquo;s                  just too much of a coincidence, because he rattled a lot of                  cages. His loss was a great loss for me. He was one of my heroes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; So when you see heroes living in your time,                  and people with whom you have a close connection, and they&rsquo;re                  suddenly dead, it does cause concern.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And it was at that point -- because we&rsquo;re                  in Ecuador right now -- that I understand that you decided                  to actually leave the States.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, it was one of the reasons. Yes. One                  of the reasons was just to &ldquo;retire,&rdquo; just to, you                  know, live out our lives in peace and harmony but still do                  my work, you know, write books and give lectures and organize                  conferences. And that I intend to continue doing. </p>                <p class="style7">But I&rsquo;m really very glad to be here. It&rsquo;s so very                  peaceful. And, you know, I just hope that together we can create                  a bright new future that has an opportunity to move ahead. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that&rsquo;s one of my bottom-line messages now, is                  that people need to become more aware because logic alone,                  common sense alone, says we should leave no stone unturned                  in seeking clean energy sources for our future. </p>                <p class="style7">We should leave no stone unturned in our investigation of                  the ET phenomenon because there&rsquo;s a lot we can learn                  from this. </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s a lot we can do in the future to redirect us                  instead of having this to be the sole territory of black budgets                  and people who want to cover up things -- but the general public                  is not aware of this.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not aware that free energy,                  or solution energy, could be the Holy Grail of our time. And                  that&rsquo;s where the Camelot theme comes in.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the search for the Holy Grail.                  Well, the Holy Grail has been <em>found</em>. [Kerry laughs]                  It&rsquo;s just that most people don&rsquo;t realize that.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Well, so you seem to be like such an enigma,                  in a sense, because you were trained in the astronaut program.                  And then you went through academia, and you had to be highly                  rewarded during that time. Yet you still thought outside the                  box and you still made all these adventurous changes in your                  life. And then, here you are in Ecuador. Even that takes a                  great deal of courage, to leave everything you know and start                  a new life. </p>                <p class="style7">And this has got to be like a slap in the face of the military                  / industrial complex, that here you are, you&rsquo;ve become                  this incredible rebel, and yet you have all these degrees,                  and so on. </p>                <p class="style7">I know there was an issue where they tried to actually bury                  your background as an ex-astronaut, which is unbelievable.                  I know that there actually has been some attempt to change                  the definition of what an <em>ex-astronaut</em> or an <em>astronaut                  candidate</em> is so that they could actually wipe your record                  clean. </p>                <p class="style7">I think you&rsquo;ve had more than one experience in this                  way. And there are certainly many people out there that have                  had similar things happen to them, especially when they&rsquo;re                  rebels, free thinkers, people that are going outside the box                  of the old paradigm. So if you could talk a little bit about                  what happened to you?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes, Kerry. Well, I was appointed to the                  astronaut program in 1967, and my title then was <em>astronaut</em>.                  I even have hanging on the wall here&hellip; I don&rsquo;t                  have the accurate date, but I&rsquo;d say roughly around 1990                  it came to my attention&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">Well, I&rsquo;ll backtrack a little bit. A reporter from the <em>San                    Diego Union Tribune</em> interviewed me after I gave a talk                    in San Diego. Part of my credentials said &ldquo;ex-astronaut&rdquo;.                    And one of the people on the board of the <em>San Diego Union                    Tribune</em> was Wally Schirra, one of the original seven                    Mercury astronauts who, unbeknownst to me, formed what was                    called The Society for Space Explorers, in which the term <em>astronaut</em> was                    redefined to &ldquo;anybody that went 50 miles above the                    Earth&rsquo;s surface.&rdquo; </p>                <p class="style7">So in a way I was defrocked when Schirra hit the ceiling,                  and apparently the reporter lost his position&hellip; just                  like the first reporter that covered the first Wright brothers&rsquo; flight                  was fired from his position by his editor for not believing                  that heavier-than-air flight was possible. So this is just,                  once again, a reporter was fired for using the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; credential.                  Well, I found that out. </p>                <p class="style7">And then shortly after that, an organization with which I                  worked some, MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network in the US, also                  it came to their attention that maybe in fact I was not an                  astronaut. [Kerry laughs] So they wrote to NASA, and NASA said: <em>Well                  in fact he wasn&rsquo;t.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; They said you were NOT.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; I was not.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; They actually wrote to NASA? </p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, I think so. I&rsquo;m not absolutely                  sure of the details, but I can tell you who would know is Bob                  Bletchman, who was the lawyer for MUFON at the time.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Uh huh.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Anyway, Bob Bletchman wrote me, and it was                  kind of a challenging letter that basically said: <em>Many                  of us feel that you misrepresented your credentials.</em> So                  I presented my credentials to Bob Bletchman and he became convinced                  that, indeed, that was my title at the time, and that indeed                  it was appropriate to use that in my credentials. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Incredible.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Not that I used it all the time because,                  actually, I wouldn&rsquo;t, because I was trying to get away                  from that controversy. And, you know, there&rsquo;s much more                  about me besides being an ex-astronaut that&rsquo;s kind of                  interesting anyway. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">So it didn&rsquo;t matter to me too much one way or the other.                  But I got vindicated because MUFON challenged me in public                  and then later vindicated me, that indeed I was an astronaut.                  So that was cleared up.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, on another occasion: For a year I had a visiting faculty                  appointment at Caltech during the Mariner 10 mission in which                  I was deputy team leader of the Television Imaging Science                  Team for Mariner 10 that went by Venus and Mercury during the                  1970s. </p>                <p class="style7">Professor Bruce Murray, who later became the director of JPL,                  appointed me deputy team leader during that time. I was at                  Caltech and worked on the mission with him and some of the                  other scientists. </p>                <p class="style7">So, fast-forward to the year 2000 and a very bright senior                  honors physics student who knew that I was researching solution                  energies such as cold fusion and so forth said: <em>Gee, you                  ought to come to Caltech. Would you like to speak at our Commencement                  as a speaker for Alternative Future Science such as cold fusion?</em> And                  I said I would be happy to. </p>                <p class="style7">So they scheduled it. They started posting things and advertising                  the event. Then this one professor that I had worked for, who                  later became director of JPL, apparently actively tried to                  suppress the entire gig. </p>                <p class="style7">And then it turned out that there was no record that I was                  even at&hellip; Caltech denied that I was deputy team leader,                  denied that I was even at Caltech. [Kerry laughs] But it was                  so simple because I&rsquo;d published papers, well, in <em>Science</em> and                  other journals, and Caltech was the affiliation that was under                  my name. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And not only that, you had to have colleagues who                  remember you, you know, who are still there even, I&rsquo;m                  sure.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Exactly. Yes, absolutely.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s an amazing thing.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Amazing thing. They tried to erase it and                  I thought: <em>Gee, maybe I could find some paycheck stubs                  or something like that.</em> Because apparently I was wiped                  off the Caltech records that I was even there -- even in their                  Administration -- because I tried to follow that one up.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So if somebody was doing an article on you and wanted                  to investigate and called Caltech today, they will say that                  you never worked there.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Exactly.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Amazing.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; It just shows you how the machine works. And I think                  that this is very instructive to many people who challenge                  a lot of whistleblowers on the fact that their credentials                  have disappeared, you know?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So this is very instructive. Here you are, working                  in free energy. You&rsquo;re an ex-astronaut. I know there&rsquo;s                  a video on Google in which you are actually speaking before                  the White House during the Bush administration, not so long                  ago. And you know, very fiery, very impressive, very courageous,                  basically saying that Bush should not be in office and talking                  to some degree about the cover-up. </p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s tremendously courageous, and yet I didn&rsquo;t                  know anything about it until we started to investigate coming                  to see you and all. Can you talk a little bit about that? </p>                <p class="style7">And then I know that you also did the same thing back in the                  Nixon administration, but the number of people around you was                  strikingly reduced. And I want to do that because I want to                  talk about how times are changing.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And what may be coming down the line.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. It&rsquo;s very sad for me to see                  this develop. </p>                <p class="style7">And, yes, you&rsquo;re right, Kerry, that in 1970 I was an                  anti-Vietnam War protestor, and along with other people from                  Cornell and many places there were about 100,000 of us. When                  Cambodia was invaded, we marched on Washington towards the                  White House. A number of us that were leaders of this protest                  locked arms and tried to walk between a line of buses that                  was blocking the White House from us. </p>                <p class="style7">We were fully expecting to be handcuffed and arrested -- which                  was fine, you know; it was an act of civil disobedience. Instead,                  we were invited into the White House to express our outrage                  with some of Nixon&rsquo;s advisors. </p>                <p class="style7">And then just after that, some of us&hellip; I think the interview                  with me was the lead story on <em>CBS Evening News</em>. It                  would have been, and you can probably look it up, I think it                  was April 30, 1970.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And there was also a certain number of people that                  attended that.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; 100,000.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Which is amazing.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; And by contrast, I joined a protest march                  onto the White House in 2007. No&hellip; 2006. It was the fifth                  anniversary of 9/11 and there were a few, it was a motley crew                  of about 30 of us. [Kerry laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">It was a beautiful day. It was September 11, 2006 and we marched                  to the White House. Some of my 9/11 Truther friends and I gave                  little speeches in front of the White House. </p>                <p class="style7">And what I felt there was that Washington had changed, that                  it was no longer a place where there&rsquo;d be any democratic                  discourse. Instead, it was a locked shop. It was like people                  were robotically walking around, business as usual. </p>                <p class="style7">To me, 9/11 Truth is sort of like a metaphor for what&rsquo;s                  going on now. There are other truths, too, of course, like                  solution energy truth, truths that are being covered up, but                  it&rsquo;s being covered up also by people who are otherwise                  intelligent and free-thinking and progressive. Those people                  aren&rsquo;t there either. They&rsquo;re buying into the system. </p>                <p class="style7">The system itself has become kind of locked up. And this is                  so sad to me. The reason why I guess I have what you might                  call some degree of courage, other people might call it naivety                  or foolishness, is that I sometimes think: <em>It&rsquo;s either                  the Earth or Me</em>, or anybody else that wants to try to                  make a difference and bring in the new paradigm. </p>                <p class="style7">Because I happen to think we <em>can</em> have a new paradigm,                  but we need to stand and be counted. We need to go to the White                  House, bang pots. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, we had a change in the presidency of Ecuador, a very                  positive change, as a result of about a million people getting                  out there in front of the presidential palace and banging pots                  until the president left. That&rsquo;s non-violent. It&rsquo;s                  a method of changing. </p>                <p class="style7">And what&rsquo;s happening now in the US is very scary because                  the people in charge that are obviously pulling the strings                  of the politicians, bribing them&hellip; and it&rsquo;s so                  obvious, especially seen from here, to see the decline of the                  culture in just about every respect, whether it&rsquo;s economic,                  ecological, peace vs. war&hellip; It&rsquo;s locked up. It&rsquo;s                  a closed shop. </p>                <p class="style7">There are a few courageous people around that I know, friends                  like Dennis Kucinich and, you know, some of the others, Cynthia                  McKinney. I&rsquo;ve done some work with Ralph Nader, although                  I couldn&rsquo;t convince him that solution energy was possible.                  There are a lot of people that do stand on the good side of                  the force, but they&rsquo;re very few and far between now.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; And I want to be joined by people. I need                  support. I need to team up with more and more people who feel                  as I do and are willing to stand and be counted.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, can you talk&hellip; Just name a few names                  if you don&rsquo;t mind, of the people that are actually in                  more or less the alternative world but they&rsquo;re not willing                  to actually embrace the ideas of free energy, even UFOs? You                  know, the idea that there might be black projects out there?                  I mean, because we had talked briefly, and I know that you                  talked about&hellip; Some of these people are actually good                  friends of yours.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. There are many people in the progressive                  community. I would say Kucinich himself is in this category.                  He&rsquo;s been on the fence. I was able to script for him                  an interview he had with NPR when he was running for president                  in 2004. I was advising him on solution energy and trying to                  come up with the right words so that he could become all-inclusive                  about, you know, leaving no stone unturned in our quest for                  new energy sources. </p>                <p class="style7">And so Kucinich did a little of that, but then he kind of                  retrenched some. There were a number of glitches that came                  up, but he wanted to create some legislation that would provide                  funding for New Energy research and development, which is what                  we really need. We need an Apollo Program for this. We need                  to bring people under one roof to research it. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Or to somehow in other ways support the                  work. Well&hellip; which is not happening now, of course. But                  there are other people&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But there are other thinkers that are very&hellip; movers                  and shakers in many ways, criticizing the current paradigm.                  They&rsquo;re very courageous in that way. And yet they won&rsquo;t,                  they actually won&rsquo;t go outside the box, to a certain                  degree.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Exactly. They&rsquo;re what Wade Frazier,                  a good friend, and I call <em>structuralists</em>. These are                  people like Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, and they&rsquo;re also                  the kind of people that won&rsquo;t look at 9/11 Truth, so                  there&rsquo;s a pattern here. [Kerry laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s a pattern of various things that become what                  David Ray Griffin calls <em>sacred myths.</em> One sacred myth                  is the official story of 9/11: It&rsquo;s true, and it&rsquo;s                  obviously true, and there&rsquo;s no disputing it. </p>                <p class="style7">Another sacred myth is that there&rsquo;s no such thing as                  a free lunch when it comes to energy. So you have all of these                  environmentalists that are just nay-saying even the <em>possibility</em> of                  free energy, and this would be a number of notable people,                  people on the cutting edge of environmental policy. I&rsquo;ve                  broached this to many famous well-known people. I&rsquo;ll                  list a few.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Please do.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; OK. Amory Lovens. Lester Brown, formerly                  of the Worldwatch Institute. Amory just walked away from me                  when I broached it, and I&rsquo;ve known him for years.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Are they afraid? You know, can you actually sort                  of drill down a little and tell us? Do you think that it&rsquo;s&hellip; are                  they afraid? Or is it something else? Is it the matrix, that                  they&rsquo;ve actually bought into the matrix and that was                  it, they couldn&rsquo;t get beyond that? They&rsquo;re certainly                  critics of the society, but they don&rsquo;t, you know&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. That&rsquo;s an excellent question,                  Kerry, and I can&rsquo;t second-guess their negative reaction                  because I&rsquo;m not in their skin, but it might be a blend                  of the two. </p>                <p class="style7">I know that it was politically correct and sort of <em>de                    rigueur</em> when I was in the mainstream of science to nay-say                    and deny anything that fell outside the box, and then I was                    accepted. So some of it&rsquo;s cultural, for sure. </p>                <p class="style7">Somebody like Amory Lovens or Noam Chomsky or Naomi Klein,                  and there are many other names too. I can probably pop for                  several more whose bias, or let&rsquo;s say <em>critique</em> of                  the culture is narrowly confined to certain areas. Now, on                  the other hand, I have to grant them that maybe they just didn&rsquo;t                  have time to look at these other things&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; &hellip;like the energy or 9/11 Truth. But                  on the other hand, maybe they are in the matrix. Maybe fear                  has so captivated them that they&rsquo;re in the box.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, don&rsquo;t you have a story about &ldquo;The                  Carrot and The Stick&rdquo;? I think that this would be a great                  opportunity to talk about it. Because it may not be just fear                  but also the reward system that they get, through &rdquo;normal                  society&rdquo;, if you will. </p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, yes. And I think that many people&hellip; and                  I&rsquo;ve broken free of it, but it took me a long time, and                  it took a lot of truth-seeking. </p>                <p class="style7">But, yes, a lot of people&hellip; Yes. Yes, they basically                  realize that their careers could be ruined by this. I don&rsquo;t                  think most of them get to the point where there are threats,                  but yes, some people are offered very lucrative opportunities                  to &ldquo;join the team&rdquo; by The Powers That Be, to come                  over to their side. And when that doesn&rsquo;t happen, then                  often they&rsquo;re whacked by the stick. </p>                <p class="style7">John Perkins talks about this in his books, the first one                  of which is the <em>Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</em>,                  that carrots are dangled. Like, it could come in the form of                  a World Bank loan, or it could come in the form to buy you                  out, not to do the free energy invention. Or it could be being                  recruited to be part of their team, and becoming privy to some                  information that you otherwise couldn&rsquo;t get.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, certainly funding for experimentation -- From                  the point of view of a scientist, that&rsquo;s always the most                  seductive thing, one would assume.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right. And a lot of free energy                  inventors&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">Now, for example, the Patent Office has a policy to nay-say                  anything that smacks of free energy. Or the Department of Defense                  has the Secrecy Law which says that if this device has any                  defense application -- [laughs] <em>offense </em>application                  -- then you&rsquo;re going to have your device confiscated and                  you can never work on it again. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, along those lines, let&rsquo;s actually move                  along to free energy. And I know you&rsquo;ve done a tremendous                  amount of investigation here, but you&rsquo;ve also investigated                  the cover-up of free energy and the people that have maybe                  gotten to a certain point and then been, I don&rsquo;t know,                  hit in one way or another, the device stolen. </p>                <p class="style7">Do you have some anecdotes along those lines and some people                  that you can talk about who&rsquo;ve done investigations? I                  know you traveled the world doing some&hellip; in one of your                  books talking about that.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, yes. I mean, first of all, there are                  many inventors who have been assassinated, threatened, had                  their funding removed. And I can go through the list. Obviously                  you&rsquo;ll be able to post the list and their stories. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve been able to authenticate                  many of these stories myself, personally, and they&rsquo;re                  pretty much right-on. </p>                <p class="style7">But they&rsquo;re people like Tom Bearden. There&rsquo;s a                  man called Gary Vesperman, who&rsquo;s accumulated many, many                  suppression stories of all kinds, for free energy. </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s Wade Frazier and his excellent website <a href="https://ahealedplanet.net">www.ahealedplanet.net</a> in                  which he explores, in many hundreds of pages, many suppression                  stories and some of his own experience with the inventor and                  promoter, Dennis Lee. And there are just so many others. </p>                <p class="style7">You know, that&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;ve said in                  my &ldquo;Carrot and the Stick&rdquo; story, is that there                  are a thousand ways to suppress an inventor or researcher.                  And there are also a thousand ways to eliminate them or threaten                  them. And there are&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s also, we&rsquo;re also vulnerable to forces because                  we have these bodies and these bodies are very vulnerable to                  any kind of attack or threat, and those of our loved ones.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; So in a sense, The Powers That Be hold all                  the cards right now, and most people are afraid to even venture                  into this territory. </p>                <p class="style7">And that, in part, is also a psychological phenomenon. There&rsquo;s                  been some really good research done on this, that the pain                  center of the brain is hit as soon as you start to talk about                  anything that smacks of conspiracy theory (which, of course,                  is the dismissal that&rsquo;s really <em>truth-seeking</em>),&nbsp; that                  anything, any painful new truth is going to reach the pain                  center of the brain first. </p>                <p class="style7">Whereas, if you join the lynch mob, [laughs] if you join The                  Powers That Be, then everything is pretty comfortable. The                  pleasure center. You can have fun with life.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; So in a way, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Me or                    the Earth&rdquo;.</em> [laughs] That&rsquo;s the way it seems                    to be, and this dark agenda which is not really so hidden                    now if people only take the time out and look at that. </p>                <p class="style7">But also look at the great promise and potential of solution                  energy. It&rsquo;s really a one-two punch in education that&rsquo;s                  necessary. </p>                <p class="style7">But at the same time I have <em>many</em> wonderful dear friends,                  progressive people, otherwise progressive, who still can&rsquo;t                  get their heads around the free energy question because they                  say: <em>Well, you know, if you show it to me then I&rsquo;ll                  believe it, but until then it&rsquo;s not worth looking at                  as a question.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, George Green is a friend of yours and he&rsquo;s                  been working with John Bedini. And you know, George is one                  of those people who is certainly on the side of free energy                  and is certainly aware of it. Have you seen a device, or have                  you seen John Bedini&rsquo;s work? And what might you think                  of that? And so on.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Oh yes. I visited many laboratories and                  visited a lot of people and I took photographs of them, but                  I&rsquo;ve also investigated in great detail the concepts. </p>                <p class="style7">[Showing pictures in his book]: Like, for example, this man                  is Sparky Sweet, or Floyd Sweet. I visited him in the &rsquo;90s.                  He&rsquo;s passed over now. And this is a specially conditioned                  magnet that he was showing. It produces free energy. </p>                <p class="style7">His laboratory was in an undisclosed location in the Mojave                  Desert<strong>.</strong> He had before been in LA and was broken                  into, his laboratory was broken into. He was threatened. They                  were spying on him with infrared cameras. You know, all of                  this was well documented. </p>                <p class="style7">This is Bruce DePalma, who invented the N-machine while he                  was at MIT. And he was so suppressed by the Securities and                  Exchange Commission when he tried to start his own company,                  he immigrated to Australia. They didn&rsquo;t like it there,                  either, so he immigrated to New Zealand and died young of a                  heart attack, about a decade ago. </p>                <p class="style7">This is some of Bruce&rsquo;s apparatus. It&rsquo;s an N-machine.                  It&rsquo;s basically a magnetic motor, magnets that go up on                  a wheel that are spun up and then they interact with a hypothesized                  zero-point vacuum energy field and you get free energy. You                  get over-unity power. </p>                <p class="style7">This is Paramahamsa Tewari in India who had demonstrated a                  version of the N-machine which is magnets on a motor, on a                  wheel. Now, Tewari is a very prestigious physicist. He works                  for the government of India. </p>                <p class="style7">He was chief project engineer of their largest nuclear power                  plant, but they also&hellip; the government of India gave him                  laboratory space and funding to develop this machine which                  he demonstrated to me, and which was lighting light bulbs with                  the machine being unplugged. It was just free-running for 20,                  30 minutes. And the basic principles were very, very well presented                  to me, photographed. It&rsquo;s there for everybody to see.</p>                <p class="style7">This is Shiuji Inomata. He also passed over at a relatively                  young age. He worked for the Tsukuba Space Center in Japan,                  also a Ph.D. physicist and president of the Japan Psychotronics                  Institute. And he had also one of these magnetic motors which                  was spinning up and producing excess energy. And, again, he                  died young. Most of all these people die young.</p>                <p class="style7">This is John Hutchison, from Canada.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. Well, we have had interactions with John                  and actually we&rsquo;d love to interview him at some point.                  Can you tell us, you know, your take on his&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. John has personal psychic powers, but                  he&rsquo;s also <em>brilliant</em> with machines. So this is                  John and he actually was taking Meredith&rsquo;s Camelot sword,                  and then he took this bar of what he would call <em>al-u-min-ium</em> which                  was thoroughly trashed by one of his Tesla coils. And of course                  the US Department of Defense immediately took an interest in                  this, for reasons other than John. </p>                <p class="style7">John is a loving, gentle soul and he basically has demonstrated                  many times over how he can produce free energy just from specially                  conditioned magnets.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; He&rsquo;d be a good one to interview. He&rsquo;s                  a wonderful guy and he&rsquo;s also done many experiments levitating                  objects and producing free energy.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes.

Moray King. These are leading                  theorists.

Could we name                  him?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, I think I&rsquo;d rather not because&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; My comments weren&rsquo;t always positive                  but he convened these people with the intention of trying to                  find out the best and brightest researchers and the best concepts                  to fund.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; And then he suddenly did a reversal and                  said: <em>No, I&rsquo;m not going to fund any of this because                  my marketing people told me that we were not dipping into the                  river of optimized profits. </em>[Kerry laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">In other words, when you&rsquo;re in the toe of the profit                  curve&hellip; We&rsquo;re still at the Research phase of the                  Research-and-Development cycle. </p>                <p class="style7">So that&rsquo;s what the government is supposed to be doing.                  The Department of Energy is supposed to be funding these things.                  And my god, they&rsquo;re hardly even funding solar and wind!                  They&rsquo;re totally steeped in nuclear weapons, nuclear power,                  and fossil fuel power. </p>                <p class="style7">But in this picture there are some people, really sad cases.                  This was Stefan Marinov, who was Europe&rsquo;s leading free                  energy inventor and researcher. He was a professor of physics                  at the University of Graz in Austria. Jolly fellow, wonderful                  man, just positive and upbeat. And a few years ago, a few years                  after this conference, he was seen jumping off the 10th story                  of the library building, to his death.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Incredible.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Some people saw him going backwards. It                  looked like he was pushed off. And again, it&rsquo;s just another                  one of these cases. </p>                <p class="style7">There are many other people in this picture who are no longer                  alive, but these are the leading free energy researchers from                  all over the word. And Jim Carrey, who was filming <em>Dumb                  and Dumber,</em> while we were trying to get <em>smart and                  smarter</em>. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; [laughs] Yes. Interesting. So... OK. Let&rsquo;s                  go from here to what kind of solutions you&rsquo;re advocating,                  or where you think we can go for the future, just to sort of                  inspire all the people that are listening to this. Because                  truly you are a very inspiring man and, you know, your courage,                  your willingness to think outside of the box, and then in the                  face of all odds, to persist on this road. I mean, you just                  released this new book. Right?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Right. <em>The Energy Solution Revolution.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly. So what is it that your book is about?                  What are you advocating? And how can you encourage, or give                  us an encouraging word, about the future, if you have one?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>                  BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, I think the bottom line of this&hellip; This                  is the book and I&rsquo;ve been working on it for about 6 years.                  It&rsquo;s kind of different essays, but they all come together                  because they first talk about, well, just looking at the table                  of contents, that it&rsquo;s being covered up at every turn.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; There is hardly anybody alive that&rsquo;s                  NOT covering it up, either by commission or omission.</p>                <p class="style7">Orwell one time said: <em>The greatest lies are lies of omission</em>.                  And so a lot of people who are otherwise progressive and enlightened                  and very bright just suppress it. </p>                <p class="style7">And so this book is a study of the breakthroughs and the suppression.                  Also the ecological mandate, the fact that the problems with                  the Earth are far greater than you would be led to believe                  in the media. </p>                <p class="style7">Then I talk about: <em>Well, what is this tyranny and how                    can we overcome it?</em> Well, we can certainly overcome                    it by education and by revamping our political systems. </p>                <p class="style7">Right now I think people are beginning to wake up to the fact                  that even Obama doesn&rsquo;t really represent change. He&rsquo;s                  great rhetorically. </p>                <p class="style7">But all these people, and I would include in there a lot of                  people that are otherwise progressive that we have already                  talked about plus many others, leaders of the environmental                  movement, for example -- that the cover-up is fairly complete.                  And in a sense it&rsquo;s very similar to the UFO/ET phenomenon,                  to 9/11, anything else where conventional wisdom denies it.</p>                <p class="style7">And so, I kind of pick this apart. I try to ask: <em>Well,                    who&rsquo;s doing the denying?</em> Scientists are doing                    it. They are the guardians at the gate. </p>                <p class="style7">People who call themselves scientists are the number one suppressors.                  And so they&rsquo;re in unwitting alliance with the Black Ops                  people because, you know, if the scientists won&rsquo;t give                  it the possibility, the yes-nod, then it probably won&rsquo;t                  get anywhere. It&rsquo;s sort of like&hellip; Galileo&rsquo;s                  colleagues refused to look through his telescope.</p>                <p class="style7">Then you have the environmentalists and I&rsquo;ve talked                  with many leading environmentalists. </p>                <p class="style7">Here&rsquo;s another example: Hazel Henderson, a leading progressive                  economist, doesn&rsquo;t want free energy because she doesn&rsquo;t                  want millions of helicopters in the sky and bigger power saws. <br>                  And I don&rsquo;t blame her. </p>                <p class="style7">So that then forces the question: <em>Well, this has to be                    managed</em>. We don&rsquo;t want Dick Cheney running this                    one again. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; So the environmentalists are suppressing                  it. I don&rsquo;t know of a mainstream environmentalist that&rsquo;s                  even willing to give it a moment of thought.</p>                <p class="style7">Al Gore. There&rsquo;s another example of somebody who&hellip; I&rsquo;ve                  written letters to him. He doesn&rsquo;t answer. So my battle                  is very lonely. [laughter] And then&hellip; what else?</p>                <p class="style7">Well, there&rsquo;s the corporations. The CEO of General Electric                  wrote this editorial for the <em>Washington Post</em> saying                  that we need the courage to change to new energy solutions.                  And then he mentions the conditions under which this has to                  happen. </p>                <p class="style7">One is the creative mind. He thinks yes, we have that. And                  then the second one was: <em>It must turn over a profit.</em> And                  then the third one was the American will. And he sees the third                  ingredient <em>lacking</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">I see the second ingredient as <em>interfering</em>, because                  General Electric&rsquo;s profits&hellip; and their shareholders                  depend on their making nuclear power plants and gas turbine                  plants. </p>                <p class="style7">If you were to have a free energy gizmo that could fit in                  the palm of your hand, just like your dictaphone there, that                  could produce 10 kilowatts of power, which I fully believe                  can happen some day, General Electric is not going to want to                  develop it because it would take away from their business with                  gas turbine plants and nuclear power plants. </p>                <p class="style7">So, the condition to turn over a profit&hellip; I kind of                  argue: <em>Well, how much profit is enough?</em> Clearly General                  Electric is not at all interested in this. And, you know, the                  multi-national corporations and the government have been suppressing                  these things anyway. That&rsquo;s obvious. </p>                <p class="style7">So this book is all about documenting the efforts not only                  to break through but to suppress it. And even in light of what                  so many people say&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">When is there a day when you don&rsquo;t pick up a newspaper                  or hear some sort of thing on the media that: <em>Al Gore says                  we need to do something about this soon.</em> [Kerry laughs] <em>We                  need to develop alternate energy.</em> And then, when it comes                  to the question of &ldquo;what&rdquo;, the question is evaded.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Or at the very least it&rsquo;s lip service                  given to solar and wind, which is very capital-intensive, materials-intensive.                  It&rsquo;s not truly renewable. It&rsquo;s intermittent. It&rsquo;s                  diffuse.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t Obama also talking about, you know,                  going back into coal?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I mean, we&rsquo;re actually going backwards. Now                  the Black Ops of course, we document here in Camelot, are thousands                  of years ahead and they&rsquo;ve got free energy and they&rsquo;re                  using it as we speak now. I think that you told us you wrote                  to Obama. Is this correct?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. Recently. And it&rsquo;s                  on my website <a href="https://brianoleary.com" target="_blank">brianoleary.com</a>.                  It&rsquo;s right there on the home page. It&rsquo;s an open                  appeal to Obama to really represent the change we need and                  not just in rhetorical means. </p>                <p class="style7">For that you&rsquo;re going to have to bite the hand that fed                  you. You&rsquo;re going to have to go against these very wealthy                  elite people that are holding the puppet strings, including                  his strings. </p>                <p class="style7">And we have to become educated about what the possibilities                  are. And what&rsquo;s happened is, as you say, he&rsquo;s gone                  backwards. He&rsquo;s talking about &ldquo;clean&rdquo; coal.                  [Kerry laughs] There&rsquo;s no such thing! That&rsquo;s an                  oxymoron. Or about advanced nuclear. Or sequestration at coal                  power plants, which is not even feasible and it&rsquo;s a gross                  technology. </p>                <p class="style7">So, he&rsquo;s just <em>far</em> behind in the curve. And                  so I&rsquo;m just making an appeal to him to say that, you                  know: <em>Please for heaven&rsquo;s sake, our planet is being                  destroyed. Will you please serve the public interest because                  the public interest is not being served with what&rsquo;s happening.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And even solar and wind, I hate to say, are half-measures                  because the capital cost of a solar or wind economy is on the                  order of 20 to 40 trillions dollars. We don&rsquo;t have that                  kind of money. </p>                <p class="style7">Free energy is basically <em>free</em>, once we&rsquo;re able                  to develop the hardware to the point where it becomes available.                  And then of course, all hell will break loose.</p>                <p class="style7">But, you know, the suppression effort&hellip; There&rsquo;s                  two great quotes here. Let me see if I can find &rsquo;em. </p>                <p class="style7">This is one: <em>In a time of universal deceit, telling the                    truth becomes a revolutionary act.</em> &ndash; George Orwell.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on right                  now. We&rsquo;re being deceived. Big time.</p>                <p class="style7">Here&rsquo;s another one: <em>When stupidity is considered                    patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent.</em> &ndash; Isaac                    Asimov.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes. And there you go. That&rsquo;s <em>Dumb and                    Dumber</em> and the big rush to have movies emphasizing how                    funny, how lovely, it is to be stupid. </p>                <p class="style7">So&hellip; OK. This has been really amazing, Brian, and I                  have to say that if ex-astronaut Brian O&rsquo;Leary was writing                  to me, and I was the president, certainly it almost seems like                  to you need to write back. Or to Al Gore. Right? And isn&rsquo;t                  it surprising that, with your stature, that these men would                  actually ignore you? There&rsquo;s something to be said there,                  as well.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, yes, there is something to be said                  there, and it suggests to me that they&rsquo;re part of the                  overall dark agenda.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s just their wrinkle on it                  is a little different. It&rsquo;s a little more benign-sounding.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; One could just even be so risqu&eacute; as                  to say that they advocate genocide by other means. I&rsquo;m                  not really sure what&rsquo;s going on in their minds. All I                  know is that their lack of answers and the lack of answers                  from the people they surround themselves with and people that                  espouse the conventional wisdom&hellip; <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>                  I mean, even James Lovelock in England. He thinks outside the                  box, but he&rsquo;s unbudgable. Amory Lovens. That&rsquo;s                  another one who thinks outside the box, but not enough. Now: <em>What&rsquo;s                  happening?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Now, these are also the kinds of people that show up at the                  so-called Green Salons in Washington, DC. It&rsquo;s like the                  whole Beltway of Washington is a fortress and that it&rsquo;s                  almost a sign of prestige to interact with some of the folks                  at the DoD and CIA because it might be your passport to&hellip; Something.                  [laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">And meanwhile outside the box there are all these wonderful                  concepts waiting in the wings...</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; &hellip;that could really create a sustainable                  future for humankind. And these people don&rsquo;t listen.                  I mean, I&rsquo;ve had some access to Al Gore through intermediaries                  that know him and they won&rsquo;t budge. You know. I could                  name names there, too. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s just that the conventional wisdom pervades the                  entire progressive community. It&rsquo;s like a big disease                  that&rsquo;s affected everybody. And then most people are simply                  apathetic or they don&rsquo;t know. </p>                <p class="style7">Wade Frazier says: <em>You have to peel the onion of free                    energy.</em> And what that means is a combination of a certain                    degree of open-mindedness, intelligence, sentience, spiritual                    development, and on and on.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. In other words, it&rsquo;s such a powerful                  theoretical technology, or reality for those that are using                  it, its possibilities are so grand, that you actually have                  to be on a certain level spiritually to deal with that, as                  a planet. And I think that that&rsquo;s also where we&rsquo;re                  going and where we&rsquo;re going to have to come to terms.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Because as long as war and weapons is our god, so                  to speak, on this planet, free energy is just not appropriate                  to be used by those people.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; You&rsquo;re totally right. You&rsquo;re                  totally right, Kerry.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So we need a totally different set of leaders, a                  different set of thinking. Right?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And in many ways you&rsquo;re right on the <em>avant                    garde</em> of that effort. And I do believe you have many                    people behind you.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s good, Kerry, and they&rsquo;re                  now kind of divided and ruled. And of course part of your effort                  and your search for the Holy Grail, which this is a part of,                  a significant part of, could create more strength in numbers                  of people willing to stand and be counted for proposing these                  alternatives. </p>                <p class="style7">Because I, too, would be actually opposed to the development                  of free energy if The Powers That Be continue to be in power,                  because they would abuse it.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; They would misuse it. They would&hellip; just                  like in the ET phenomenon, back-engineering and so forth, they&rsquo;d                  keep it in the Black [Ops] and use it for their own purposes. </p>                <p class="style7">So the people of the Earth need to know about this more. </p>                <p class="style7">There are some hopeful signs here. One of them is the country                  of Ecuador, whose president is a great deal more enlightened                  than prior presidents, and whose government just passed a new                  constitution which provides for the Rights of Nature -- and                  whose president has offered that if the world community were                  to attract matching funding, that oil under the ground in a                  very pristine bio-diverse national park would stay in the ground,                  if the funds could be raised enough. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, you see, the whole thing is systemic. The whole world                  system is decadent and disgustingly&hellip; I just&hellip; You                  name the negative word. <em>Evil</em>, I guess, is the right                  word for it. </p>                <p class="style7">More and more people are realizing that, but maybe what they                  don&rsquo;t realize is that we <em>can</em> make a difference.                  We can create another agenda, together. </p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t talk much about alternative agenda to the Black                  Ops or Illuminati agenda, but believe me, it&rsquo;s a lot                  more pleasant. [Kerry laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t even want to prejudice the question: <em>Well,                    what is that agenda?</em> Well, I can see a world that&rsquo;s                    truly sustainable, a world in which our knowledge expands                    to embrace the ET phenomenon, a world where magic, what we                    consider as magic, can now really happen. A world where combined                    positive intention can heal ourselves and the environment.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; And where consciousness, which is really                  the science of the 21st century, can burst forward in very                  dramatic counterpoint to what now is happening.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; OK. Well, thank you Brian. That&rsquo;s wonderful.                  And more power to you! It&rsquo;s been really educational for                  Bill and I to be here. We want to thank you for being our host                  and Meredith, a lovely hostess, and for opening your home to                  us. </p>                <p class="style7">We just completed a conference here that you organized and                  it was very inspiring. I think a lot of people really enjoyed                  it. We hope to do more of them. And certainly, again, here                  you are on the <em>avant garde</em> of actually getting the                  word out, not only about free energy but about, you know, what&rsquo;s                  been going on, the cover-up, and the potential for the future                  that is there for all of us if we just take hold.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. We&rsquo;re starting here, Kerry, an                  alternative educational and conference center. It&rsquo;s called <em>Montesuenos</em>.                  It&rsquo;s in the Andes of Ecuador. My wife, Meredith, and                  I have been spending the last five years creating it and now                  blessed by your presence and the conference that we just had.                  We expect to have many more. And we invite kindred spirits.                  And whistleblowers! [laughter]</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely. The more truth-tellers, the better.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes! And that&rsquo;s such an important                  thing. Your work is very important. Somebody had to do the                  work. Steve Greer has done a piece of it and is doing a piece                  of it. And together we can then enlighten ourselves and the                  public about, first of all, the nasty truth, and then the potential                  truth of what <em>could</em> be in a better world. And then                  together create that world. There&rsquo;s no reason why we                  can&rsquo;t do that.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely. Thank you very much, Brian. Yes. I                  think we covered it all.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; One thing, though, I&rsquo;ve never been                  in Black Ops and I&rsquo;ve never been privy to it, even as                  an astronaut.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; So, it&rsquo;s funny because I know most                  of the people you interview have been there. And that&rsquo;s                  a whole different order of things.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; I kind of come on naively.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. But you skirted it. You&rsquo;ve been affected                  by them. They see you as a threat and in some ways that&rsquo;s                  just as good, from Camelot&rsquo;s point of view. You know,                  you definitely qualify, if you will, [Brian laughs] for better                  or for worse. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that the wonderful thing about your life is that you&rsquo;ve                  actually lived through all these experiences as an astronaut.                  Right? So, as a person of respect, that garners respect, and                  a person who people could rally around, at the same time you&rsquo;re                  willing to have such an open mind and consider everything.                  And that&rsquo;s such a rare thing to get in a person of respect                  nowadays, I&rsquo;m sorry to say.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. And in my case I guess I just had                  to check it out as I went along and my gestation of many of                  these things took a LONG time. So now I&rsquo;m hoping for                  others in the lay public and just people, curious people&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">The kind of people that came to the conference were just <em>fine</em> people                  that want to get educated more about these things, and who                  may not&hellip; we may not&hellip; have as much luxury of time                  as I had when I was going through my process of decompression                  from the mainstream. It&rsquo;s been 30 years so far, and that                  process continues to this very moment.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; I guess we could say that you&rsquo;re in <em>Green                  Ops.</em></p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Green Ops. Yes. [laughs] That&rsquo;s great.                  Green Ops. You know, we ought to have an Earth Corps. We ought                  to have a &ldquo;New Deal&rdquo; [that] Obama could lead that                  would get people out to clean up the Earth. And have solution                  energy research and development. And consciousness research                  and make it OK to do those things. Why not?</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yes. Absolutely. Why not?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes. But it has to have public support.                  You can&rsquo;t do it without the public. History has shown                  that throughout.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s what doing this video is going to                  do. That&rsquo;s the whole point of doing things like this.                  I mean, your book coming out, and hopefully the video coming                  out very shortly, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that&rsquo;s                  going to start the movement and gather the people. And that&rsquo;s                  what you need. We&rsquo;re going to have the power of numbers.                  That&rsquo;s what we want.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And I believe we&rsquo;re going to have it and it&rsquo;s                  already out there.</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Right. It&rsquo;s already out there.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a matter of focusing. </p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; And also then, the personal. It&rsquo;s                  both. It&rsquo;s the Earth and then some of us in pioneering                  work. Personally we&rsquo;re safer because then our work outlives                  us and there&rsquo;s no reason to&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And safety in numbers. Right?</p>                <p class="style7">BO&rsquo;L:&nbsp; Safety in numbers. Yes.                  I think so. I&rsquo;m                  optimistic that this can happen, that we really do have a positive                  future. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m on this planet. That&rsquo;s                  why I&rsquo;m alive, is to express that vision.</p>                <p class="style7">&nbsp;</p>                <p class="style7"><br>                  <span class="style7"><em><a href="brian_o_leary.html" target="_blank"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Click                  here</font></a></em> <font color="#990033" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong>for                  the                  </strong></em></font></span><font color="#990033" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong>original                  video</strong></em></font></p>                <p class="style7"> </p>                <div align="left">                  <blockquote>                    <p><font color="#FF9900" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="left"><strong>__________________________</strong></font></p>                  </blockquote>                </div>              </blockquote>            </blockquote>               <br><table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                          <!--DWLayoutTable-->                          <tr>                            <td width="350">                          <div align="center">                                  <table width="425" border="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                                    <tr>                                      <td bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>                                          <font color="#990033">Support Project Camelot - make a donation:</font></strong></em></font></p>                                    <div align="center"><a href="https://projectcamelotportal.com/donate.html"><img src="x-click-but21.gif" width="110" height="23" alt="Donate"></a>
