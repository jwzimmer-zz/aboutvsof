Will someone turn                  this on? </p>                <p class="style7">Before I begin, I would like to say a couple of words of deep                  appreciation for the sponsors and people who have put this                  program together. I have been involved in speaking publicly                  all over the planet and all over the United States. I have                  been to conferences here, I have been to conferences there,                  and I know how terribly difficult it can be to put a program                  like this together. </p>                <p class="style7">I have to say I have tremendous respect and admiration for                  the people who have done this. Most of all, I respect their                  courage for dealing with a subject like this where most of                  the elite leadership and the power groups of the world want                  this subject to go away. And these courageous young men who                  have put this together are brave and they deserve your respect                  and your admiration, and I want to say I thank you because                  I know what you&rsquo;ve been through. </p>                <p class="style7">[applause]<img src="bob_dean_barcelona.jpg" width="500" height="313" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></p>                <p class="style7">Now, I must explain something else to you. I never read from                  a script. I don&rsquo;t have a prepared script to follow. I                  get up on a stage and I talk to people like yourselves and                  I kind of wing it. </p>                <p class="style7">I have so much material and I have such a problem of keeping                  it under the allotted time that I&rsquo;ve been given. I have                  come today prepared to speak to you for three hours. I am only                  allowed one hour and fifteen minutes. So something is going                  to have to give. But bear with me, I&rsquo;ll do the damndest                  job I can. It&rsquo;s important that you see the photographs                  of the NASA pictures that I have brought with me.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, my journey began 45 years ago. I began a journey that,                  if I had known then what I know now, if I had known the pain,                  the anguish, the heartbreak that I was going to experience                  over these 45 years, I might not have started that journey                  at all. </p>                <p class="style7">But here I am in Barcelona in 2009 with some of the most delightful                  people I have ever met. And looking back, I find that the journey                  was worth the effort; it was worth the pain; it was worth the                  heartbreak. I&rsquo;m delighted to be here and I&rsquo;m delighted                  to see all of you out there. </p>                <p class="style7">This is such an encouragement to me that people are beginning                  to <em>demand</em> the truth. They know they have been lied                  to from the very beginning, and they want to know. And I&rsquo;m                  going to -- here, this afternoon, hopefully -- contribute one                  small measure to helping you understand and helping you know.</p>                <p class="style7">Most of my adult life, or most of the first                  part of my adult life, I was a professional soldier. I was                  in the army. I joined the army in 1950 to avoid the draft,                  ended up going to Officer&rsquo;s                  Candidate School (OCS); and, so help me God, while I was                  going to OCS at Fort Riley, Kansas, the North Koreans invaded                  South Korea. </p>                <p class="style7">The next thing I know I&rsquo;m on the front lines in Korea                  being shot at by a bunch of pissed-off Chinese and North Koreans                  who tried to kill me -- and I had nothing against them; I didn&rsquo;t                  want to kill them. Here I am, in 1951, leading combat troops                  in Korea in one of the bloodiest wars we have ever had, and                  the rest, I guess you could say, is history. </p>                <p class="style7">I led combat troops in Korea in 1951; I spent 27 years on                  active duty and I also was involved in the war of Southeast                  Asia in 1970, where I was part of an organization that gathered                  intelligence in the jungles of Southeast Asia: South Vietnam,                  Laos and Cambodia. Let me tell, you some of those years were                  rather harrowing.</p>                <p class="style7">The most harrowing experience I was to have was when I was                  assigned to Paris, France, in 1963, to what we considered in                  those days a plush assignment, a plumb assignment. I was able                  to go to Paris, France, take my family with me and my children                  went to high school in Paris and, as I said, this was a plumb                  assignment. I had no idea what I was to find when I got there. </p>                <p class="style7">When I arrived in the summer of 1963, I arrived with a Top                  Secret clearance. When I arrived at the Supreme Headquarters                  Allied Powers in Europe, which was located at that time in                  a small town known as Rocquencourt, right outside of Paris,                  my security clearance was upgraded to Cosmic Top Secret, which                  was then -- and still is today -- the highest level of security                  classification that NATO has. </p>                <p class="style7">I had to have a Cosmic Top Secret clearance to work in SHOC,                  Supreme Headquarters Operations Center: the war room. I was                  a Senior Master Sergeant at the time and, when I was assigned                  in SHOC, I was given the job of maintaining the Duty Roster.                  We worked on a 24-hour basis, day after day after day. And                  I was given the job of running the Duty Roster when I worked                  in SHOC. </p>                <p class="style7">Back in those days -- let me tell you, the war rooms were                  somewhat primitive. You&rsquo;ve seen pictures today; I&rsquo;m                  sure, of the control centers of the most major installations                  like S.A.C. [Strategic Air Command] in Colorado Springs. Everything                  is electronic. Everything is demonstrated on the wall extensions                  just like this mural that&rsquo;s up here. </p>                <p class="style7">Back in those days we had teletype; we had field telephones                  and, if we wanted something on display, we had to go up and                  take a pin and put it on a wall and show the controllers where                  this division was, where that Soviet regiment was and so on                  and so on; very primitive.</p>                <p class="style7">When I arrived in the summer in 1963, I heard rumors about                  a study that was underway. Now, it interested me instantly,                  because the study was about UFOs and I was intrigued by that                  possibility. I was curious about UFOs and had no idea then                  what they represented. But we used to discuss this in SHOC,                  in the war room, that something was underway. What was it about?                  What happened? </p>                <p class="style7">Well, it appears that on the morning of the 2nd of February                  1961, World War III almost began. It was involved in the flyover                  of large numbers of circular metallic craft, flying in formation,                  very obviously under intelligent control. They would fly out                  of the Soviet sector in the Warsaw Pact toward the U.S. in                  formation at a high rate of speed and at a very high altitude.                  They would turn north over the English Channel over the southern                  coast of England and then they would disappear off of NATO                  radar over the Norwegian Sea. </p>                <p class="style7">On that morning of the 2nd February 1961, World War III almost                  began. The Soviets went on red alert. The NATO forces went                  on red alert. Everybody was, you know &hellip; fingers on their                  triggers, thumbs poised above those red buttons. And World                  War III was just moments away. </p>                <p class="style7">Within 20 minutes, it was all over. The objects flew, turned                  north and disappeared off of radar. It was all over. After                  this event occurred, a British Air Marshal, by the name of                  Sir Thomas Pike, who was a Deputy Supreme Allied Commander                  in Europe at that time; he was the deputy to my boss, General                  Lyman Lemnitzer, an American Four-Star General who was known                  as <em>SACEUR</em>, Supreme Allied Commander of Europe. </p>                <p class="style7">Air Marshal Pike says: <em>I&rsquo;ve had enough of this. </em>These                  objects had been showing up regularly, from time to time. As                  I said, they almost triggered a war.Air Marshal Pike said: <em>We                  are going to come to terms and find out what the hell is going                  on here. I want to know. </em></p>                <p class="style7">So he began a study. He initiated a study in SHAPE [Supreme                  Headquarters Allied Powers Europe] headquarters that was to                  last for three years. They published it and issued it in the                  summer of 1964 while I was there working in the war room. They                  titled it <em>An Assessment: An Evaluation of a Possible Military                  Threat to Allied Forces in Europe. </em> </p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s all it had. Just a title head and front, couldn&rsquo;t                  learn very much about that: <em>An Assessment: An Evaluation                  of a Possible Military Threat to Allied Forces in Europe. </em></p>                <p class="style7">I was working in the war room one early morning around 2:00                  or 3:00 a.m. and, as I jokingly used to refer to it, the coffee                  was too black to drink. We read all the newspapers and magazines.                  Many of you have heard military life is about 99 percent boredom                  broken up with one percent of sheer terror. And that&rsquo;s                  the way it used to be and that&rsquo;s the way it probably                  is even today. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m sitting there nodding off, and this                  American Air Force Full Colonel looked at me and he says: <em>Wake                  up.</em></p>                <p class="style7">He went over to the vault. The vault at SHOC was a walk-in                  safe. You opened the door and walked in and we kept classified                  documents in there. The colonel went over to the vault, the                  file, and pulled out this document and threw it on my desk                  and he says: <em>Read that; that&rsquo;ll wake you up.</em></p>                <p class="style7">Ladies and gentlemen, my life changed. I opened                  the first page and I couldn&rsquo;t put it down. I read and                  read and read. And I read it every time I was on duty in the                  war room. I was shocked; I was stunned by the implications                  of what I read in that study. As I said, my life has never                  been ever quite the same. </p>                <p class="style7">The study, briefly -- and I have to briefly                  lay this out; I could talk for two hours about this -- but                  the study simply concluded this: <em>Is there                  a threat to Allied Forces in Europe? Apparently not.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">They concluded that the planet Earth and the human race had                  been under some kind of survey or observation going on for                  hundreds, if not thousands, of years. They concluded, in 1964,                  that there were at least four different groups coming here,                  observing us, surveying us, analyzing us, closely watching                  us, what we were up to, what we were doing. They concluded                  that it did not appear to be a military threat involved, because                  their repeated demonstrations of incredibly advanced technology                  demonstrated to us that, if they had been hostile or malevolent,                  there was absolutely nothing we could do. If they were evil                  in their intent and they were hostile toward us, it would have                  been over a long time ago.</p>                <p class="style7">So, the conclusion was there were four different groups involved.                  They have been coming here for a very, very long time. Apparently                  they were not malevolent or hostile. The question was: What                  the hell are they doing here? Why are they here and why are                  they interested in us? Well, we did not know in 1964 what their                  agenda or their motives were and I will tell you, honestly                  and frankly, that even today our authorities, our senior military,                  our national security people still don&rsquo;t totally grasp                  what their motives are, what their agendas are. </p>                <p class="style7">Well, this study in 1964 was simply a beginning for me. As                  I said, I was never really quite the same again. I jokingly                  say I&rsquo;m usually a normal human being. And, after I read                  that study and launched on my 45 years of research, I lost                  all aspects of normality. I will be frank and tell you that                  over the years of my study, and the material that I have learned                  and gathered has brought about in me a complete destruction                  of my old world view, my old world paradigms. </p>                <p class="style7">The world view that I held since I was a kid growing up --                  everything made sense, you know. I knew why I was here and                  I knew where I was going, what was taking place. After I spent                  45 years on this, it all collapsed around my knees. That was                  the destructive aspect of my personality. That was the part                  that changed me completely from the kind of human being that                  I had been before into the kind of human being I am today. </p>                <p class="style7">Ladies and gentlemen, I am totally alienated.                  [laughter] No pun intended. </p>                <p class="style7">I said in a couple of interviews and previews and such: I                  have had -- for many, many years -- a love-hate relationship                  with the human race. One moment I love you. The next minute                  I hate your guts. One minute I adore you for the potential                  and the beauty of your music and your literature and your art                  and the next minute I&rsquo;m saying: <em>To hell with all                  of you. Blow them up. Let them blow themselves up</em>. <em>Clean                  the planet off. Get rid of them. </em></p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s part of the struggle of having lost your old                  worldview when your whole paradigm collapses around your knees.                  So the man standing in front of you here today is literally                  a human wreck, as compared to what I used to be. But I feel                  pretty good about it. I lost all my old illusions. I opened                  my eyes and I saw the future. And I&rsquo;m very happy about                  what I see. </p>                <p class="style7">I have learned over the years from an infinite variety of                  sources here, there and everywhere. I didn&rsquo;t retire from                  the army until 1976 and I kept my Top Secret clearance up until                  that moment. After I retired, I went to work for the Federal                  Emergency Management Agency and worked another 14 years for                  the U.S. government, where I had a Top Secret clearance. </p>                <p class="style7">So I have a total of 41 years of federal service to the United                  States. But I&rsquo;ve heard things over the years that literally                  still today stun me and shock me. I&rsquo;ve learned that the                  human race is a hybrid race. I&rsquo;ve learned that we are                  not merely alone; we have never been alone. We have had an                  intimate interrelationship with advanced extraterrestrial intelligence                  from the beginning of our history. And let me tell you that                  that intimate interrelationship is still going on.</p>                <p class="style7">This one race, in particular, apparently reengineered us as                  a species about 200,000 years ago. What we are here today is                  what we call <em>homo sapien sapiens</em> -- you&rsquo;re an                  engineered creature. Your genetics have been manipulated. You&rsquo;re                  not the same as what you were and you are not the same as to                  what your children and grandchildren and great grandchildren                  will be in the next hundred years. </p>                <p class="style7">The human race is going through a transition. It&rsquo;s more                  than a transition. It&rsquo;s what I have learned to be a transcendent                  transformation into a new race, into a new future. And your                  descendants will be as different from what you are here today                  as what you are from the old Australopithecus happened to be                  many years ago. </p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s not something to be afraid of. It&rsquo;s something                  to look forward to. You&rsquo;re growing, you&rsquo;re developing                  and you&rsquo;re becoming a new race, a new species. Your grandchildren,                  your great-grandchildren and the descendents on in the next                  century or two have destiny in the stars. Don&rsquo;t you doubt                  that for a minute. </p>                <p class="style7">This species, this race, this troublesome bunch of monkeys,                  has a destiny in the stars and we are a part of this infinite                  universe filled with intelligent life. And we have been from                  the beginning but we are only now beginning to wake up and                  see it. Only now are we beginning to open our eyes and listen                  with our ears and look out there and say, <em>all right where                  have I been? What am I now? Where am I going? </em> </p>                <p class="style7">As I said, your destiny is in the stars. Your                  generations to come, your descendants, your grandchildren and                  your great-grandchildren will go out there and they will claim                  their rightful place. [applause] In a universe filled with                  intelligent life. Your place out there belongs to you. You                  have a right to that and you will claim it. </p>                <p class="style7">There is so much to talk about. I&rsquo;ve got some slides                  that I have to share with you. Would you gentlemen please put                  the first picture up on the screen? I&rsquo;m being assisted                  by some very wonderful people back behind the scenes. </p>                <p class="style7">I like to start with a shot like this. Pictures of this nature                  inspire me. It gives you a glimpse of the community you are                  a part of, a little glimpse of the stars out there, the nebulae.                  That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re from and that&rsquo;s where                  you&rsquo;re going home again to. That&rsquo;s where you belong.                  Next picture, please. </p>                <p class="style7">I love these; they&rsquo;re so beautiful. I have some of these                  on my wall at home. They inspire me. I look at them and I have                  the sense of recognition that I&rsquo;ve been there before                  and I know that I&rsquo;m going back. </p>                <p class="style7">But something happened in my country over the last few years                  that I am very, very troubled by. Just last week the United                  States celebrated the 40th anniversary of putting a man on                  the moon. They went through this whole whoop-dee-do of patting                  ourselves on the back. Gee, wasn&rsquo;t that neat. Armstrong,                  Aldrin, you know, Collins up there in orbit, on the moon. Aren&rsquo;t                  we great people, aren&rsquo;t we magnificent? Look what we                  did. </p>                <p class="style7">Well let me tell you about a couple of things they did that                  you may not have ever have heard about before. They took the                  few pictures they had; they had it all televised. Everybody                  -- Rock, Walter Cronkite and all of them were looking up. <em>Golly,                  gee, isn&rsquo;t this great, isn&rsquo;t this neat? We&rsquo;ve                  got a couple of guys on the moon</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">Ladies and gentlemen, my government, NASA,                  which many of us in the United States say stands for <em>Never                  A Straight Answer,</em> proceeded to erase 40 rolls of film                  of the Apollo Program -- the flight to the Moon, the flight                  around the Moon, the landings on the Moon, the walking of guys                  here and there. They erased, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, 40 rolls                  of film of those events. </p>                <p class="style7">Now we&rsquo;re talking about several thousand individual                  frames that were taken that the so-called authorities determined                  that you did not have a right to see. Oh, they were disruptive,                  socially unacceptable, politically unacceptable. I&rsquo;ve                  become furious. I&rsquo;m a retired Command Sergeant Major.                  I was never famous for having a lot of patience. </p>                <p class="style7">The idea, when I found out, that they had erased 40 rolls                  of film involving of several thousand individual shots about                  what really happened up there, I became so furious that, you                  know, I could have punched the director of NASA in the nose. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m not the easiest man. I like to tell people that,                  like Henry Higgins in <em>My Fair Lady,</em> I have the milk                  of human kindness by the quart in every vein, so I really am                  a gentle man. But I have the capability, the potential of being                  rather dangerous and violent. And these lies and these cover-ups                  that I have learned about firsthand over the years literally                  infuriate me. </p>                <p class="style7">And I hope it infuriates you, because these authorities, these <em>nit-wits</em> in                  high positions of power who are proceeding to spend all the                  money the American people make for their own use, their own                  private programs, and then lie through their teeth about what                  the truth really is.</p>                <p class="style7">Well, thanks to the idea that there were a few employees in                  NASA 40 years ago &ndash; even today there are some good people                  working there, decent people, honest people &ndash; I have                  some film that they preserved, that was not destroyed. </p>                <p class="style7">Gentlemen, put up the next picture for me.

They went                    into orbit around the moon, as many of you know. I&rsquo;m                    sure this is no secret. They went into orbit around the Moon                    and, while they were there in orbit around the Moon, a number                    of anomalous artifacts began showing up showing interest                    in them.

While looking out                    of their window of their little craft, this object flew by.                    There is the moon in the background, of course, below the                    object that flew by the window of that little craft that                    they were riding in. Neil took the Hasselblad camera that                    he had, put it up to the window and snapped this picture.                    Next picture, please.</p>                <p class="style7">Ah, <a href="https://projectcamelot.org/bob_dean_nasa_3.jpg" target="_blank">NASA                    Apollo 12, roll 51, negative 8653</a>, something like that.                    Now this is a good-sized object. This is several hundred                    feet in diameter that came up next to the Lander and flew                    along beside them for a time. The guys in the Apollo craft                    put their camera to the window and snapped the thing, and                    I&rsquo;ve always jokingly said there were guys inside of                    this, taking pictures of the NASA craft. We were photographing                    them; they were photographing us.

This is the Lansberg                    crater on the moon. The guys in orbit above the Moon were                    particularly fascinated by Lansberg. They had been given                    a special assignment to take pictures of Lansberg, because                    the crater, which they designated as the Lansberg, had things                    going on in the crater that were very anomalous. There was                    construction going on. There were enormous facilities in                    the crater up there. </p>                <p class="style7">So they were specifically designated and assigned to photograph                  Lansberg to see if they could figure out what the hell was                  going on down there in the crater on Lansberg. While they were                  looking at Lansberg, this object happened to express interest                  in them and flew by. Now this line is an artificial line that                  was drawn to show you the &hellip; it gave the direction that                  this object was going.

Next picture.</p>                <p class="style7">Ah, now we&rsquo;re getting into some nitty-gritty. I want                  to give you just a brief little bit of history here. Back in                  the early days of NASA and the Apollo programs, I got this                  picture from the Japanese space agency, the Japanese NASA.                  They have a tremendous program going over there in Japan. You                  know the Japanese are bright people. </p>                <p class="style7">The Japanese space agency signed a contract with NASA years                  and years ago, to buy copies of every picture NASA took during                  the Apollo Program. And I&rsquo;m sure the Japanese people                  paid a sizeable amount of money for this contract. And as the                  films were developed and the photos were made, they shipped                  them off to Japan and the Japanese had a tremendous reservoir                  of goods of regional NASA pictures. They bought them. They                  paid for them. So this photograph was released by the Japanese                  space agency; you can see the Japanese writing here. </p>                <p class="style7"><a href="https://projectcamelot.org/bob_dean_nasa_6.jpg" target="_blank">This                    was taken by Apollo 13</a>. Now, you&rsquo;re all familiar,                    I&rsquo;m sure, with Apollo 13. That was the aborted mission                    that was going to the moon to land and they had an accident                    on the way. They couldn&rsquo;t land. They damned well barely                    got back. </p>                <p class="style7">While they were on the way to the moon &ndash; here&rsquo;s                  the moon &ndash; a number of things began happening. Some strange                  objects were appearing outside the windows of the spacecraft                  so the guys grabbed their Hasselblad cameras and start taking                  pictures. </p>                <p class="style7">This photograph shows three different objects. This looks                  like a circular object with an enlarged dome on top. This is                  a smaller object with a circular kind of disc-shaped craft,                  but coming in from the right margin of this picture is this.                  Next picture, please.</p>                <p class="style7">Here we are. <a href="https://projectcamelot.org/bob_dean_nasa_7.jpg" target="_blank">This                    is a blowup of the positive in the photograph</a> and here                    is a blowup of the negative of this object here. Ladies and                    gentlemen, this particular object is five miles long. I&rsquo;m                    tempted to use the term <em>big mother</em>. No pun intended                    because it appears to be a mother ship. It&rsquo;s gigantic,                    five miles long and here are these NASA guys are up there                    in this little cramped Apollo capsule, and they look out                    their window and they see something that is five miles long.                    It shakes them up a little bit. And when it got back to NASA,                    these pictures shook them up a hell of a lot. Next picture,                    please.</p>                <p class="style7">Ah, <a href="https://projectcamelot.org/bob_dean_nasa_8.jpg" target="_blank">this                    is the next sequence</a>. Here this large mother has moved                    into the middle of the frame and something else has come                    up over here, which has been estimated to be <em>two</em> miles                    long. But this really upset the guys. I have never been able                    to find out which one of the three Apollo members of the                    Apollo 13 group would admit to ever having taken these pictures. </p>                <p class="style7">So, as you know, the Apollo astronauts were threatened with                  their lives, I kid you not. They were threatened seriously.                  They even threatened their families if they ever divulged any                  of the information that they knew. Next photo, please.</p>                <p class="style7">Here we are. <a href="https://projectcamelot.org/bob_dean_nasa_9.jpg" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s                    the big mother</a>; here&rsquo;s the other one two miles                    long. Here&rsquo;s a picture of the positive; this is the                    negative. This mother is five miles long. Up here you can                    see what appear to be two circular objects, either arriving                    or departing from that particular big ship. </p>                <p class="style7">I can almost understand why the authorities in NASA, why the                  authorities in the space program didn&rsquo;t want this information                  to come out. They were frightened; they were stumped; they                  couldn&rsquo;t deal with it themselves and they figured, if                  they couldn&rsquo;t handle it, you couldn&rsquo;t handle it. </p>                <p class="style7">There would be social disruption; I believe is one of the                  terms they used. They would disturb the body politic; I believe                  the term they used. So they clamped the lid down on this and                  it is still down and it is going to stay down, I&rsquo;m afraid,                  for some time yet, until people like yourselves and me and                  the rest of the people here on this stage, by pushing and prodding                  and chipping away at this lie and the secrecy, until, eventually,                  we will succeed. And, don&rsquo;t you doubt that for a minute.</p>                <p class="style7">[applause]</p>                <p class="style7">Ah, now I&rsquo;m in for another photograph which I think                  will shock you some. In 1980, NASA -- <em>Never A Straight                  Answer --</em> launched the Voyager program to Saturn. They                  launched this little mechanical space ship filled with cameras,                  film and so on. They wanted to go to Saturn because something                  had been going on in the rings of Saturn, around the moons                  of Saturn that didn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense. Some anomalous                  events were taking place in Saturn, near Saturn, at Saturn. </p>                <p class="style7">So they launched the Voyager in 1980. The pictures                  they got back from Voyager was so stunning and so shocking                  that they just locked them up in a safe. Fortunately I met                  and developed a friendship with a retired NASA scientist by                  the name of Norman Bergrun. </p>                <p class="style7">Norman Bergrun worked for NASA for about 30                  years. He was a technician, a scientist on the Voyager Program                  to Saturn in 1980. Norman decided, after waiting a number of                  years for NASA and the authorities to be candid and honest                  and forthright and tell what they really found up at Saturn.                  And Norman got so frustrated he wrote a book. [Ed Note: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-makers-Saturn-Norman-R-Bergrun/dp/0946270333" target="_blank">The                  Ringmakers of Saturn</a>] </p>                <p class="style7">I think he couldn&rsquo;t publish in the United States; no                  American publisher would even touch it. Norman Bergrun had                  to go to Scotland, for God&rsquo;s sake, to Aberdeen, to get                  his book published. And he published it. He did succeed. He                  got his book. It&rsquo;s a piece of genius; it&rsquo;s a beautiful                  piece of work, and the things that they photographed near Saturn                  appeared in print for the first time.</p>                <p class="style7"><a href="https://projectcamelot.org/bob_dean_nasa_10.jpg" target="_blank">This                    is the A-ring of Saturn</a>. I think you&rsquo;re all familiar                    with what Saturn looks like; it&rsquo;s a beautiful planet.                    It&rsquo;s a giant, but it&rsquo;s got rings all around it.                    Well this is the A-ring and here&rsquo;s the object that                    is self-luminous, obviously artificial, larger than our moon,                    that seems to be moving all around throughout the rings of                    Saturn and among the moons of Saturn; and Saturn&rsquo;s                    got a couple dozen moons. </p>                <p class="style7">This object here, as I said, larger than our moon, moving                  all around apparently under intelligent control in the rings                  of Saturn. Now, try for a moment, if you can, to imagine the                  kind of a technology that is capable of constructing something                  larger than our moon, that&rsquo;s artificial, that moves around                  wherever it wishes to go that has probably got several thousand                  guys inside. That is shocking to some people. Next picture                 , please. </p>                <p class="style7">Ah, this is the <em>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</em>,                  I guess, as the French say. Here you have <a href="https://projectcamelot.org/bob_dean_nasa_11.jpg" target="_blank">another                  self-luminous, artificially constructed object</a>, circular                  in shape, larger than our moon that is <em>also</em> moving                  here, there and everywhere throughout the rings of Saturn and                  among the moons of Saturn. You know, there has to be intelligence                  aboard. </p>                <p class="style7">But this is the one that really blew the NASA people on the                  Voyager program out of the water. This object &ndash; this                  is an object guys &ndash; is 2000 miles long. It&rsquo;s 400                  miles in diameter, and it is an artificially constructed&hellip; Norman                  calls them an electromagnetic vehicle. He says they appear                  to be making the rings. This is one of the rings of Saturn;                  I think this is B-ring. Bergrun says he thought they were probably                  making the rings. I said: <em>Norman, you have to consider                  the possibility they may be mining the rings.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">I think the rings are probably rich in nutrients, in minerals                  probably, and an incredibly advanced civilization I think would                  work out some system of mining those rings for all the minerals                  up there and utilizing them because space is filled with wealth;                  energies of all kinds. They never have to dig another hole                  in the ground like we do down here. Space is filled with energy. </p>                <p class="style7">This is 2000 miles long and here on this end, there seems                  to be something like an exhaust or a flare of energy of some                  kind. It&rsquo;s probably the result of engines of some type                  inside this thing; but, whatever it&rsquo;s doing, it&rsquo;s                  there, and it&rsquo;s a recognition and representation of an                  advanced intelligence. </p>                <p class="style7">And that&rsquo;s one of the things that they don&rsquo;t want                  you to know -- that we are confronting and relating with an                  intelligence that&rsquo;s so far beyond our own; we&rsquo;re                  looking at and talking about what&rsquo;s known as a <em>Type                  II civilization. </em> </p>                <p class="style7">Now, for your own interest -- I suspect most of you suspect                  this -- but you are all members of a zero-zero-type civilization.                  Beyond us, hopefully in a century or two, we might become a                  Type I. But this is a representation of the Type II civilization.</p>                <p class="style7">Michio Kaku, the famous Japanese-American physicist in New                  York, has put out this concept about Type II, 0, I, II, III                  and IV of the kind of advanced cultures and civilizations we                  will probably meet out there. Well, <em>we&rsquo;ll probably                  meet out there</em>; we have already met them.

And, I think most of you are pretty bright                  people and you know you&rsquo;ve been conned. You know you                  have been lied to. You&rsquo;re not fools and I think you know                  who you are and why you&rsquo;re here and where you&rsquo;re                  going.</p>                <p class="style7">[applause] Next photograph, please.</p>                <p class="style7">Ah, this is a photograph taken by our Mariner space vehicle                  that we launched back a number of years ago. <a href="https://projectcamelot.org/bob_dean_nasa_12.jpg" target="_blank">This                  is a picture of a facility on the surface of Mars.</a> Now,                  this facility is located on the equator, and it&rsquo;s on                  the surface, and those of us who have studied it and discussed                  it with each other, call it <em>the airport</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">I said this is the parking lot (oval flat area). This is the                  administration building here (raised semi-circular area adjacent                  to the left of the oval); this is the main terminal here (structure                  directly behind the oval flat area), and I imagine it is a                  pretty busy facility, you know, with ships coming and going,                  but it&rsquo;s not an airport. </p>                <p class="style7">It is very likely a spaceport. It is on the surface and it&rsquo;s                  on the equator of Mars. And if you are ever interested in launching                  a vehicle from a planet, you put it on the equator and you                  take advantage of the rotation of the planet to assist in the                  launching of your vehicle. You can take the momentum of the                  movement of the planet and it helps you get the thing off the                  ground. So, it&rsquo;s exactly on the equator; it&rsquo;s on                  the surface and it&rsquo;s massive in size. </p>                <p class="style7">So maybe that is the parking lot; I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe                  that is the admin building, but there is something going on,                  on Mars, and I&rsquo;ve been going back and forth with Richard                  Hoagland now for years, where Richard, who I know most of you                  are aware of, is convinced that Mars is covered with ruins.                  Well it is. But it is not just ruins. There are things going                  on, on that planet; on the surface, under the surface, continually                  so.

This beautiful lady has                  a respiratory system, she has a circulatory system and she                  has a heart. </p>                <p class="style7">She is our source of life on this planet. We needed her. We                  need her now. We wouldn&rsquo;t be here if it were not for                  her. We talk about holy lands: Mecca, Jerusalem, here, there,                  everywhere. That is the holy land, people -- that beloved planet                  that we are on. Next picture, please.</p>                <p class="style7">I spoke to you earlier about the fact that your grandchildren,                  great-grandchildren and so on -- the generations yet to come                  -- have their destiny in the stars. And meantime, they will                  go out there and claim their rightful place in that infinite                  community of life. You can believe that and you can accept                  that with an assuredness and truth that goes beyond doubt. </p>                <p class="style7">The destiny of this species and this race, this troublesome                  clan of monkeys, is in the stars and there is your destiny.                  I want you to understand that and have some hope, and don&rsquo;t                  get depressed, because you are going to be undergoing some                  very difficult times in a few years left ahead. </p>                <p class="style7">We are going through this transition, this transformation,                  this transcendent transformation into another species, into                  another race. And, if you remember your own adolescence, it                  was a painful time. The species, the race, is going through                  adolescence, but we&rsquo;re not alone. We&rsquo;re getting                  helpers.</p>                <p class="style7">We have family out there that&rsquo;s helping us and they&rsquo;ve                  been helping us for a long time. They&rsquo;ve been trying                  to encourage us and nourish us and trying to point the right                  direction for us to go, because we are a troublesome adolescent                  children, and we are going through that transformation. But                  my point is that there is no doubt about the inevitable destiny                  and truth of the human race. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I want to quote something for you if you&rsquo;ll bear                  with me here. One of my favorite authors, poets, was a man                  I&rsquo;ve admired for years: Count Leo Tolstoy. Tolstoy said                  that there is something in the human spirit that will survive                  and will prevail. That will survive and prevail and there is                  a tiny brilliant light burning brightly in the heart of man                  that will not go out no matter how dark the world becomes. </p>                <p class="style7">And in the years ahead when things are difficult and economic                  problems take place, there will still be disruptions, fear,                  hope; sadly enough, I&rsquo;m afraid, there will still be blood                  in the streets, here, there, and everywhere. This coming out                  of adolescence is not an easy process. But then what do you                  do when you leap beyond adolescence? You reach adulthood. You                  grow up. And we&rsquo;re growing up. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, ladies and gentlemen, my journey is coming to an end,                  but for many of you out there your journey has just begun.                  And I want to show something to you before I leave the stage                  this afternoon. No matter how dark the world becomes, you can                  be sure, as Tolstoy said, there is a spark, there is a flame                  burning in your heart that will never go out no matter how                  dark the world becomes. </p>                <p class="style7">And as my journey is coming to a close, and                  for some of you your journey is just beginning, I wanted to                  say to you in a term that I think is absolutely appropriate &ndash; you                  Spaniards have got some beautiful terms in your words &ndash; <em>Vaya                  con Dios</em>.

He was also from somewhere else. He said, &ldquo;You                    also smell bad</em>. [laughter]<em> You humans stink. Nothing                    personal, mind you. We find that you don&rsquo;t smell good.&rdquo;</em></p>                <p class="style7">And the scientist said: <em>My first thought was, you know,                    I didn&rsquo;t spray under my arms this morning, maybe. </em></p>                <p class="style7">And they tried to explain that we humans have a psychic odor                  about us that they pick up and they find it terribly offensive.                  So it hit me between the eyes because, when I was a boy growing                  up, my grandmother used to say: <em>If we could only see ourselves                  as others see us.</em></p>                <p class="style7">It would help so much to develop our integrity and our character                  and all that, and this remark of my grandmother hit me that                  we were getting this so-called <em>from the horse&rsquo;s mouth</em> from                  one of our extended family out there that: <em>you&rsquo;re                  primitive, savage and dangerous, but you also stink.</em></p>                <p class="style7">I thought that was humorous and I shared that with Gogo and                  she said: <em>Please include that in your presentation.</em> So                  Gogo, bless your heart. I did that for you, you know. </p>                <p class="style7">Goodnight everybody. [applause]</p>                <p class="style7">HD:&nbsp; One sentence. It relates directly to what Bob has                  said. If you want contact, raise your spirit high. That&rsquo;s                  what they want because they don&rsquo;t want to mix with you                  if you&rsquo;re savage beasts. It&rsquo;s that simple.

[laughter] I must add this.                  I have traveled all over the planet and I have spoken to conferences                  all over the world and all over the United States. I have never                  been to a conference of this nature without there being at                  least one, and generally two, of the <em>others</em> in the                  audience. </p>                <p class="style7">I want you all to think about that and look                  around you and know that in your midst... [laughter] you have                  good friends in high places, and they&rsquo;re                  in your midst, and I&rsquo;ve learned over the years to recognize                  them.</p>                <p class="style7">HD: It&rsquo;s your family.</p>                <p class="style7">BD: Exactly, they&rsquo;re family. But like Ingo Swann, I&rsquo;ve                  developed the intuitive ability to spot them and recognize                  them and now I have them coming up to me at conferences, introducing                  themselves to me. There are no limits. Life is infinite and                  forever. God bless all of you, and I will tell you goodbye                  this time.</p>                <p class="style7">[applause]</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <p class="style7"><span class="style7"><br>                    <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ngvIP0Za9M" target="_blank">Click                  here</a></em> <font color="#990033"><em><strong>for the                  video</strong></em></font></span><br>                </p>                <p class="style7"> </p>                <div align="left">                  <blockquote>                    <p><font color="#FF9900" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="left"><strong>__________________________</strong></font></p>                  </blockquote>                </div>              </blockquote>            </blockquote>               <br><table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                          <!--DWLayoutTable-->                          <tr>                            <td width="350">                          <div align="center">                                  <table width="425" border="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                                    <tr>                                      <td bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>                                          <font color="#990033">Support Project Camelot - make a donation:</font></strong></em></font></p>                                    <div align="center"><a href="https://projectcamelotportal.com/donate.html"><img src="x-click-but21.gif" width="110" height="23" alt="Donate"></a>
