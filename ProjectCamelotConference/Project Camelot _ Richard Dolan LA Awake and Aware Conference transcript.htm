<br><br>
KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  Okay, Rich Dolan! How&rsquo;s it looking?
<br><br>

RICHARD
DOLAN (RD):  I think we&rsquo;re ready.
<br><br>

BILL
RYAN (BR):  You&rsquo;re ready to go?
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. We&rsquo;re going to tell everything we know about Rich Dolan,
because we kind of know him well. [laughs].

<br><br>

He&rsquo;s
such a political guy that he has his hand on the political pulse, and
he&rsquo;s got a brand-new book out. Bill has actually read it. I
haven&rsquo;t had time lately. I read his other book, though, and I
can tell you, he&rsquo;s a wonderful writer. <I>UFOs
and the National Security State</I>
&ndash; we&rsquo;ve been waiting for<I>ever</I>
for the second volume and finally it&rsquo;s out and apparently it&rsquo;s
absolutely phenomenal.

<br><br>

Rich
is just an amazing guy. Let&rsquo;s see, do we say Rhodes Scholar
finalist? Whatever. And historian; brilliant, brilliant mind; very
level-headed; politically-astute. He&rsquo;s also himself an
intuitive. He doesn&rsquo;t tell you that, but he is! And I&rsquo;ve
known him from before Camelot, so I have to say that I actually tried
to spur him on to more radicalism. [laughs]

<br><br>

I
know we have to move things along, Bill. Okay, Bill, why don&rsquo;t
you do the official introduction? I think I&rsquo;ve pushed around
enough dirt here.
<br><br>

BR:
 That was the unofficial one? Okay. The official introduction is very
brief. Twenty years ago I read Timothy Good&rsquo;s <I>Above
Top Secret, </I>which was
known by many in those days as <I>the
Bible of UFOlogy</I>. That&rsquo;s
the book which you give people who doubt the reality of the
phenomenon and then you say: <I>Okay,
read that and we&rsquo;ll talk again.</I>


<br><br>

Now
there&rsquo;s a new book that supersedes this in every way. And, as
Kerry was saying, it&rsquo;s not just one book, it&rsquo;s a trilogy,
and Rich has just published the second of three volumes, 638 pages.
It&rsquo;s the second volume which takes it from... is it &rsquo;78
to...?

<br><br>

RD:
 &rsquo;73 to &rsquo;91.
<br><br>

BR:
 &rsquo;73 to...?
<br><br>

RD:
 &rsquo;91.
<br><br>

BR:
 &rsquo;73 to &rsquo;91 &ndash; some very interesting years in
UFOlogy. And Volume 3 is from &rsquo;91 to the present.

<br><br>

Rich
has got no other role here than being an academic historian, with all
the combination of intellectual rigor and thinking outside the box.
He&rsquo;s surfing on the waves of history itself here, chronicling
these times which are unique in the history of the human race, we
believe. I believe that Richard believes this too, and he knows
probably more about this subject now than almost anybody else on the
outside of the inside.

<br><br>

KC:
 On the outside of the National Security State.

<br><br>

BR:
 I'm not going to say anymore. Richard, take it away and tell them
everything you know. You&rsquo;ve got one hour.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.

<br><br>

RD:
 Thanks very much. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here. I&rsquo;d like
to thank Bill and Kerry for that very gracious introduction and other
people here at Camelot, who&rsquo;ve made my trip here a lot easier
and more pleasant. I thank them, also.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
already enjoyed meeting a number of attendees here. As I&rsquo;ve
often felt that &ndash; I absolutely mean this &ndash; I learn more
at the conferences, I think, than you do from me. The reason is that
there is never a lack of brilliant people who know an awful lot about
this, and they typically will come up to me; some of them will come
up to me during the conference, and proceed to tell me these
incredible things. So, it&rsquo;s always worthwhile for me to come
here, and I also just enjoy meeting people.

<br><br>


I do have a new book out. It&rsquo;s
the second volume of <I>UFOs
and the National Security State</I>.
I do have some copies here. I hope I brought enough, but the book is
easily available now at my website [ <U><A HREF="https://www.keyholepublishing.com/" target="_blank">www.keyholepublishing.com</A></U>
] and on <U><A HREF="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</A></U>,
and I will be talking a little bit about that.

<br><br>

For
my quarry today I have titled my lecture <I>Exopolitics
in a New Key: Creating a Fresh Roadmap</I>.
I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a bit ostentatious or not. I wrote
it on the plane on the way out here, so, literally, it&rsquo;s a
brand new lecture.

<br><br>

So
let&rsquo;s begin. I&rsquo;ve got three basic themes that I want to
cover today. First, I do want to talk a little bit about my book, not
to market it, but, really, because it&rsquo;s relevant toward the
later theme that I want to discuss today.
<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
developed some thoughts over the last several years about
Exopolitics. I&rsquo;ve never written explicitly about Exopolitics,
but, for various reasons, I am often asked to comment on Exopolitics.


<br><br>

I
have, for example, spoken at every one of the Steven Bassett&rsquo;s
<I>X-Conferences</I>.
In fact, I think I&rsquo;m the only person who&rsquo;s spoken at all
of them, and I&rsquo;ve attended and spoken at all of the National
Press Club events that he&rsquo;s had. So, that&rsquo;s something of
an Exopolitical event and that&rsquo;s put me within that whole
discussion.
<br><br>

So,
I have some thoughts about Exopolitics, which I think are my own and
I&rsquo;d like to share those with you today. And I&rsquo;d like to
wrap it up, continuing along those lines, with my own thoughts on
where we are headed as a society, as a civilization -- indeed, as a
species. I think it all works together rather well. So, we&rsquo;re a
little bit behind schedule and I&rsquo;ll move right ahead.
<br><br>

My
new book is subtitled <I>The
Cover-up Exposed</I>. It took
me about five years to write this book. Actually it&rsquo;s
impossible for me to know because my first volume went through two
editions. The second edition came out in 2002 and people &ndash; back
then I was brand new in the field at the time &ndash; and people
said: <I>Oh, that&rsquo;s a
pretty good book. What about the rest of the story?</I>
[laughs]

<br><br>

And
I thought: <I>Yeah, I have to
do that, don&rsquo;t I?</I>
But then I wrote a lot of articles and I did various public speaking
venues, and so forth, and I estimate about five solid years of
working on this particular volume.
<br><br>

It
took a lot out of me in a lot of ways, to be perfectly candid with
you. It was a hard book to do, harder than the first volume I wrote.
I was lucky because, after that first book came out, a lot of people
came out of the woodwork and offered me their resources.

<br><br>

I
had one very, very dear friend of mine, an elderly gentleman who,
when he passed away, left me his entire immense library of nearly &ndash;
the shy side of 1,000 books, not to count numerous journals. An
enormous, enormous library collection which I actually read; I went
through all the journals.

<br><br>

You
have to understand. When I read these things, I&rsquo;m very
methodical, if you know me. So, when I read a book, I don&rsquo;t
just read it and say: <I>Oh
that&rsquo;s a good book.</I>
I have my notes and usually my word processor and I take notes all
the way through. Every little datum that I think is interesting goes
in the notes with the citation: <I>page
77 of this issue of this journal</I>,
whatever. And it goes in, so that I put them all together into an
enormous database.

<br><br>

My
UFO database is equal to, I think, about a 3,000 or 4,000-page book
and it&rsquo;s from that that actually I put all my narrative
together. So it comes from literally hundreds and hundreds of
different sources dealing with UFOlogy, but also dealing with
politics and geopolitics and para-politics and whatever else you want
to call it, and all other sundry weird things that strike my fancy,
and it all goes into my database.
<br><br>

So
then, when I come to year, say, 1977, I&rsquo;ll look at everything
from that year and it all comes together in a way that I would not
probably have otherwise thought to do. That&rsquo;s how I write my
books. It&rsquo;s not what they teach you in graduate school, but
that is what I do.
<br><br>

This
is a pretty big, fat book. It&rsquo;s a little over 600 pages. I&rsquo;ve
got lots and lots of end notes and index entries. In fact, the other
way to look at this is a series of a little over 200 specific
article-length sections that I&rsquo;ve tried to weave together. Each
subsection of this book, I think, can just be taken independently and
read as its own unit. So, if you had a particular interest in one
little thing, you could open the book and read that, but they all do
work together.
<br><br>

If
you are interested in more information about this, you can go to my
website which is <U><A HREF="https://www.keyholepublishing.com/" target="_blank">www.keyholepublishing.com</A></U>
&ndash; just like looking through a key hole, an image I&rsquo;ve
always enjoyed regarding this topic.

<br><br>

What
I tried to do in writing all books and all articles that I&rsquo;ve
done, and all public appearances that I&rsquo;ve ever done, is to try
to provide a reliable guide to our past -- our recent past, in
particular.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
long been my feeling that our past is somewhat unknown to us, and if
we&rsquo;re going to proceed as a responsible society, we have to
know our past.

<br><br>

Much
of our past exists in the form of official government documents and
archives. You may not know this, but in fact it is now widely
understood that the vast majority of U.S. government documents ever
created remain completely inaccessible to you and to me. They are
classified. In other words, a large &ndash; not a little, but a large
&ndash; majority of our own history is off limits to us. This isn&rsquo;t
just UFOs. This is everything.

<br><br>

We
are in a very, very difficult and dangerous state when the large
majority of our written documentary history is not available for us
to study. There is a very serious problem with that. So, what I&rsquo;ve
tried to do with the UFO topic is my part in salvaging our history.
Literally, that&rsquo;s how I look at it. I don&rsquo;t know how
complete it is, but it&rsquo;s as complete as I&rsquo;m able to make
it.

<br><br>

Toward
that end, I&rsquo;ve used the largest amount that I&rsquo;m able to
of government documents, that is, proven documents that you can&rsquo;t
make an argument against: journals, reliable journals or at least in
my opinion good journals, and that includes journals by UFO
investigative organizations doing on-the-spot investigations, a wide
range of such journals; various books, of course.

<br><br>

And
I&rsquo;ve done a lot of interviews for this particular book. I
actually don&rsquo;t know how many individuals I interviewed, maybe a
couple of dozen. Maybe 20 or 30 people directly involved in the
events that are in this book, I either met with in person, or did
extended telephone interviews, or conducted correspondence with, and
got their stories directly. And all of it, again, trying to weave
together as reliable an account as I can.

<br><br>

I
want to emphasize that everything in this book, with a couple of very
specific exceptions, is verifiable data. Now, there are some
exceptions.

<br><br>

Any
researcher, as I&rsquo;m sure you will understand, who&rsquo;s been
in this field long enough, is going to have individuals that come up
to them and say: <I>I
appreciate your work. I have this bit of information that I would
like to share with you. Here it is, but you have to promise that you
cannot give up my identity. I have a sensitive position, etcetera,
etcetera. </I>And that
happens; that&rsquo;s life. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that it has to be
that way, but there it is.
<br><br>

Now,
any time a researcher gets that information and then repeats it,
keeping the anonymity of the source, of course, it&rsquo;s a
difficult situation, because it puts you, the recipient of that
information, in an unequal position. This is something that I never,
ever believe in doing.

<br><br>

My
attitude as a writer and as a communicator is that we speak as
equals, so that anything that I know, you should be able to know as
well. That&rsquo;s how it should be. That&rsquo;s how good history,
that&rsquo;s how good science is done, so I try to go easy with that.


<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
sometimes distressed by some researchers in this field, and I&rsquo;m
not really going to name names. I&rsquo;m not interested in doing
that today, but there are people who really do this to excess, in my
opinion.

<br><br>

Maybe
they feel they have no choice; they feel that they have to get the
word out. But the problem is that when you do this, you&rsquo;re not
necessarily helping the public discourse on this. What you&rsquo;re
doing instead is creating a lot of uncertainty about it.

<br><br>

So,
we&rsquo;re in a difficult position. We have what we feel are certain
truths and realities that we want to communicate to the rest of the
world, which we feel is in the dark and asleep. I think that&rsquo;s
true.

<br><br>

But
we have to be aware of who we are speaking to when we engage in this
kind of conversation. We have to be as responsible about this as
we&rsquo;re able to be and not unduly place the public&rsquo;s trust
in what we have to say, but rather, as I&rsquo;ve been saying, the
public should be able, any time, to check and verify the things that
we say.
<br><br>

Okay,
enough said on that.
<br><br>

This
book really is, as I see it, three major themes that I tried to weave
together. The first theme is what we might call the encounters,
something of an encyclopedic account of this particular 18-year
period of UFO history.

<br><br>

So,
if you had an interest in the Travis Walton event, you could read
about it in my book and my hope would be that you would read the
best, most concise, most complete [and] great account of it in
roughly &ndash; I think about 10 pages I spent on Travis Walton &ndash;
that you would find anywhere; or on the Hudson Valley waves of UFO
sightings of The Eighties, ditto; or the
Hessdalen case in Norway; or the Bob Lazar
phenomenon in the late &lsquo;80s, or anything else that happened in
that period of time.

<br><br>

My
goal was that you could use this book as a reference and a reliable
guide and know what you needed to know, learn what you needed to
learn. So, that was the first, and that&rsquo;s a lot of the book.
<br><br>

The
second major theme, though, I guess would be the politics. Obviously
there&rsquo;s politics to this. So, what I tried to do, again, is
learn and analyze the primary military and intelligence community
documents that describe this -- not just those of the United States,
incidentally, but trying to gain the attitude of responsible agencies
from any and all nations that encountered this.

<br><br>

The
Soviet Union figures heavily in this book, as does to some extent
even China; the European nations most definitely, and other countries
as well: Australia, Africa [and] Middle East. They&rsquo;re all in
here.

<br><br>

And
to the extent possible I&rsquo;ve tried to weave their take on this
and their attitude in here -- attitudes of various Presidents, of all
the Presidents; Presidential policy that&rsquo;s relevant to the UFO
phenomenon. The man in the center, of course, is David Rockefeller.
[referring to overhead display] He&rsquo;s in the book. I&rsquo;ll
get into that a little more in just a few minutes.

<br><br>

The
third major theme or strand of this book would be the research. In a
sense this book is a history of UFOlogy, which is a fascinating
story. In fact, of all the things that I researched in doing this
book, there were times when I felt that this to me, was personally
the most interesting.

<br><br>

Back
in the old days when I was in my late teens and early 20s, I was
studying history and English literature. That was my dual major. My
focus in history back then was what is called <I>intellectual
history</I>. It&rsquo;s kind
of like the history of ideas.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
always been interested in that, and really it occurred to me in
writing this volume that the story of UFOlogy is a part of
intellectual history, without a doubt, and this is a story that I
feel, in reviewing the literature, really hadn&rsquo;t been done in a
synthesized, coherent way.

<br><br>

I
think this book is actually a first true history of UFOlogy. We&rsquo;ll
come to that again in a moment.
<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
a backdrop involved in this book and it&rsquo;s one of global
transformation. You have, for example, geopolitical transformation,
the breaking up of the Soviet Union by 1991 at the end of this
volume. You have the birth of personal computing and even the
Internet before the end of this particular period. And you have
throughout &ndash; I tried to look at what we might call advanced,
either open or covert, cutting-edge technologies. The image on the
top there
[referring to overhead display] is the
famous ARV &ndash; Alien Reproduction Vehicle.

<br><br>

I
think I saw
Gordon Novel here in
the audience; Gordon, hello, if you&rsquo;re there.
<br><br>

So,
in other words, there are things in the larger world at large that
affected this story, and again, I tried to pay as close attention to
them as I could. So, I just wanted to expand a little bit on each of
those three themes and then move on to the next part of this talk.
<br><br>

The
encounters: The thing that strikes me when I reviewed the cases
involved, the UFO encounters that took place, is the <I>quantity</I>
of well-documented, just astonishing, mind-blowing encounters that
took place --military cases galore; hundreds and hundreds of them.

<br><br>

I
was fortunate in getting access to a database provided to me by the
researcher and former Aerojet
employee, Ron Regehr.
Ron worked on&hellip; he was involved in building what was called the
DSP satellite. That&rsquo;s Defense Support Program satellites. A
very interesting kind of satellite in which Ron argued, I think with
a lot of persuasion, that they are designed perfectly to be
UFO-spotting devices.

<br><br>

In
any case, Ron was able &ndash; accidentally, but legally -- to obtain
a list of DSP tracks of <I>Fast
Walkers</I> during this
period of time; in other words, <I>Fast
Walker</I> being the code
word for UFO in the upper atmosphere in space.

<br><br>

There
were... I&rsquo;m trying to recall... from 1973 to 1991 about 283, I
think that&rsquo;s right, <I>Fast
Walker</I> trackings by the
DSP satellites during that period of time. It&rsquo;s like one every
month or more, 15 a year, I believe. A couple of them were <I>really</I>
interesting, one in which an object came in from space and did a
U-turn in the vicinity of one of the satellites.

<br><br>

There
was also a DSP tracking of a UFO during the spectacular 1976 Iranian
jet fighter intercept. Many people are familiar with this and I,
again, cover this at length in my book.

<br><br>

To
make a long story short, in September 1976, over the city of Teheran
&ndash;  and, of course, this is back in the days of the Shah when
Iran was an ally of the United States &ndash; a large number of
Teheran citizens saw this very unusual object in the evening sky.
They called the local airport.

<br><br>

The
air traffic controller person at first thought it was silly, then he
went out and looked [laughs] and saw exactly what people were
reporting, and he called the Iranian Air Force. They sent two F-4
fighter jet interceptors in succession, and we know all about this
because &ndash; we know a lot about it because &ndash; we have a very
extended defense intelligence agency memo describing this in
fascinating detail.

<br><br>

What
happened is that in each case of the F-4 encounters, when they got to
within a range of 25 nautical miles of this object &ndash; which they
tracked on airborne radar, which they saw visually, which astonished
the pilots, each of them &ndash; when they got to within 25 nautical
miles, their key electronic systems went offline. In one case, right
before one pilot was about to fire a missile at this object. It
disabled the missile system.

<br><br>

It
so happens that we have DSP tracking data of a <I>Fast
Walker</I> in exactly that
spot at that time -- pretty interesting confirmation, indeed.
<br><br>

Back
to the quantity of these encounters, and what we find is just an
enormous amount of unexplained events going on that any responsible
researcher would have to inquire about. Forget the issue, initially,
of aliens.

<br><br>

The
biggest frustration I have when I talk to skeptics about this is that
they jump ten steps ahead of the argument and they&rsquo;ll say
something like: <I>Well
that&rsquo;s impossible because it&rsquo;s impossible for aliens to
come here from another planet. Don&rsquo;t you know anything about
astrophysics, o</I><I>r space
travel, or the impossibility... </I>

<br><br>

Well,
okay. I can&rsquo;t argue that and I know as well as the next person
that we don&rsquo;t have a way, ourselves, of getting to the nearest
star; not officially.

<br><br>

But
nevertheless, the real issue is in looking at these UFO reports and
then trying to make sense out of them. Sure, it&rsquo;s easy to just
say it&rsquo;s impossible, but the question is: <I>What</I>
<I>do you do with the
reports</I>? What most people
do is they ignore them, of course. That&rsquo;s the easy thing.

<br><br>

A
number of other very interesting developments during these years...
Abductions: I actually write quite a bit about that phenomenon, and
again, I&rsquo;m going to come back to that shortly.

<br><br>

The
mutilation phenomenon: <I>Is
that or is that not related to the UFO phenomenon?</I>
I think it is. Crop circles, ditto. I think that there&rsquo;s a
relationship there, and all of these I tried to deal with as well as
I could.
<br><br>

So
concluding, provisionally, regarding the encounter thread of this
book, there&rsquo;s a lot of conclusions we can make. Let&rsquo;s
keep it simple: <I>There is
an overwhelming evidence for UFO reality. </I>

<br><br>

To
me, if I were to have the opportunity to speak to somebody on NBC or
some major network, this is the message I think that I would
emphasize &ndash; that let&rsquo;s take one step at a time here, and
the evidence is overwhelming. This was my first primary goal in
putting this book together, was to lay that evidence out as
persuasively as I could.

<br><br>

The
politics: I&rsquo;m going to expand a little bit on this. Let me just
jump, put all of these out there and we can talk about them. There&rsquo;re
a lot of themes in my book that deal with what we would call the
politics of UFOs. Each of the presidential administrations, I tried
to deal with, I did deal with.

<br><br>

1973:
We had Richard Nixon still in the White House. There&rsquo;s some
pretty good Nixon UFO &ndash; there&rsquo;s one <I>great</I>
Nixon UFO story. That&rsquo;s the Nixon / Jackie Gleason story and
that&rsquo;s in my book.

<br><br>

Jimmy
Carter and the whole... oh, skipping Gerald Ford through Carter,
through the Reagan and Bush years -- it turns out that each of these
Presidents has some fascinating connections to UFO history. So that&rsquo;s
one aspect of it.

<br><br>

Then
the military/ intelligence-community-confirmed documents inform a lot
of this book as well. One thing that is very clear from looking at
the mass of that data is not simply that the phenomenon is real, but
that they were very, very concerned about this phenomenon. [laughs]

<br><br>

It
makes perfect sense when you&rsquo;re in charge of managing security
over an Air Force base and an object that you can&rsquo;t identify is
coming over your base, doing things that are not supposed to be
possible.

<br><br>

For
example, in the wave of airspace violations in 1975 along the
northern US border into Canada, over many bases with the Strategic
Air Command, triggering maximum-level alerts, sirens going, lights
flashing and all of that, with objects hovering 500 feet over weapons
storage facilities.

<br><br>

Yes,
it happened and it happened multiple times during a brief period in
late 1975. And we know for sure that this excited the concern of
responsible agencies. We learned about this because we were at a very
unique stage in American history in the late &lsquo;70s, and that was
when the Freedom of Information Act was actually kind of, sort of,
useful.

<br><br>

Back
in those days &ndash; this was the early Carter years &ndash; Jimmy
Carter had a very liberal attitude about FOIA and did promote a
relative amount of openness in relation to these government
documents.

<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
still a great deal that was never released and, in fact, of all the
Freedom of Information Act documents we have, almost none of them
were of the level of Top Secret or above. The highest good ones we
have are classified Secret and below. There&rsquo;s a couple of
documents we have that were Top Secret, and they were all excised,
blacked out or whited out, so you really can&rsquo;t read what&rsquo;s
in them.

<br><br>

But
nevertheless, a lot of good information came out and during that
period we learned about these airspace violations in the mid &rsquo;70s.
<br><br>

During
the late &rsquo;70s, early &rsquo;80s, there&rsquo;s overwhelming
evidence to show that intelligence groups infiltrated UFO research
organizations. They clearly did this earlier, as well, but my
argument in this book is that circa 1979, 1980, there is an active
effort by agencies once again to infiltrate the field, and to stir up
the mud and make it essentially a lot more difficult for us to know
what direction is up and what is down.
<br><br>

But
there&rsquo;s more than this. One of the things that I brought into
this volume that I really did not do a lot of in my first book,
because I don&rsquo;t think I was there mentally myself ten years
ago, is what I would now call the larger geopolitical realities.
<br><br>

Forget
UFOs for a moment. I think that most people can now recognize that
the United States President is probably not the guy in charge of the
country. Okay. So we all know this. So then the question becomes:
<I>Well, who or what is</I>?
And that&rsquo;s a harder question sometimes to answer.

<br><br>

Certainly
this is not a question that I see getting raised in the standard
halls of academia. I don&rsquo;t see this raised in political science
departments or history departments around the country or beyond. I
think that they&rsquo;re still stuck in a much more conventional
mindset.

<br><br>

But
the fact is, what I try to do is analyze each of the Presidencies and
their relationship to the elite organizations &ndash; the infamous
Bilderberg group, CFR, Trilateral, and so forth. Is there a
relationship? Well, the answer is absolutely, 100% <I>yes</I>.
Absolutely, yes. Not <I>maybe,
</I>but <I>yes</I>
&ndash; and this is important.

<br><br>

The
kingmaker of the United States for the past half century easily has
been David Rockefeller. You don&rsquo;t get to be President until he
says you are going to be President.



Gerald
Ford was a five-time Bilderberg attendee back in The Sixties. He
didn&rsquo;t just come out of nowhere to become the first unelected
President in American history.

<br><br>

Jimmy
Carter is probably, as most people in this room know, was lifted
almost directly by David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski and
dropped into the White House. That&rsquo;s really the case.
[laughter] I mean, Jimmy Carter interviewed with them before he got
the Democratic Nomination. They were impressed by him; they said:
<I>Yes, you&rsquo;re going to
be our man.</I>

<br><br>

Brzezinski,
of course, became his National Security Adviser, and he&rsquo;s now,
of course, one of the key advisers and point-men for Barack Obama.
Some things never change.
<br><br>

The
influence of the Trilateral Commission in the Carter administration
was actually much commented on at the time, and 1980 presidential
candidate Ronald Reagan made a lot of political capital out of this
fact.

<br><br>

Ronald
Reagan, in 1980, sounded a lot like Ron Paul did last year, believe
it or not -- he really did. Ronald Reagan campaigned in 1980 against
the elites, campaigned against the Council on Foreign Relations,
campaigned against George Herbert Walker Bush in that regard and said
in fact: <I>That man will
never be part of my administration.</I>


<br><br>

Well,
it so happened that Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s campaign manager was one
William Casey, a key leading CFR man and a close friend of the
Rockefellers, and all of that changed, obviously, when Ronald Reagan
selected Bush as his running mate, causing a number of long-time
Reagan supporters to walk off the stage at the Republican Nomination,
in fact.

<br><br>

A
month or two after that, in September of 1980, Ronald Reagan had a
pre-victory campaign party, September of &rsquo;80, and seated to his
right was David Rockefeller himself. So, that&rsquo;s how it all
works.
<br><br>

I
have some points, even, that I make on the assassination attempt of
Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr., son of John Hinckley Sr., who was
a very close friend of George Herbert Walker Bush -- a <I>very</I>
close friend.

<br><br>

Hinckley&rsquo;s
older brother, Scott Hinckley, that night, the night of the
assassination attempt, was due to have lunch with Neil
Bush, son of the Vice
President -- very interesting indeed, a confluence that major media
really did not delve into at all.
<br><br>

Okay.
Moving ahead, then, to other themes... Well, before I leave this,
I&rsquo;ll just then say that the United States Presidency, as I
argue, that the U.S. President, let me put it this way, is
essentially a sales rep and his job is to sell you, really, two
things these days.

<br><br>

The
first thing that he&rsquo;s got to sell you is globalization, which
is a bitter pill for many Americans to swallow, so he&rsquo;s got to
be good at that.

<br><br>

And
then the other pill he&rsquo;s got to make you swallow is whatever
new war comes down the pike, and they do this on behalf of
international financial groups.

<br><br>

One
of the other things that I will mention before moving on is that I
did a brief, but I think concise, analysis of the Gulf War. It&rsquo;s
not a UFO event <I>per se</I>,
but it&rsquo;s important. It&rsquo;s important in order for all of us
to remind ourselves that we need to take the veil away and see our
power structure for what it is, and the reason is that if we are
interested in what we call disclosure and openness from our
government, then we need to know exactly what that government is.

<br><br>

We
can&rsquo;t go through our lives rerunning our 5th grade civics class
version of the government in our mind. You know that version: You
vote for your member of congress &ndash; this was all on <I>Schoolhouse
Rock</I>, if you lived
through that &ndash; your member of congress, and then how a bill
becomes a law, and checks and balances, let&rsquo;s not forget that,
and on and on and on.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
really not our world anymore. We&rsquo;re in a different world and we
need to understand the true structure of power as it exists. So, this
is an important part of what I try to do in this book.
<br><br>

The
other aspect, we&rsquo;ll loosely call it under politics, would be
the technological considerations. Again, asking a question which I
don&rsquo;t have a complete answer to this: <I>the
ours versus theirs issue</I>,
so if you see a UFO -- <I>who
made it? Did we make it? Did they make it?</I>


<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
a hard issue always to resolve, at least in my own view. I try to
look at this by understanding what was the state of our official
technological achievements at certain periods in the history of this?
What were the possible states of achievement in the black world
[i.e., black ops], in the covert world, in trying to piece this
together.
<br><br>

Black
budget matters and privatization of the secrets also figure into my
book. What is the black budget? Well I think you all know. It&rsquo;s
not just classified federal spending, though.

<br><br>

I
think there&rsquo;s a lot more that goes into what we call the black
budget. I think there&rsquo;s a great deal of what we would all call
<I>illegal money</I>
going into black budget, into what we would call <I>Special
Access Programs</I> or <I>Waived</I>
Special Access Programs or <I>Unacknowledged</I>
Special Access Programs. There&rsquo;s actually a whole host of other
program names that I&rsquo;ve come across in my research.

<br><br>

They
have little to no &ndash; let&rsquo;s say <I>no</I>
&ndash; oversight by congress. They have little to no oversight,
sometimes, by their own agencies, whether it&rsquo;s the Navy, Army,
or Air Force, or any of the intelligence groups. Who knows who runs
some of these things?

<br><br>

It
appears that there&rsquo;s a lot of illegal money flowing through,
whether that&rsquo;s narco-trafficking dollars or securities fraud,
stock market fraud, you know, flowing through our government like the
blood in your veins.

<br><br>

And
by privatization of the secrets, what I mean is... again, forgetting
UFOs for the moment; I think it&rsquo;s not hard for all of us to see
how government agencies &ndash; and this is not simply the U.S. &ndash;
have become completely dominated by private money. I think we can see
this. And so, it&rsquo;s also the case with the UFO secrets.

<br><br>

One
of the points that I make &ndash; and some of this, not all of it,
does come from a couple of sources that, unfortunately, I&rsquo;m
just not at liberty to say who these people are &ndash; but I&rsquo;ve
been given information that I think is valid. It indicates a massive
runaway nature of the UFO secrets in the hands of private,
semi-public, but often very private interest groups.

<br><br>

Certainly
when you look at the Special Access Program &ndash; that whole world
&ndash; the few studies that have been done on it do indicate that
private contractors are the dominant partner, rather than DOD
personnel, who function for their part primarily as gatekeepers for
money to flow in. But the actual decisions are run by, whether it&rsquo;s
Boeing or Lockheed or SAIC or Raytheon or whoever is running the
programs, they&rsquo;re the dominant ones.

<br><br>

And
it makes sense because -- think about it: If you&rsquo;re a Pentagon
Four-Star General, when you retire, who&rsquo;s going to hire you?
Well, those companies will, at a nice cushy job making a lot of
money; and all this <I>revolving
door</I> that goes on.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
also very much easier for keeping the secrets when you privatize
this, because the information then doesn&rsquo;t become classified --
it becomes proprietary, which is a much, much better way to keep this
information from the public, and it becomes profitable, of course.

<br><br>

If
you assume, as I do, as I&rsquo;ve come to believe, that much of this
involves retrieval of acquired technologies, exotic technology not
manufactured by human hands, so then you&rsquo;ve got this little
artifact that you&rsquo;ve got to study and you may not be able to
duplicate it right away, but you might after ten years come up with
some pretty nifty ideas on what you can do, and you&rsquo;ve got a
great money-maker there.
<br><br>

So
really, the incentive for giving the secrets up becomes less and less
and less over the years. So, it naturally becomes private. Of course
it does.
<br><br>

So,
the obvious conclusion &ndash; this is the kindergarten-level
conclusion of the politics portions &ndash; is that there is an
active international cover-up of the core of the UFO phenomenon.
There&rsquo;s obviously much more that I try to say regarding that.



But
again, if there&rsquo;s a single take-away message, that would have
to be it: <I>It&rsquo;s a
real phenomenon and yes, Virginia, there is a cover-up.</I>
<br><br>

The
research... I&rsquo;ll get a little bit more into this. As I say,
it&rsquo;s a history of UFOlogy, a fascinating bit of history. It's,
in a sense, you might say that the history&rsquo;s a part of the
history of the development of human consciousness.

<br><br>

Think
of it this way: We&rsquo;ve had this phenomenon that&rsquo;s observed
us for who knows how long, right? And it&rsquo;s really during, I
believe, The Seventies and then The Eighties when researchers, in a
sophisticated way, tried to understand who these other beings were.
It&rsquo;s our attempt, in a sense, to turn the tables and understand
who they were.

<br><br>

Sure,
there were researchers in The Fifties and Sixties. I don't really
think that researchers in The Fifties and Sixties were quite there in
asking the kinds of questions that came up in The Seventies.
<br><br>

Something
of an intellectual revolution in UFO research took place during these
years. A lot of new issues came up that hadn&rsquo;t existed before.
The whole concept of crash retrievals became big; there was a lot of
resistance to it. It&rsquo;s a story, again, that I document, the
story of those people who tried to bring this issue to the fore and
those who said: <I>No, that&rsquo;s
a lot of nonsense.</I>

<br><br>

It
was a very heated issue &ndash; it still is, to a lesser extent. In
The Seventies and Eighties, it was a big issue; people got very upset
over it [and] the topic of abductions, probably more so.

<br><br>

Yes,
it had been known that there were probably isolated cases of what
appeared to be abductions by aliens. Everyone knew about the Barney
and Betty Hill case of 1961 and a few others. But, the idea back then
was: <I>Well, don&rsquo;t be
in the wrong place at the wrong time because if they see you, they
may just take you.</I>
<br><br>

What
happened during The Eighties was a completely different understanding
of that phenomenon. People like Budd Hopkins, foremost among them,
argued: <I>No, no, that&rsquo;s
not how it is at all. This phenomenon appears to be very widespread,
based on my investigations, and seems even to run in families. People
are repeatedly experiencing this phenomenon.</I>


<br><br>

In
other words, a kind of way of looking at it that, again, met a
tremendous amount of resistance at the time.
<br><br>

The
mutilation controversy really reared itself in a significant way
during this period. Again, there had been some cases of &lsquo;mutes&rsquo;
in The Sixties, but they didn&rsquo;t get a lot of attention until
the mid &rsquo;70s and they&rsquo;ve continued. Mutilation cases are
disturbing, fascinating.

<br><br>

Crop
circles, not so disturbing but equally fascinating, came up as a
major topic during this period of time.
<br><br>

The
other thing to say about the research is the effect of the Internet
on research. We all know how the Internet has changed the world, and
it certainly has. It also changed UFOlogy. What it really did is --
starting around 1987 -- it just caused UFOlogy to explode. That&rsquo;s
basically what happened.

<br><br>

Prior
to 1987, if you were an interested researcher in that topic, your
venues for expressing your ideas were very limited, basically. There
were some journals that were out there with a limited distribution.
You could try to create your own journal, which some people did, and
have an even more limited distribution. All the journals had their
own editorial policies for submission, of course. You had to be
careful what you wrote. And that was about it.
<br><br>

Starting
in 1986 and 1987, we get the very beginnings of what we now would
call the Internet. Back then there was no World Wide Web, but there
were newsgroups, bulletin boards, and, in fact, the earliest
non-computer-programming bulletin board was dedicated to UFOs.

<br><br>

The
UFO topic is one of the true pioneers of the Internet, and by 1987,
it allowed people in this field to publish their thoughts without
having to worry who was going to edit them &ndash; it just went out
there. And suddenly, they were getting more readers than those people
who&rsquo;d submitted their articles to the <I>MUFON
UFO Journal.</I>

<br><br>

Suddenly
the old guard of UFOlogy lost control over this domain. You could say
that&rsquo;s a good thing, you could say that&rsquo;s a bad thing,
but that&rsquo;s what happened, for better and for worse in fact,
because after that, a flood of information then came out. And again,
a fascinating story.

<br><br>

So,
that&rsquo;s the story of the research. And the conclusions of the
book, let&rsquo;s just say, roughly speaking: <I>The
phenomenon is undeniable; the cover-up is undeniable. </I>

<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
a confrontational nature to this phenomenon. There are many of them.
Militaries around the world have been chasing these things, not just
the American military. Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re
the bad guys or that we&rsquo;re the good guys &ndash; that&rsquo;s a
different issue. What it does mean, though, is that there is some
trouble in paradise. Someone&rsquo;s not getting along with someone
else -- that we can say.
<br><br>

Abductions:
 In my assessment of this, there is no question there is an abduction
phenomenon -- and it is NOT, as has been argued by some people,
mostly notably Dr. Steven Greer -- simply a military phenomenon. In
fact, I think it&rsquo;s irresponsible to make this argument. There
is something...[applause]  Yes, you can clap for that. [applause
continues]
<br><br>

It
boggles my mind, to be perfectly candid here, that a researcher can
make such a blanket statement. You have a phenomenon that&rsquo;s
gone on globally for a long time. You have individuals that are
describing highly consistent things in terms of their abduction
experiences, and I don&rsquo;t know what else it can be other than a
kind of religious-like zeal that can cause a person blindly to say
the only abductions that occur are military. This I find
indefensible, and I think that a careful review of the evidence
certainly leads to that conclusion.
<br><br>

Another
conclusion that I draw in this book is the runaway nature of the
black budget and, in a sense, what I&rsquo;ve come to call a
<I>Breakaway Civilization</I>.
What do I mean by that? Let me explain.
<br><br>

In
the course of human history, we&rsquo;ve had multiple civilizations
coexisting at the same time. Go back a thousand years &ndash; the
civilization of China was very different from the civilization of the
Near East or of Europe or of North or South America.

<br><br>

Over
the course of the last millennia, of course, these civilizations have
increasingly come to merge and to interact with each other. In a
sense, the story of our civilization is the coming together of these
various cultures and civilizations, and yet we have this history of
separate coexisting civilizations, so it&rsquo;s really not a new
concept.

<br><br>

Even
during the Cold War, certainly the scientific infrastructures of the
United States and the Soviet Union didn&rsquo;t share their
information with each other all that much, right? The Soviets had
this belief in the theories of a fellow named Trofim
Lysenko -- utterly
absurd biological theories, but the Soviet scientists held to this as
a part of state dogma through The Sixties. So my point here is that
we have examples of separate scientific infrastructures.

<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;m suggesting in this book is that what we call the <I>Black
World</I> &ndash; existing as
it does with, essentially, an infinite amount of money to play with,
for all intents and purposes, and an incredible amount of secrecy
within which to perform what they do -- really no oversight [of] what
would actually happen if after, as is inevitably the case, a couple
of brilliant genius Black World scientists stumbled across a new
scientific reality based on these technologies that they&rsquo;re
looking over? They come up with some really super-nifty ideas.

<br><br>

Would
they share it with the rest of us? We have this idea that there&rsquo;s
a spin-off technology involved, but is it necessarily so?
<br><br>

And
what happens &ndash; as always is the case with science, where one
breakthrough leads to another one, which leads to yet another one &ndash;
the next thing, before you know it, they&rsquo;re up here and the
rest of us are down here and that gap may in fact continue to
increase to the point where they have the ability to do things that
we would consider absolutely impossible.

<br><br>

They
would be so different that with justice we can call them a separate,
or what I call <I>Breakaway</I>
Civilization, with a completely different understanding of certain
scientific principles, and certainly a different world view, because
very likely, as I believe, they&rsquo;re interacting in a much more
up-close and personal way with &ldquo;them&rdquo; [points up] than we
are, so they have a different set of principles by which they live
their lives.

<br><br>

You
have to wonder how would they even be able to talk to us easily about
what they know? Just as if we were to be time travelers going back a
thousand years, how would we talk to people of any society of a
thousand years ago? How would be able to tell them the things that we
know? It might be difficult.

<br><br>

I
think that&rsquo;s something that we need to consider that&rsquo;s
already happened.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ll
do a little quick glimpse into my forthcoming book, Volume 3, which I
have tentatively subtitled <I>The
Fight for Disclosure,</I> and
it will cover the year 1992 to the present.

<br><br>

Really,
nearly all of my research for that is done. It&rsquo;s one reason it
took this book so long, is I ended up doing research for Volumes 2
and 3 all at once, so I think it'll be a lot less time for me to do
this book.

<br><br>

These
are just, off the top of my head on the plane flying here, my
thoughts on how this book is going to come together. The Internet
revolution, obviously... I don&rsquo;t think it needs to be again
said here. What also happened in The Nineties is an explosion of
reported UFO sightings. It&rsquo;s incredible.

<br><br>

Go
to the National UFO Reporting Center on the web run by Peter
Davenport, and you&rsquo;ll find [that] he catalogs about 5,000 UFO
sightings each year. Now, most of these don&rsquo;t get investigated,
clearly. They&rsquo;re what you&rsquo;d call raw reports, but they&rsquo;re
pretty interesting.

<br><br>

I,
myself, investigated two cases out of that database and I came away
feeling that both of those were legitimate. I&rsquo;m not saying all
of these cases are legitimate, but I think a lot of them probably
are.
<br><br>

The
fact is that in our own age, it&rsquo;s easier and easier now to
report this. There&rsquo;s no official government body that you can
report this to, which is a failure of our republic &ndash; very much
so &ndash; because, frankly, if you encounter what is the most
amazing thing you&rsquo;ve ever seen in your life, one would think
there should be an agency in your government that is charged with
dealing with it.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
why the government is supposed to be responsive to you, right? And
yet there isn&rsquo;t any. But yet, there are places on the Web and
it&rsquo;s easier and easier to report it, so there&rsquo;s an
enormous amount there.

<br><br>

There
has been the release not just of some legitimate documents. Really,
the glory age of freedom of information, I think, was in the late
&rsquo;70s, but what we&rsquo;ve had since then are continued
releases of official documents, but also the release of a lot of
disputed documents. These are the so-called <I>Majestic</I>
documents &ndash; you can read all of them at the website of
Ryan and Bob Wood [ <U><A HREF="https://www.majesticdocuments.com/" target="_blank">www.majesticdocuments.com</A></U>
].


<br><br>

I
think that a very good case can be made for the authenticity of many
of those documents; but, the point is that they&rsquo;re disputed.
What that means is they&rsquo;re of unknown provenance, and again, it
serves to muddy the waters of this field. I think it&rsquo;s
important that we continue to try to do research on those documents
to try to authenticate them or not.
<br><br>

There
have been a lot of initiatives in The Nineties and in our own century
toward Disclosure. I&rsquo;ll deal with the Rockefeller Initiative,
the whole Roswell GAO &ndash; General Accounting Office &ndash;
fiasco of the early &rsquo;90s under
the Clinton years.

<br><br>

The
efforts of Dr. Steven Greer in The Nineties leading up to his press
conference in 2001 are very important; the efforts of my friend,
Stephen Basset, I think figure into this equation; the Sci-Fi/ John
Podesta event of a
couple of years ago &ndash; all of these are important.

<br><br>

In
other words, what I think we&rsquo;re seeing is very much an increase
in the attempts now for citizen groups publicly to grab this issue
and make major statements about the need to end the cover-up &ndash;
much, much greater than had ever happened in the past; much, much
more so.

<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
also a very significant part &ndash; and this conference is obviously
a very strong reflection of this &ndash; is the growth of what we
might call <I>higher
consciousnesses attitudes</I>
within the UFO community. Back in The Eighties and Seventies, there
was a little bit of this. If you go back further to The Fifties,
certainly what we could call the <I>contactees</I>
would be considered sort of &ldquo;New Agey&rdquo; for their time,
without a doubt.

<br><br>

But
really, I think this is a different order of magnitude, what we&rsquo;ve
been experiencing through The Nineties. l think it&rsquo;s probably
connected with greater communication through avenues like the
Internet. Certainly, it&rsquo;s an important part of what&rsquo;s
going on, and it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ll need to deal with
in an appropriate way in my book.
<br><br>

The
other big thing, geopolitically, is the death of the nation-state,
the New World Order. Okay? This is probably the greatest
unremarked-upon -- at least in the mainstream -- event of our
lifetimes, at least geopolitically. Nations? I don&rsquo;t even know
what a nation is anymore. Do they even exist? If groups of people
[are] living with the same language in an area... is that a nation?

<br><br>

Who's
sovereign? Are you sovereign? Are we sovereign in our country? Well,
we are in theory and we must continue to fight for this. In reality,
our world has become something very different, and this has got to be
part of any study of the UFO realities in the last 20 years because,
again, we have to understand the true nature of the structure of
power.
<br><br>

<I>A
new Exopolitics</I>; well,
maybe that&rsquo;s an overly-dramatic statement. Look, any time we&rsquo;re
going to talk about Exopolitics &ndash; that is, the relationship of
us and them -- well, those are the two variables, <I>us</I>
and <I>them</I>,
and we have to have a clear understanding of both of these variables
to be able to talk intelligently about what we will call Exopolitics.
It&rsquo;s got to be done.
<br><br>

So,
through all of this, as well, it is essential &ndash; absolutely
essential &ndash; that we ask ourselves: <I>How
do we know what we know? What is our source of data? And who are we
saying this to?</I>
<br><br>

What
I mean here is that if we&rsquo;re going to be talking about other
entities in the galactic civilization, we&rsquo;d better damn-well
back up what we say with something other than: <I>I
got this through a remote-viewed bit of information or through direct
contact with an alien being.</I>


<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
very sorry. That&rsquo;s not enough. It may be enough in a private
conversation with other researchers, if that&rsquo;s what you
<I>believe</I>.
Everyone&rsquo;s entitled to have their beliefs; I speculate all the
time. But, we do ourselves a disservice as a community when we go
fast and loose with this kind of thing. We&rsquo;ve got to be more
disciplined with how we speak to the world.
<br><br>

How
would it be if, when you get an opportunity to say what we&rsquo;re
believing to a larger media organization, we go just off with this
and look ridiculous? We&rsquo;re not in a position where we really
can afford to do that. We have to be more careful.
<br><br>

We
can speculate, but we must distinguish between what we <I>know</I>
and what we <I>believe</I>.
They&rsquo;re not the same. It&rsquo;s not hard to do &ndash; it just
means qualifying one&rsquo;s statements a little bit, okay? I don&rsquo;t
think that&rsquo;s asking too much.

<br><br>

Let&rsquo;s
look at <I>us</I>
a little bit, let&rsquo;s understand who we are. What we&rsquo;ve had
is a situation where we&rsquo;ve been retrieving exotic technologies.
Now, there&rsquo;s a big statement by me, I grant. It is something
that I believe I back up sufficiently in my book. There has been a
great deal of information on this. Everyone knows about the Roswell
case, and there have been many others, frankly.

<br><br>

These
technologies &ndash; this is my hypothesis here, okay? &ndash; <I>have
to be kept secret.</I> You&rsquo;ve
got a cold war going on back in those days &ndash; <I>we
can&rsquo;t let the Russians see what we&rsquo;ve got &ndash;
</I>requiring secret
budgetary appropriations, i.e. the creation of a black budget.
<br><br>

The
UFO phenomenon is almost certainly the key factor in the creation of
the black budget world that we have today. Not the only one, but one
of the key motivators, I think.

<br><br>

Privatization...
I&rsquo;m just going to have to run through this... runaway
technological achievements: <I>This
is our secret infrastructure. That&rsquo;s part of us. </I>

<br><br>

Okay.
When most of us &ndash; I&rsquo;m excluding the present company here
&ndash; but I think most people go through our lives with the
assumption that we get our sources of information from, like, the
media; and that would include TV, but also Internet.

<br><br>

We
have a political system. We have an academic community in which there
is a back-and-forth kind of exchange there, so that they also are
responsive to us, in theory. The media, of course, we&rsquo;re told:
<I>Well, they give the public
what the public wants.  </I>

<br><br>

And
the academic world, of course, is supposed to be responsive to the
inherent value of truth and there&rsquo;s a back and forth there. The
political system&rsquo;s supposed to be responsive to us: <I>Throw
the bums out</I>, and so
forth.

<br><br>

How
is it really? Well this is how I think things have actually shaped
up. The arrow&rsquo;s going one way here. [referring to overhead
picture] It&rsquo;s going at <I>you</I>.
And it&rsquo;s not just media and the politics and the academics.
There&rsquo;s a <I>corporate
system</I> in place. This is
something that Exopolitical analysis doesn&rsquo;t fully <I>get</I>.


<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
great to talk about personal transformation, but we live in a world
of corporations and they don&rsquo;t give a crap about personal
transformation. They&rsquo;re driven by profit and shareholder value.
That&rsquo;s all they care about. They can be driven by beautiful
people who really do care about the world, but if they&rsquo;re not
increasing shareholder value, they&rsquo;re <I>gone</I>.


<br><br>

Corporations
have an iron law in which they <I>must</I>
increase shareholder value. That is their <I>raison
d&rsquo;etre</I>.
If they&rsquo;re not doing that, then the CEO is gone, which means
that they must behave in certain ways, and those certain ways,
unfortunately, are not typically designed to increase higher
consciousness among the people. They are, instead, designed to take
money out of your bank account. That&rsquo;s what they do!
<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
our world, and there&rsquo;s a great deal of interaction between
those major worlds, and there&rsquo;s other branches I probably could
have thought of if I had more time.
<br><br>

Under
a rubric, though, of an <I>elite</I>
&ndash; yes, there is an elite. I don&rsquo;t know what to call them
anymore. I used to call them the National Security State. Well,
they&rsquo;re not quite national.

<br><br>

They&rsquo;re
a little bit more than that, aren&rsquo;t they? International
Financial Maximum Security State... toss in Entertainment State. [Ed
comment: The &ldquo;elite&rdquo; are the <I>Supranational
Sovereignty of an Intellectual Elite and World Bankers</I>;
this term was coined by David Rockefeller in 1991, when he thanked a
gathering of the Bilderberg attendees for their dedicated efforts to
conceal and cover up the truth of who the elite really are.]
<br><br>

If
you looked at America as a room of 100 people, okay? And if there&rsquo;s
$100 in the room &ndash; assuming the dollar&rsquo;s still worth
something when we do this &ndash; one of those guys would own $40 to
$45 of those dollars. That&rsquo;s America. That&rsquo;s the world,
really. And then another guy would have another $11 bucks, and then
the last 80 people would have really nothing.

<br><br>

So,
that&rsquo;s the room that has a political system; it&rsquo;s got a
media, it&rsquo;s got all these things that make it go. It&rsquo;s
not hard, really, to figure out who&rsquo;s going to be in the best
position to manipulate all of these things for his own benefit.
Obviously, it's the guy with the $40, $45 bucks.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
our world. It&rsquo;s not complicated, and yet, of course, it&rsquo;s
never analyzed in this way in our mainstream media, precisely because
they&rsquo;re owned by that guy with the $45 bucks. [laughs] So, we
have to disabuse ourselves of the notion that we have a truly open
process in any way. We don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not.
<br><br>

And
this matters when we talk about UFO Disclosure, because doesn&rsquo;t
it matter, if you get Disclosure from your government, what the
nature of that government is? If it&rsquo;s a Republican system [i.e.
Constitutional Republic] that is responsive to you, that&lsquo;s one
thing, but what if it&rsquo;s a proto-crypto-post-modern fascist
state instead?

<br><br>

Well,
guess what? It is! We&rsquo;re not moving toward democracy, and by
the way, as I said earlier today, I don&rsquo;t think democracy is
bad. What I think is uninformed citizens of a democracy is a very,
very dangerous thing.

<br><br>

Are
we moving toward a world of slaves and slave owners? Yes, we are.
That&rsquo;s the direction. Escape into your own little private
Idaho, where you can play your video games and watch TV and zone out.
It&rsquo;s a lot more fun, frankly, than dealing with all the stuff
we have to deal with. If your house is on fire, but you&rsquo;re
having a really wicked-cool dream, who wants to wake up [laughs] and
deal with the crisis?
<br><br>

What
is our world moving toward? We&rsquo;ve decoded the human genome.
We&rsquo;re making amazing strides right now in the world of
nanotechnology, what will be called quantum computing, artificial
intelligence, creation of a super race? Maybe. Getting rid of
redundant people like us? There&rsquo;s that word... you hear that
word a lot these days: <I>redundant</I>.
Isn&rsquo;t that scary? It scares me. People are not <I>redundant</I>.
<br><br>

So,
we&rsquo;re in a post-modern dystopia. We&rsquo;re depleting our
resources -- we all know this; threatened cascading failure of the
global ecosystem [and] failing global infrastructures. Is there an
endgame scenario being discussed by those people in the know? Are
they planning something? Other people have discussed this earlier.
I&rsquo;m going to let you just ponder that one yourself.
<br><br>

Now
let&rsquo;s look at <I>them</I>.
Who are they? How can we learn about them? This should always be at
the forefront of our thinking.
<br><br>

Well,
we can learn a little bit about them through reviewing some of the
UFO sighting literature. There are many cases of people who have
described... I mean, seemingly honest, very, very low-key people have
said: <I>Yes, I had an
encounter with a being that... I don&rsquo;t think they were human.</I>
There&rsquo;s a lot of that and we can learn a lot from that.
<br><br>

Abduction
literature, yes, also, but let&rsquo;s be careful, and the only
reason I say that is because when people are taken, or seem to be
taken, it&rsquo;s not under the best of circumstances and there
certainly seems to be a lot of manipulation going on there.
<br><br>

Experiencers,
remote viewers, yes, but we have to be very careful. Let us not be
irresponsible. I&rsquo;ll leave it at that because I&rsquo;m running
short.
<br><br>

Who
are they? Here&rsquo;re a few factors about them: They operate by
stealth, at least usually. They don&rsquo;t seem to be that
interested in letting us deal with them in an open, public way. I
think, personally, that there&rsquo;s more than one group involved,
with diverse agendas, <I>probably</I>.


<br><br>

According
to abduction and other kinds of research, they&rsquo;re highly
telepathic. They have an ability to manipulate human thinking, human
emotions, as do, in fact, a lot of current military covert
technologies.
<br><br>

They
appear to have some mastery over space-time. They don&rsquo;t seem to
have the kinds of emotional responses that we do, at least not most
of the time. Do they look like us? I think some would suggest, well,
maybe they do. It would be logical, if I were an alien here on Earth,
if I wanted to deal with the native species, I would probably enhance
or manipulate my own native humans and have them do work from me.
<br><br>

Where
are they from? Are they from another planet? Are they from another
time? Are they from another dimension? I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t
know, don&rsquo;t know.
<br><br>

Are
they truthful or not? Ah! Okay. Again, let&rsquo;s pretend that we&rsquo;re
time travelers. You go back a thousand years, you talk to the most
intelligent person in the world a thousand years ago, let&rsquo;s
say, I don&rsquo;t know, some monk in an abbey who happens to be a
genius. You sit down with this person for a day and you try to
describe our world.

<br><br>

How
many mental revolutions is that person going to be able to handle
before they just say: <I>I
can&rsquo;t take it.</I>
Okay? Probably not too many. Tell them that the Earth goes around the
sun, or that there are these little things called viruses, or, you
know, all kinds of technological capabilities. There&rsquo;s only a
certain amount that a person can handle.

<br><br>

If
they&rsquo;re coming here to deal with us, I think it&rsquo;s
reasonable to assume that they&rsquo;re not telling us everything,
either.
<br><br>

Did
they create us? Did they manipulate us? Did they enhance us? If so,
do they see us as their investment? Do they see us as their property?
How long has this been going on?
<br><br>

There&rsquo;re
fallacies involved here. Here&rsquo;s a fallacy: <I>If
they&rsquo;re so technologically advanced, they must have solved
their major social, economic, and political problems. </I>You
hear this a lot. I hear it a lot. I don&rsquo;t buy it at all.
<br><br>

Again,
we go back in time. Let&rsquo;s say all of us go back, with our
iPods, and our cell phones, and maybe a couple of laptops. It doesn&rsquo;t
matter where we go. We meet some people of a thousand years ago and
they look at this laptop and they&rsquo;re like: <I>Whoa,
man, that&rsquo;s cool! For you to have gotten to this level, you
must have solved all of your social, economic, and political
problems!</I> [laughter]

<br><br>

And
then, right, we would look at each other, we&rsquo;d say: <I>Well,
okay, you take care. Oh, and keep that on &ldquo;safety&rdquo;</I>,
you know. Whatever. [laughter]
<br><br>

Okay?
They may not have either. In fact, when you really think about it, if
you look at the species that we know of on Earth, it&rsquo;s only the
highest intellectual species &ndash; us &ndash; that has the ability
to be sadistic, that tortures. Maybe the higher up the ladder you go,
the greater the range, from the angelic to the truly demonic? And,
again, maybe that&rsquo;s the case with them. I don&rsquo;t know.
<br><br>

Are
they ready to welcome us with open arms to the cosmos? This is a
statement, I admit... This is what Dr. Steven Greer actually,
literally, said at Barcelona a couple of months ago. I watched it on
YouTube thinking: <I>W-h-a-a-t?</I>
I&rsquo;m sorry. I beg to differ. I beg to differ. [applause]
<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
a Disclosure Paradox here: <I>It&rsquo;s
impossible, it can never happen, but it&rsquo;s inevitable.</I>
<br><br>

Let&rsquo;s
talk about some of the fallout of Disclosure. These are some, and
certainly not all, of the issues that a true Disclosure&rsquo;s going
to have to deal with: <I>Why
have we been chasing them? Why is this confrontation going on? How
have you been able to keep this secret, Mr. President? What does that
say about the structure of our secrecy?</I>


<br><br>

Oh,
that&rsquo;s going to be a lot of fun to talk about.

<br><br>

What
are all these secret programs about? Is there a secret space program?
That might a tough one for the President or any other responsible
agency to discuss. <I>Yeah,
we actually are going off-world, people, and we&rsquo;ve been going
to Mars and the Moon for &ldquo;x&rdquo; number of years.</I>


<br><br>

You
know, a lot of people might be a little upset about that, having paid
for a program that they may not have known about and might have
wanted some control over.
<br><br>

And
then, dealing with who these other beings are may not be an easy
issue, understanding why they&rsquo;re interested in us.

<br><br>

There
will be challenges -- I guarantee you -- to the structures of power
in this world, politically, finance, industry; all of these. I will
not have time to go through these. This was an expansion of what I
was just telling you.

<br><br>

I
will just pause here, though: <I>Their
interest in us.</I> Why are
they interested in us? Well, it&rsquo;s not that hard for me to see
this one. This is an easy one.

<br><br>

A
hundred years ago we had horses pulling carts. That was our world one
hundred years ago. We&rsquo;re now at the verge of having your
computer be as intelligent as you are. This is the latest from AI
experts. In ten years, they say, your computer will have the full
computational power of one human brain. That&rsquo;s a major
milestone.

<br><br>

And
of course, once they achieve that, they&rsquo;re going to surpass
that. You&rsquo;ll wake up and you&rsquo;ll chat with your computer.
Your computer will sound like a person except, well, it&rsquo;ll be a
little bit smarter than us, you know? Do a quadrillion number of
calculations per second or pull any data off the Internet like that
[snaps fingers], so... a really good personal assistant.

<br><br>

Let&rsquo;s
hope they don&rsquo;t pull a <I>Terminator,</I>
or <I>Matrix,</I>
or an <I>I, Robot</I>
on us.

<br><br>

The
point that I&rsquo;m making is that we&rsquo;re about to reinvent our
whole civilization. Other intelligent species that are looking at
this must be able to know this. They must be able to know that we are
about to leap into their world. We&rsquo;ve actually been in their
world all along; we&rsquo;ve only been asleep. Now, it is time for us
to wake up.
<br><br>

Many,
many, many Disclosure problems &ndash; where do you want to start?
How do you undo a lie this big without angering so many people,
without threatening your own status?

<br><br>

Think
back just a little more than two decades ago to Gorbachev and his
<I>glasnost</I>
which, six years later, ended the Soviet Union. The spiral of reform
became too much. It just got out of his control. You start talking
about openness, and suddenly, the Baltic States say: <I>Great,
we don&rsquo;t want to be in your country anymore.</I>
<I>Remember how you took us
over in 1940?</I> Oh yeah,
that. Right. <I>We&rsquo;re
gone.</I> Okay.

<br><br>

So,
what would happen after 60-plus years of the UFO secret? Would there
be a spiraling out of control? It might start off real manageable; it
might not end that way. Would there be vigilantes? <I>Let&rsquo;s
get the aliens. You&rsquo;re an alien.</I>


<br><br>

What
if we got free energy? Everyone talks about free energy like it&rsquo;s
going to be the greatest thing. What if it isn&rsquo;t? We used to
have free energy &ndash; it was called oil. Oil, I mean, for all
intents and purposes was free for a long time and we did things with
oil that really weren&rsquo;t all that heartwarming to the Earth.

<br><br>

Now,
it&rsquo;s true that with free energy, we might not have to hack down
the whole global ecosystem. You might be able to heat your home
forever for free, I guess. You might be able to make a really neat
bomb, too, and blow up the Pacific Ocean with that same source of
energy, if it&rsquo;s not tightly controlled. I don&rsquo;t know.

<br><br>

There&rsquo;re
a lot of possibilities here. The <I>Fire
of Prometheus</I> can be good
and bad, and again, I&rsquo;m not arguing that we shouldn&rsquo;t
move ahead. We have no choice. History is bigger than we are. Read
Tolstoy, he&rsquo;ll prove it to you &ndash; history is bigger.
Things are going to happen and we&rsquo;re going to get it. It&rsquo;s
going to happen, but it may not be fun. It may not be easy.
<br><br>

And
in the short term, all right, if we discover through the secrets
that, well, there&rsquo;s a better version of petroleum, we don&rsquo;t
need that &ndash; hey, that&rsquo;s great. Steel? Pfff. Awesome...
we&rsquo;ve got this nano-tektite, whatever. Electronics?
<br><br>

Well,
okay. In the long run, this is fabulous; in the short run, it will
mean major financial disruptions. How long will that last? Ten years?
More? It won&rsquo;t be fun, or it <I>may</I>
not be fun, certainly not for those elites who may own those
industries.

<br><br>

But,
it may not be fun for us, either. It&rsquo;s going to be a bumpy
ride, and nevertheless, it will happen. They can&rsquo;t stop this.
You can&rsquo;t stop history. The pace of change is so rapid, it&rsquo;s
so revolutionary -- it will not be stopped.
<br><br>

Bill
Joy, the co-founder of
Sun
Microsystems, was very
concerned, is concerned, over the runaway nature of Artificial
Intelligence, and is afraid of a kind of <I>Terminator</I>-like
scenario, or some other equally-bad thing that may happen, and for a
number of years, has been calling to other executives to try to slow
down or even stop the development of advanced AI.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
impossible. It&rsquo;s spitting into the wind; you can&rsquo;t win.
There&rsquo;re always going to be forces that will... <I>Let&rsquo;s
tweak this program here; we&rsquo;ll fix this software here</I>.
It&rsquo;s going to happen, and it&rsquo;s the same with Disclosure.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
in a very unstable period of our history, it&rsquo;s like
everything&rsquo;s bouncing around. That is exactly my view of the
type of environment in which some monumental mistake will occur in
which the secrets will come out in some way. I don&rsquo;t know how.
I don&rsquo;t know what the trigger will be, but it&rsquo;s going to
happen. When, I don&rsquo;t know either. I predict within ten years.
<br><br>

Now,
when it happens, there&rsquo;s going to be attempts, you know this,
to control <I>the spin</I>.
Okay? It&rsquo;s going to happen, and so it&rsquo;s going to be our
job, the job of any responsible researcher &ndash; and your job -- to
ensure that that does not happen.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;ve
got to make sure that the actual truth comes out, even if it&rsquo;s
horrible, even if it&rsquo;s horrible &ndash; <I>especially</I>
if it&rsquo;s horrible. There&rsquo;s no other way we&rsquo;re going
to be able to deal with the reality, until we learn the full import
of what is going on.

<br><br>

At
the bottom here, I see not one enemy, but maybe two, maybe several.
By that, I mean the enemy isn&rsquo;t just the national security
state which has been hiding this information from us for all these
years... they <I>are</I>
a problem to deal with.

<br><br>

But,
there may be some extraterrestrial, or interdimensional, or non-human
intelligences that may not be working toward our best interests. If
we don&rsquo;t acknowledge that, at least as a distinct possibility,
I think we&rsquo;re fools.

<br><br>

We
have to, even if their intentions may not be bad. What happens to
indigenous cultures when they encounter a
highly-technically-proficient society? We know. It may be in the long
run [that] things get better for them. I don&rsquo;t know. You can
decide that for yourself, but the point is that we have to be
vigilant against a variety of fronts here.

<br><br>

Hope
and fear: <I>Fear is an
enemy</I>. We know this
because when we are afraid, we react irrationally to things, we don&rsquo;t
think through. Hope is an enemy, too, though. That sounds kind of
<I>wrong</I>,
doesn&rsquo;t it? Everyone likes to have hope: <I>Don&rsquo;t
give up hope.</I> But, here&rsquo;s
the problem with hope: <I>Hope
also deludes. </I>

<br><br>

We
need to have a cold eye. We have to be able to look at reality in as
alert and awake a fashion as we can. This is why I love the title of
this conference: <I>Awake and
Aware.</I> That is exactly
right.

<br><br>

What
is true higher consciousness? Well, it starts with awareness, with
seeing things as they are, not as you want them to be, not as you
hope they can be &ndash; you have to see them as they are. It is only
through going over that first large hurdle, I feel, that we can
really attain a true higher consciousness, a true awareness in which
we are awake, not asleep.
<br><br>

Kerry
often writes in her emails: <I>Awaken
the dreamer!</I> I think that
is exactly the attitude that we all must have. We&rsquo;ve been in a
dream state and we have to wake up.
<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
everything. Thank you very much. [applause]
