It&rsquo;s in our genetic memory.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; I      thought that was basically what it was until about two years ago when I      found out that my father was a CIA Agent.&nbsp; My father has been dead      now for almost 15 years.&nbsp; I never had a clue.&nbsp; But with that      new information it made a lot of smaller tidbits of information and a lot      of things that happened in the past, now it all fits. Ok. Basically what      happened with me was in 1966 I was 6 years old and both of my parents loaded      me up in a trunk and took me to town.&nbsp; It was a dark cold snowy; I&rsquo;ll      never forget the day, Ok, because it stands out.&nbsp; Why are we going      into a hardware store this late in the afternoon?&nbsp; So we go into the      store and at that time my mom and day aren&rsquo;t fighting but they aren&rsquo;t      getting along.&nbsp; And, I have been in the store several times with my      grandfather and we&rsquo;d go into the back, I never been in the back and      there&rsquo;s a door there and if you didn&rsquo;t know it was there you&rsquo;d      walk right by it and so we go in and here&rsquo;s 6 or 7 other kids about      my age, and they are all sitting at these tables like kindergarten tables,      sitting down low in these small chairs and they all had the same things,      they looked like puzzle pieces.&nbsp; Well, this lady comes in that did      not fit, ok.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She&rsquo;s tall, elegant, fur coat. This is Eastern Kentucky. This don&rsquo;t      happen. Alright. And she played a very prominent role from there on.&nbsp; I      have seen her in several of my memories. And she sets me down to play.&nbsp; She      gave me a stack of blocks. And what they are are puzzle pieces. And she      says &ldquo;I want you to make me a picture&rdquo; and walked off.&nbsp; So,      I looked around for my mom and she is with a guy there who is in a suit      who again should not be there and he had a clipboard she&rsquo;s signing      some papers.&nbsp; At six years old, I was puzzled, but you don&rsquo;t      think much of it.&nbsp; So, I sit there and I start taking these puzzle      pieces and said &ldquo;this fits, this fits, this don&rsquo;t fit&rdquo;.&nbsp; And,      I&rsquo;m going: <em>this is making a picture</em>, and I sit back. The      lady walks up to the front, the guy walks up behind me.&nbsp;&nbsp; She      looks at him and smiles and says &ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;ve got one</em>&rdquo; and      that&rsquo;s when it started.&nbsp; I was given something to drink, I remember      feeling sleepy, and that&rsquo;s it. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So,    are you saying, did you go home with your parents?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; No,    I did not. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; I    see. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; I was taken directly.&nbsp; This is what I found out later.&nbsp; Because      once I went to sleep with whatever was in the drink, Kool-aid, soda, or      whatever, put me out.&nbsp; My next memory was at 9 and &frac12; years      old. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So,    you have a blank in your memory right now. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Mm hm, yeah.&nbsp; Now, I have some memories have come back and      I have bits and pieces of what happened during all of that, some very vivid,      some I have documentation, some are just memories that are there.&nbsp; Umm,      and, then from there. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So,        at nine years old, why do you remember nine years old, what happened      then?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Because I was had taken a stint at the local hospital, hospital      here, University of Kentucky.&nbsp; They did some type of procedures that      no-one ever has really been able to explain to me.&nbsp; Even as an adult      I tried to get the records, and no-one will release those records to me.&nbsp; And,      from there I had couple of years as a kid where everything seemed ok, lot      of paranormal activity going on and all that and then at 14 I&rsquo;m gone      again. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Gone    to the hospital? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; No,        gone, memories gone. <br>      <br>      K:&nbsp; Oh, Ok, so, so looking back though, you basically feel that you      were trained as a soldier during&nbsp; that time?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yes. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Could    you describe some of the training to us? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; The    easiest way to do that is to back up for one second. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Sure.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Imagine Project Talent, the people in Project Talent being sent      to school. Ok, when we&rsquo;re in elementary school we&rsquo;re all taught      the same thing.&nbsp; Ok, that&rsquo;s where the martial arts training      was started. I have vivid memories of 15 20 of us in a group with adults      and they trained us as adults.&nbsp; There was no kids gloves. Ok. Six,      Seven years old, eight years old you got your butt kicked off. I mean they      beat you tremendously, but you learned, ok. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Mm    hm. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Once you, and the paranormal training started as well.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s      where they were weaning who is good at that, who is good at this, who&rsquo;s      going to be a solider, who&rsquo;s going to be a psychic spy? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; You    have at this time, certain, umm, like a black belt in karate?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Even after I continued on, I took classes on my own, started      a couple of studios.&nbsp; I hold a fifth degree black now, legitimately      a fifth degree black. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; In    the real world, so to speak?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Right,    right. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; You also said something in an interview I read that said something      about remembered when you started teaching karate.&nbsp; This is how you      triggered some earlier memories of all this. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Mm hm, right. There was one incident in particular.&nbsp; I have      a friend of mine who is an ex-marine beret. And he was more than a regular,      he would come in and work out with me when he was home on leave or those      kinds of things. And, he we was sparring one night and he was a big raw      boned guy, you know he was going to want to barrow my path with not sweating.      So, we&rsquo;re sparring and I did a technique that when he came up off      the floor he&rsquo;s angry bamboozled. &ldquo;Where did you learn that?&rdquo; And,      it hit me, I don&rsquo;t have a clue, where did I learn that? He said that      came straight off the farm.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only 19 years old. The farm?      What are you talking about? Cattle farm? The pig farm? I didn&rsquo;t have      a clue and he said the CIA Training Facility, The Farm.&nbsp; And those      things started clicking. Ok. And, when I really started getting memories      back was about 8, 9 years ago when I had an automobile accident and it      ruptured three discs in my neck. And, when they finally gave me the MRI,      the electromagnetic resonance didn&rsquo;t mesh with the cranial implant.&nbsp; </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That    you had gotten? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Somewhere, somehow, I have a cranial implant. And, I say this      because I have it on film.&nbsp; And, when they put me in the MRI machine,      when they turned it on, when it started to spin, Ok. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Imagine tremendous pain.&nbsp; Also imagine you&rsquo;re in there      and you see a thousand TV screens and they come at you at once. On each      one of those TV screens is a picture.&nbsp; Each picture is a memory and      it just kept coming, coming, coming. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s    amazing. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s    how I started to get total memory again. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And now, I don&rsquo;t      know was this also correct, you were screaming and the MRI blew up? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; The machine itself caught on fire. That&rsquo;s what brought      me out of it. Because I&rsquo;m there in&nbsp; nothing but my underwear      and a gown holding my head screaming bloody murder and I notice smoke ok,      and the techs come out, the nurses come out and they want to do all this      and they are getting me out of there, they start the fire extinguishers      and all that. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Now,    do you still have the cranial implant to this day? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s still there. It&rsquo;s just, from what I understand      it&rsquo;s not working. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; What makes you think it&rsquo;s    not working? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Because I haven&rsquo;t been used anymore. I haven&rsquo;t had      a black out spell and be gone for three or four days or a week with no      memory. They stopped. This one is dead center dead center in the brain.      It looks like a grain of rice and it&rsquo;s just dead center in the brain.      It&rsquo;s right there. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s    that small?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s    that small. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Wow.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; And I had it checked through independent sources and they look      at it. &ldquo;You got a problem, that&rsquo;s got to be removed&rdquo;.&nbsp; Man,      you&rsquo;re going to die.&nbsp; I say, no it&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t      tell them what it is. I just want to get there opinion &ndash; hear what      they&rsquo;re going to say.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say anything unless I have      the proof or I have someone else who is willing to sign a deposition saying      that they were there, they saw it, they know. If I don&rsquo;t have proof,      I&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;this is what I think&rdquo;. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; So,      back when you were a child and you go to the hospital you said.&nbsp; </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Mm    hm.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Did        you have something going on with your body that they changed at that      time? Do you know what happened? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; I remember going through a procedure ok and I remember waking      up and the machine, and this would have been in 1969 and I remember the      machine was about the size of this table came with a wrap and they were      bringing it down on top of me and it would get hot and I wasn&rsquo;t supposed      to wake up I was supposed to be drugged completely.&nbsp; Well, I woke      up in the middle of it and I remember being dozens of tubes laying to each      side of me where they had been plugged in one at a time. Now, what happened?      I don&rsquo;t know. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Now, did you have uncommon strength or were you, you know, did      you notice drastic changes in your outlook towards reality? I mean at 14      this was probably hard to tell. But, you know as time went on, do you think      that you&rsquo;ve developed at a different rate than some other children      because of some of this? <br>      <br>      D:&nbsp; Yeah, I think so. I have always been stronger, faster; more endurance      than anybody around and that is also the same with all of us that came      out of these projects. That is part of the super soldier structure.&nbsp; They      want the super soldier to be just that super&nbsp; - beyond normal, faster,      stronger, more endurance, pain tolerance, etc. etc. on and on and on. That&rsquo;s      what they want. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So,        can you tell us what abilities you have at the peak of your performance      if you want to call it that? What do you think you were capable of? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Physical ones, yeah, I kept. The paranormal abilities &ndash; I      have kept some. The main paranormal abilities come out when the ultimate      personality comes out. That&rsquo;s one of the things that they did&nbsp; to      us was to give us ultimate personality. We were trained in the ultimate      personality. I have witnesses that saw me bust heavy bags with one punch.      You&rsquo;re not supposed to be able to do that.&nbsp; I was measured for      punching power speed and everything at Burlington, Wisconsin at a facility      up there that is no longer there that did all the testing for the pro sports,      for football teams and all that. My punching power, at this time was my      weight - 175 pounds. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And,      when are we talking? How many years ago or what year, generally speaking?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; In 1984, in the spring of 1984.&nbsp; And, the testing came out      as unreal. My punching power was heavier, stronger than that of a super      heavyweight boxer. My kicking power and speed was even more than that.      My kicks in my right leg were 120 mph. My punching power was well over      18 to 1950 foot pounds.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll bust concrete blocks. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Ok,    now in terms of your physic ability, what were those abilities? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; My primary physic abilities are the ones that I have kept in      this personality is being able to get in someone&rsquo;s mind, being able      to foresee what events in real time and when I mean get in someone&rsquo;s      mind I don&rsquo;t mean read their mind, read their thoughts, hear their      thoughts. It&rsquo;s more of what some people that I work with now call      picting. We see pictures of their thoughts. Like, you may be thirsty thinking      about a soda. I&rsquo;ll look at you and I&rsquo;ll see a Pepsi can. That&rsquo;s      what would happen.&nbsp; And, these types of abilities to a fighter, a      soldier, or an assassin, think of the edge that gives that person. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So, do you have absolute recall of times when you&rsquo;re      in the other personality now? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; I    have witnesses to that, yeah. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; You see, what happened, is I&rsquo;m not supposed to remember      anything right now.&nbsp; Ok. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; I    imagine. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; The people who start to remember are usually late 50&rsquo;s      early 60&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Ok, much too old to really do anything, but I&rsquo;m      not saying 60&rsquo;s old, but in this society by the time you&rsquo;re      60, 62 anywhere in there, people write you off. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So how old are you now because I can&rsquo;t    tell?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; 46.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m    46.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Uh    huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Everybody says that you don&rsquo;t look 46, that&rsquo;s      one of the other traits that we have. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; The    longevity? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yeah.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Ok.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Most of the people who start getting their memories back, when      they get there memories back&nbsp; are the ones whose personalities begin      to mesh.

So, when all these other memories start coming in      meshing with the other memories, they go nuts. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Most    of the people? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yes.

That&rsquo;s how serious the accident was.&nbsp; Two o'clock        in the morning I&rsquo;m sitting in my apartment in New Jersey and this        little voice comes in. &ldquo;What the &hellip;. is your problem?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s      wrong with you?

I can go to a neurologist right now      and let him do an x-ray and they&rsquo;ll look at me and say that I need      to be in surgery today, but I refuse to go. The pain is still there. I      live with pain 24/7 and, again, if this hadn&rsquo;t happened been done      to me as a kid, yeah, I&rsquo;m probably taking pain pills on a regular      basis. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But, you&rsquo;re    not. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; I    take nothing. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;m        curious because you have this tattoo on your arm.

And, I&rsquo;m walking      in a Wal-Mart across the street of all places about six months ago and      that is on the front cover of a paper back novel.

So, what happened in Vietnam,&nbsp; because      you have a really amazing story about that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; I was in North Vietnam twice that I know of.&nbsp; Some        of these areas are still murky because like I said I keep finding out      more things everyday. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Ok. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Once when I was twelve years old. Ok.&nbsp; I know people say      it was 1972 you were in Vietnam, it was 1972. Actually it wasn&rsquo;t      Vietnam, it was Cambodia. We weren&rsquo;t supposed to be in Cambodia.&nbsp; A      Navy Seal Team and a Marine Corps recon Team were pinned down by the Cambodia      Khmer Rouge. They called in for reinforcements for somebody to get them      out. And, I&rsquo;m telling you exactly what a Marine Corps recon Captain      and a Navy Seal Captain told me. Now, I have my own memories of it, but      I saw it from my point of view. I&rsquo;m going to tell you from their      point of view. One black helicopter, Huey, lands, 12 kids come off the      chopper. Yeah, there are still a couple of things. <em>[emotional...]</em></font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Take    your time.

I was like the lead battery, but I wasn&rsquo;t      the one who did the target. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t    actually aim your power?

Well, we really appreciate that you&rsquo;re sharing this      with us, because this is obviously a huge thing and people never really      like talking about the sort of negative side of the powers of the mind      but obviously this is one of the applications and there&rsquo;s really      no reason to hide it. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not that.. It&rsquo;s funny. I did a lot of things      that were not of my doing, not of my making. Some of them bring out an      emotional response, some don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Some are kinda like &ldquo;so      what?&rdquo; and some I have no control and I go through this little emotional,      and then I&rsquo;m fine with it. I can&rsquo;t cry on command. Believe      me I tried (laughs). But, the way it was explained to me, it makes perfect      sense. Twelve kids, imagine twelve batteries connected. You have one battery,      you might get nothing. Add two, you get a jolt. Add three, you get a burn.      Add <em>twelve</em>, and get electrocuted. That&rsquo;s basically what      we did. The twelve of us linked and joined up through everything, kind      of a semi-circle... starting from the center, because I was in the center.&nbsp; Like      this <em>(illustrates with his hands)</em>... out. That&rsquo;s what happened.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And        this was something you guys were obviously trained to do. Do you have      a memory at all? Has anything come back of your trainers? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Remember that lady at the hardware store? Yeah, she figured very      prominently when I was young. The next memory I have of her is in a lab      coat. And I&rsquo;m in this house. It&rsquo;s been described to me as a      mansion, and I have a couple of ideas where this place is or was, but I      have no proof. There is a... I&rsquo;m in a hallway, and there&rsquo;s      green and white tile, just huge, 12 x 12, these 12 x 12 tiles on the floor.      And I&rsquo;m doing something that all of us that come out of this has      the same trait. We don&rsquo;t come down on one knee or anything like that &ndash; we      squat. It makes no sense in some ways, but in some ways to us it does.&nbsp; We      squat on the balls of our feet with the arms out loose. It&rsquo;s almost      like an animal. About ten feet away I have a small water bucket. And what      I&rsquo;m doing is raising the bucket, trying to turn it over, and set      it down gently. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Raising    it with your mind or with your hands? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Correct,    just with my mind.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; I    see. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; And what I&rsquo;m doing is raising it, turning it about half      way, and it&rsquo;s just dropping. I&rsquo;m not getting it and I look      around and this lady is behind me with her clipboard taking notes, and      I tried to get a response trying to be nice: &ldquo;I almost got it, I      almost got it,&rdquo; and she basically just looks down and snarls and      walks off. There was nothing nice about any of this. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So,        ok, you said you were in Vietnam twice that you remembered. What was      the second time? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; The second time, all I remember is being shot down. We were taking      off in a Black Hawk. I&rsquo;m sorry, not a Black Hawk, that was another      incident. A Huey, and we got about ten feet off the ground and we took      some anti aircraft fire and we went down and this navy seal captain that      we talked about was the one that pulled me out of the chopper. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And        this guy is the witness that you said that is witness to the Vietnam      incident with the kids? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Correct. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And    he was in charge of? Where was he at the time? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; The easiest way to tell you about this guy &ndash; His        whole family was in the CIA. Ok. He was one of the most decorated and        had one of the best kill records in Vietnam. His abilities as a sniper        were unparallel. And, at the same time, he was also a sailboat captain      because he pulled I think five or seven tours in Vietnam. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t    messed with as you were? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; He        does have some memories but not to the extent that I was or some of the      other guys. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So,    how did you guys hook up? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; When      I started getting my memories back I started looking for him. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Because        you remembered from the age of twelve who he was? <br>      <br>      D:&nbsp; Yes. I remembered his face and I knew being what he was he was      only going to be in certain circles and so I started frequenting those      circles and I finally found him and we sat down at dinner at a casino and      started trading stories and that is history. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; Is    he willing to come forward on record? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; He    is yes. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; Would    you recommend him? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yes,    absolutely. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So,      can you tell us a little bit more? I imagine you were a remote viewer? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yes,    but not the best. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So        you were physically trained, you were mentally very astute.

My first impulse was to go to DC and just go nuts.      Ok. Well, as the old saying goes, I&rsquo;m crazy but not stupid, and as      a fighter I was trained channel your anger, don&rsquo;t let your anger      channel you and that&rsquo;s what I started doing.

There&rsquo;s not      going to be class action lawsuits.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not going to be      prosecution. That&rsquo;s fine, I got over that years ago. Everybody else      involved needs to get over that. Just hold them accountable and get it      stopped. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; Do    you think this is still going on today? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yes,    absolutely I do. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; Do you have any idea in one form these projects are continuing?&nbsp; They      said in the 60&rsquo;s there were about a thousand kids and there are only      about 60 left?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; In 1966 there were supposed to have been 1000 kids taken that      were in my group. There are only about 20 of us left now. I think what      I have to explain. We were actually at 6, 7 years old put into survival      defense. Our personalities were split. Any normal kid, any normal person      would not do the things we did in their right frame of minds. So, they      had to split our personalities and they had a clean slate with that new      personality, had no rhyme, no reason, no right, no wrong, no concept so      they made it into what they wanted it to be. This is how they split my      personality. Now, I don&rsquo;t know,&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure they did the      same identical thing to other people, but I know for a fact not to each      one. There were different techniques for different kids. How they described      it to me when I was a kid was &ldquo;These were your treatments&rdquo;,      almost medical terminology.&nbsp; Imagine being six years old... and the      funny thing is I can describe this with very little emotion because it      happened to me, not something I did. You&rsquo;re strapped naked to a wooden      chair, arms out like this, you&rsquo;re strapped, here, here and here.      Your fingertips are spread open and things are inserted here so you can&rsquo;t      do this <em>(moving hand and fingers over table)</em> and I know you noticed      because I saw it in your minds and I saw it in your eyes, I have a phobia      about my fingertips. What they did was they inserted needles underneath      the fingertips. That&rsquo;s bad enough, hook those needles up to an electric      current and turn it on.&nbsp; Waterboarding is where you basically drown      the person and bring then back them back and in my case they did it two      ways, strapped to a chair and they took a water hose and sprayed it at      you until you couldn&rsquo;t breath and then they&rsquo;d bring you back      and I remember having my head dunked. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t swim. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Now,    what would be the purpose of that? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; To cause pain - intense pain. What happens when the body and      the psychic goes through the amount of pain that it can tolerate, you black      out, you pass out, you faint. Well, the Germans brought over a drug with      them. Once injected it blocks those receptors. You can&rsquo;t black out,      you can&rsquo;t even force yourself to faint. So, once the psychic gets      to a point where it can&rsquo;t take any more you have two choices, split      off into another personality, you save yourself or die. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Ok, I understand, when the pain becomes too much the way you&rsquo;re      able to survive and stay together mentally is actually to go someplace      else?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Exactly.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And you go so far someplace else that you&rsquo;re      actually creating another personality? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Exactly, you create a totally separate individual to where they      can pull out that ultimate personality and one second I&rsquo;m me and      next second I&rsquo;m somebody else. Now, I&rsquo;m back to me. That&rsquo;s      how they wanted you.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Have    you seen <em>The Manchurian Candidate?</em> </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; You    never saw that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Ok, well, if I refer to it, you&rsquo;ll        know what I mean?<br>      <br>      D:&nbsp; Yeah.

In order to open a combination safe you got to have a combination      which is more than one number, so I think what they did, they set up...      you have to have a system of checks, balances, and failsafes to where if      you&rsquo;re watching TV and all of sudden you hear the correct word or      whatever you freak out and kill everybody, and then you would start seeing      this happening everywhere, so there has to be a failsafe to keep that from      happening so I&rsquo;ve always thought that it&rsquo;s a combination of      words, tones, numbers, what have you.&nbsp; What happened during this night      is I went to bed, my wife and I were in bed, the phone rings, I reach over      to pick it up and put it to more my ear, no more than three seconds passed      I hang the phone up, I get up get dressed and I leave. I&rsquo;m gone three      days and three nights and at that time we lived exactly eleven miles from      the airport that you guys passed coming here.

I&rsquo;m sitting in a Mexican      restaurant, a very nice two story Mexican restaurant, and I hear somebody      laughing. This was before the president now was the governor of Texas.      I look over and there was George Junior sitting at the bar with the secret      service bodyguards, drunk as a skunk with the secret service trying to      get him to calm down. Now, that&rsquo;s when I snapped awake. I don&rsquo;t      remember driving there... and I&rsquo;m looking around, and I&rsquo;m:      Where the hell am I at, and but yet there he is and I had one impulse &ndash; kill      him. Terminate. And I had a gun in my pocket. And for whatever reason I      fought the impulse down and I didn&rsquo;t kill him. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; In other words, you remember who he is now but you didn&rsquo;t      know who he was? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; At that time I didn&rsquo;t have a clue who he was. I was sitting      there sometime later and I&rsquo;m watching the news where it said that      Governor Bush placed his bid for the presidency and I&rsquo;m looking at      him thinking &ldquo;Holy...&rdquo;. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; Was    this before he became president? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yes. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; I    got it. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Years    before. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; So,        in that context, maybe it makes even more sense?<br>      <br>      D:&nbsp; Yes, and it makes it more scarier. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; What        about underground bases? You think you ever been in an underground base?      Have you ever been in any underground bases? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; I know where one is, right here in the state. When I was in my      mid to late, mostly late teens, that I remember, the farmhouse that we      lived on was situated in a valley and there were old logging roads that      went all around the valley.&nbsp; I had a good five-mile run up and down      the mountains on a good graded road. There were also some worked out strip      mines over to the southeast of there. One day I&rsquo;m running up through      there and I decide to drop down over the hill to have a look around. As      soon as I do I feel the vibrations in the ground and I drop down and I      put my ear down near the ground the way that my grandfather taught me how      to do and I get up and this little voice says &ldquo;get the hell out of      here&rdquo; and as I&rsquo;m running back up the hill a chopper lands.&nbsp; I      didn&rsquo;t go back anymore, but a couple days later two things happened      at once. My father had a friend.&nbsp; His name was Paul Preston. Paul      Preston was somebody and is still somebody who I&rsquo;d terminate with      extreme prejudice. I don&rsquo;t care to say that. When I was fourteen      we we&rsquo;re getting ready to work the fields, we had a cash farm and      I was working on a tractor. We lived about a mile up off the dirt road      off the main road and I could sense a vehicle coming up the road before      it was half way up. I stop and I look out and I could see this grayish      silver van coming up into the driveway, brand new with a UHF antenna on      top. I never seen anything like this.&nbsp; Again this is Kentucky in the      mid 70&rsquo;s, nobody had that kind of money, this was before the coal      boom, before the energy crisis, before people made twenty bucks an hour,      people were lucky to make minimum wage. Ok. And this guy gets out of this      van and I noticed it had Texas tags. I had heard my dad talk about this      guy, that they were childhood friends and then this was confirmed to me      later on that they were in the CIA together and that Paul Preston was station      chief in more than one area. He gets out of the van, calls me by name.      I never met the guy before to my knowledge and in that instance I had two      thoughts, one was to run, because this guy was bad news, this guy was dangerous,      run, the other was to take him out &ndash; kill him before he kills you.      I was only fourteen years old, my hair was longer than it is now and my      dad comes down from the house, and they do the handshakes, slap on the      back, huggy huggy and all this kind of stuff. Mr. Preston looks at my dad      gets real serious, says we got to talk. My dad&rsquo;s demeanor changes      so they go away for about twenty minutes and during this time, I got the      tool chest, I&rsquo;m trying to get the tractor going, spring plow, all      that kind of stuff. Twenty, thirty minutes later Paul Preston comes back      down from house, he&rsquo;s aint talking to me then, he&rsquo;s in a bad      mood, gets in the van and leaves. I barely saw my dad the rest of that      day cause it&rsquo;s early morning, it&rsquo;s still cool. You don&rsquo;t      want to be around him for the rest of the day, he was a real ticked off      Irishman.&nbsp; Well that night ok, my mom had a habit of sitting on the      front porch at night and I slept upstairs. She came in that night about      ten or eleven o&rsquo;clock screaming at my dad that there was something      above the house and by the time he went out it was gone and I could hear      the whole conversation. She said it was bigger than the house was round      and had lights all around it. I didn&rsquo;t know nothing about UFO&rsquo;s.      I knew nothing about that. I knew farming, martial arts, I knew how to      fight, track, hunt, etc. etc. I knew nothing about that. So, the next night      this happens again. The third day, something happens to me. All the time,      I work and I train I work and I train. I worked out harder than I had ever      done before. I think the reason being was to go to bed early, because that&rsquo;s      exactly what I did, I went to bed early. That night, I go to bed, I was      laying there, I don&rsquo;t know how long, but I feel like I&rsquo;m on      fire, when I snapped awake, I can&rsquo;t move.&nbsp; All I can do is open      my eyes, the whole upstairs is full of light and I can see a five pedal      figure standing by the bed. I can see a head, I can see the arms, I can      see the legs, and that&rsquo;s it and I know it&rsquo;s talking to me,      it&rsquo;s telling me something and the next thing I know my daddy is shaking      my shoulders with my brothers because saw the light and they thought the      upstairs was on fire.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all I remember. I don&rsquo;t      remember anything again until I&rsquo;m almost eighteen.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Meaning    no memories from the age of fourteen and the age of eighteen? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Right. I didn&rsquo;t have my driver&rsquo;s license until I      was almost eighteen.&nbsp; Should have had them when I was sixteen. I didn&rsquo;t      get them until I was almost eighteen because I wasn&rsquo;t around to get      him. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Do      you remember what the being looked like other than two arms, two legs?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all I could see, a torso, two arms, two legs, and      a head, not an oval shaped head, but a head shaped head, a normal shaped      head. I&rsquo;d estimate about six feet tall, it was white as well, but      a paler shade of white in the rest of the room.&nbsp; I think all of these      go together, the visit of Paul Preston, the craft over the house, and in      my leaving again all go together. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And your father&rsquo;s    anger perhaps? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yeah, I think he may have thought for whatever reason I was clear      of it and for whatever reason Paul Preston came by and said no. I don&rsquo;t      think he had a choice in the matter. The only anger I had with them is      not coming out and telling me something especially after I&rsquo;m an adult      and I&rsquo;m starting to get memories back and I&rsquo;m asking what gives?      I know this wasn&rsquo;t what happened something wasn&rsquo;t right. I      think I deserved more of an answer than &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you&rdquo; and      then leave.&nbsp; The first thing I did when I got my memories back was      I started looking up old friends. And, I would ask them during this year,      73, 74, 75 where were we, what were you doing? I have memories of doing      things and everyone of them to a T were &ldquo;we were out doing this&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;I      remember that&rdquo; and they would go &ldquo;how could you, you weren&rsquo;t      here&rdquo;. And one guy even went so far to say &ldquo;we went up to the      farm to pick you up one day to see if you wanted to go away, we hadn&rsquo;t      heard from you and your dad ran us off.&rdquo; Those were from what I had      of those years were false memories. The memories I had of camping, going      to Diary Queen, you know that kind of thing were implanted. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So,      you also said in your writing that you have one of your arms is wired? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; The        right one. Yes, the implant is right here <em>(points to        upper right shoulder blade area)</em>. I know it&rsquo;s there for two        specific reasons, one I had a guy put a meter over it and had it found        that way and two, it itches and what it is, I call it an enhancer it        increases physical strength and speed there are like wires that run from        it to the fingers and it&rsquo;s only in this shoulder, it&rsquo;s not        body wise.&nbsp; This is the hand and the arm that I busted many heavy        bags with.&nbsp; As a matter of fact there was an incident where I grabbed        a guy who was a good 40 pounds heavier than me straight up off his feet        and when I realized what I had done, it just dropped. I don&rsquo;t know        the science of how it&rsquo;s tied in, I really don&rsquo;t, but I know        it&rsquo;s tied in with the fight/flight scenario when there is danger,        it kicks in, if feel threatened it kicks in.&nbsp; The throwing of energy,        yeah, that one freaked me out when it happened. I had a job in Lexington,        the place at that time was called The Community Kitchen. It was no kitchen.        What it was was a facility for homeless, indigent, that kind of thing.&nbsp; We        had doctors&rsquo; offices, we had social service offices, showers, clothing,        all that, but it was also a haven for pushers, users, abusers, rapists,        killers, you name it, they came in there.&nbsp; We could have had sixty        to a hundred people in the facility at one time and I was chief of security        and we had a fight that broke out and it was nothing, we had three or        four fights a day, ok, but we had two girls get into it.&nbsp; They fight        worse than men, ok. and my partner had one holding her down, I was holding        the other one down and when I say holding them down, I was just sitting        there with one arm on her shoulder.&nbsp; She was laughing about it.        The next thing I know, I look up and I see this extremely large man standing        over top of me and he&rsquo;s got three or four friends with him and        he&rsquo;s giving this routine, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving you to the count        of whatever to get off of her or I&rsquo;m going to do this&rdquo;. Well,        I snapped, I&rsquo;m on the ground, I look up, I see I&rsquo;m outnumbered,        outgunned. I change. Normally I would have just rolled out of the way,        got up, started cussing right back at him, throw him out the door, but        no, I stood up and hit him and the witnesses there said I hit him not        once, but twelve times in the matter of a second. It broke his neck.        His neck was as big as my legs and it just snapped his neck. Well, when        that happened, the whole facility went berserk.&nbsp; Half of them were        coming at me and my partner and the other half was using it as an excuse        to get whoever they didn&rsquo;t like and it&rsquo;s during these times        that something happens that I can&rsquo;t explain.&nbsp; It was like        I stepped outside of space and time, everything turned black and white;        everything goes slow motion. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve got all the time        in the world to go from point A to point B, because this guy aint moving.        Ok, and it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m just walking through, bam, bam, bam,        guys going down and then I&rsquo;m grabbed. This guy grabs me by the        throat and I just snapped sideways and threw my hands palm down, just        threw them down and screamed inside my mind.&nbsp; The guy goes up and        back. I never touched him. And when that happened that ended the entire        fight. I&rsquo;m standing there and I&rsquo;m looking around and I&rsquo;m        suddenly aware that everybody was staring at me and sometime during this        time the cops have been called. So, here come the cops, here come the        ambulances, the paramedics, and I talked to one of the cops to give a        report.&nbsp; Half of them are taken to the hospital, the other half        of them are barred out, some are taken to jail. And I went to nearest        bar I could find, and I sat there because I didn&rsquo;t know what to        do. I knew something had happened. I knew it was real because people        were saying coming up to me, &ldquo;What did you do&rdquo;? &ldquo;How        did you do that?&rdquo; And I don&rsquo;t have an answer for you. I don&rsquo;t        know. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; What    year did that happen?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; 1989 or 1990. I&rsquo;m trying to. I worked so many jobs, during      that time, during those years, which is something else that I&rsquo;ve      been told that is indicative of us that have come out of these black operations.      I know from personal experience it would be the greatest thing since sliced      bread for a couple of months and then all of a sudden a boss or supervisor      would come and find something wrong and we&rsquo;re fired. What I found      out over the years is that&rsquo;s not unique to me. They want to keep      you one step below poverty level, keeps your mind occupied on other things. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right, survival, daily survival so that you can&rsquo;t      go further into your own memories type of things. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; And, there&rsquo;s also another reason for that, and I&rsquo;ve      been told this by more than one person. Who listens to somebody who is      broke? Everybody listens to someone who is wealthy and I think those two      go together to make that. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; There        is an incident which you also reported that you described as a kind of        personal teleportation incident where you went through a wall and you      had a witness. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yes,    absolutely.</font></p><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; What        do you recall of that? <br>    <br>      D:&nbsp; I get freaked out every time I think of that. It was at a house      in Oklahoma and I was helping a friend of mine move and I was in the one      bedroom and she was in the kitchen.&nbsp; For me to get from the bed to      the front door would entail going down, cutting across, down, cutting across,      a very windy way. Well as I said she was in the kitchen straight line,      kitchen, living room, front door, no door in between, no wall in between.      Well she was reading and doing her own thing in the kitchen and I&rsquo;m      sound asleep and her youngest son gets up screaming and goes to the front      door trying to get out. It&rsquo;s 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.&nbsp; She      jumps up and starts to run to get him.&nbsp; I hear the scream, I remember      raising up on one shoulder, in the mind seeing the kid reaching towards      the door get out past the door. She said that I came out through the      wall in front of her and all she could do was to stop and say WHOA. And,      I think whatever I did, if I froze inside that wall, that would have been      fun. My grandfather, my mom&rsquo;s mom, was a full blooded Cherokee, and      he gave me the name of grey feather and I asked him once, I said &ldquo;Pops,      what does grey feather mean&rdquo;? and he said &ldquo;I was a between      man&rdquo; and he had an accent, and I asked him what he means and he said &ldquo;you      walk between worlds&rdquo; and this was before I knew anything about anything.      I saw 911 two weeks before it happened. I put it up on some bulletin boards      on the net and I was laughed at. I lived in Delaware at that time, right      on the eastern shore, walking distance to the beach. I had a trip planned      to Boston, couple of days before the trip cause we were going to drive      it, I get a phone call and it&rsquo;s the metallic digitized voice and      it says postpone your trip, two day window plus or minus one day whether      here or here, there&rsquo;s going to be something big in New York and you      don&rsquo;t want to get caught in it. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Now,        have there been other premonitions that haven&rsquo;t      come true yet? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yeah,        I have seen this country almost split in half, I mean physically split        in half. Again, I lived in Delaware, and I just laid down, it was one        of those times where one minute I&rsquo;m here and the next I&rsquo;m      here, and I&rsquo;m here looking down on the United States. This was before      I knew about the supervolcano and all this and that but I saw that area      going up into Canada, coming all the way into Mexico, the whole western      part of the country split off from the rest of the United States and what      I&rsquo;m seeing is like a river of fire coming all the way down. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And    did you have a time line for that? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Soon,    very soon. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So        are you making any plans for yourself and your family because of what      you are dreaming or seeing? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Yeah. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Are    you finding a safe place? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; There's        really not going to be a safe place. The best preparedness that        I know of is to be able to be mobile. There is no one safe place. I started        to go public when I lived in Delaware after an attempt was made on my        life. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; When    was that approximately? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; About 2002. I had other things that happened but nothing where      I had made any connection. Now, I make a connection. I was out for a jog      and it was in the wintertime and I hear a motorcycle. Motorcycle? You ever      been on the east coast in the wintertime when the wind blows? It&rsquo;s      frigid. And I&rsquo;m out jogging and I hear a motorcycle and the ears      go up, hair start standing up and I go from a hard run to a light jog and      I see the motorcycle, solid black motorcycle, no insignia, just solid black,      two riders dressed in black with black opaque masks. I&rsquo;m going this      way and they are going this way. This thing is going so slow, I&rsquo;m      trying to figure out how in the world is it staying up and as it comes      up to me, I&rsquo;m running scenarios, I&rsquo;m wearing ankle and wrist      weights, ok, I&rsquo;m waiting to see a gun, so I&rsquo;m thinking this      is coming off, this is going to throw, forward roll, kick the back wheel,      try to get an advantage.&nbsp; The guy does open his coat, puts his hands      in his coat - this is the rider. All I see is two fingers, points them      at me and goes like this <em>(firing of gun signaling with hand) </em>and      goes back. I&rsquo;m thinking this is just a warning, ok, and they slowly      go on down the road along route one to go north. I didn&rsquo;t make it      ten steps, I had to puke, bile, everything, I had to crawl home, I was      sick for three days, I finally went to the doctor and said I have had some      kind of unknown viral infection. He did shoot me... just not with a gun.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Half the people        who hear what I have to say look at it and say what a lying stack of        dung.&nbsp; This is so much BS, there is no way any of this      could happen, etc. etc. etc. Well, I&rsquo;ll give a response that I gave      to a guy on a radio show one night. I wish that were true, I&rsquo;d love      to be able take a pill everyday and have a nice life, but I can&rsquo;t      because it did happen and I don&rsquo;t have the whole story myself and      I may never get it. What happened to me, and I talked about the split personality,      that was just the tip of the iceberg, ok. I remembered the beatings, being      thrown naked into a refrigerator, a refrigerator room, because I couldn&rsquo;t      get something right, but not just to me, but to all of us in this particular      group and this type of stuff should not have happened. We consider ourselves      to be a civilized free society. There&rsquo;s nothing civilized about this,      there&rsquo;s nothing free about this. There is strength in numbers. I      would like to see, I mean come on, you have a million man march on Washington      put together by somebody that the government laughed at. Why couldn&rsquo;t      we do the same thing? This stuff has got to stop. You know, people, like      I said we&rsquo;re supposed to live in a civilized free society. We don&rsquo;t.      When they can walk in and take you as a child, turn you into a killer and      then use you abuse you and when they are done, throw you away and you asked      earlier what is the one thing I would like to see come of this and any      subsequent movies/videos or whatever.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to sit in a chair just like this in Washington, DC in front of      the full senate and demand answers.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;d do it in a heartbeat.
