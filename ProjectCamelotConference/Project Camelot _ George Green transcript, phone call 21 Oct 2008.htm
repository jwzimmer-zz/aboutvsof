is Kerry Cassidy and Bill Ryan from Project Camelot,                  and we're here with George Green, hoping to get an update                  on the world today. And it's Wednesday where we are, actually,                  at 9 in the morning. And where you are, it&rsquo;s                9 at night. Is that right, George?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George                Green: That&rsquo;s correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; On                    Tuesday night. You&rsquo;re on October 21st,                  the evening, in the United States. So tell me what&rsquo;s                  going on with you.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well,                    I&rsquo;m observing the world meltdown right                  now in a lot of different directions. As you probably are aware,                  the G-8&rsquo;s meeting... everybody&rsquo;s getting together.                  And Bush went over to see Sarkozy in France. But the G-8 people                  are not willing to take the dollar as the base currency from                  now on. So they&rsquo;re postponing their meeting till after                  the election, when Obama gets in.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So what does that mean? Does that mean that our money                  isn&rsquo;t good in Europe?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; What                    they&rsquo;re                    trying to do is get a currency that they count on. Most of                    the world now is recognizing that the dollar is a dead currency,                    because they just got through putting out, as you know, another                    250 billion into the banks. And under the fractional banking                    system, that made another 2.5 trillion dollars worth                    of debt available to put out into the system. But nobody&rsquo;s                    borrowing the money. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Oh,                really.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s correct. I mean, it&rsquo;s made available,                  but everybody is concerned right now. Because not only is that                  happening, but everybody&rsquo;s being laid off. I mean, Ford                  Motor Company has laid off another 10% of their staff. That                  was today. Its stock has dropped down. All of the car companies,                  the sales are down 30 and 40%. Boeing&rsquo;s people                  that are on strike -- I understand that they may be laying                  off another 20,000 people. Nobody talks about the unemployment                  situation. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they&rsquo;re also not talking in another area, which                  is the next meltdown, and that is the derivatives area on credit                  cards throughout the world. Many credit cards right now, in                  other countries, aren&rsquo;t being accepted. As you go to                  use a major credit card, it won&rsquo;t go through. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Ah...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Because                of the banking stream.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Fascinating.                Do you know which credit cards?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; No; they&rsquo;re all being affected. It just depends                  on what the credit people are doing. I mean, even...You                  can go check it out from when the local credit people -- did                  they want to take the risk and making sure that they&rsquo;re                  going to advance money on it to the local people? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what                    they&rsquo;re doing is, they&rsquo;re just trying                  to get verification on everything. So if you&rsquo;re in a                  foreign country, like you are right now, if the hotel or stuff                  will not take your credit card, then you have to call for verification                  back. And that&rsquo;s a possibility, because that&rsquo;s                  what&rsquo;s happening all over, because most of the money                  being traded right now is digitized anyway.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Now you have the other thing that happened. As you                  know, the Iraqi government is not going to go along with the                  terms of the United States right now, and they want to delay                  till after Obama comes in, also. And that&rsquo;s because they                  want to have control and get the troops out of their country.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Oh, for sure. I&rsquo;m sure. No doubt about that.                  But I believe that&rsquo;ll never happen.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re trying to say,                  that it&rsquo;ll never happen, but remember, we&rsquo;ve been                  doing all kinds of things with the Iraqi people. So we have                  to watch the play going on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, my                    other sources are saying that when Obama gets in, within                    probably 3 to 4 months, Kerry, we have to do something, because                    the unemployment and the massive repression that&rsquo;s                  going to happen around the planet -- actually going into depression                  in many places -- is going to cause the people behind the scenes,                  in order to get something going, to begin WW III.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. Yeah. I do understand that that might be a                  tactic. What is going on with this Mutual Fund deal? Because                  didn&rsquo;t they just try to put money into propping up the                  Mutual Funds?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, it wasn&rsquo;t the Mutual Funds. You&rsquo;re                  talking about the... People were putting money into Mutual                  Funds as a backup for the money. In other words, your cash,                  you put it into a cash account and they put it in there. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what the provisions were, they said they would guarantee                  -- all these are Money Market Mutual Funds -- they would guarantee                  the Money Market Mutual Funds only for the people who had money                  in there <em>at that time.</em> Well, 12 billion dollars went                  into Money Market Mutual Funds the very next day. So there&rsquo;s                  a lot of negotiations going back and forth. So they want to                  cover that too. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that&rsquo;s everybody that&rsquo;s running around trying                  to save their assets, Kerry.

And you know                    what, the last comment they made to me -- which I thought                    was very important -- they said within six months,                  you will not recognize the dollar. So my meeting I have next                  week will be very interesting on that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Wow.                    OK. I mean, there is <em>so</em> much stuff                  going on right now. It&rsquo;s coming incredibly fast                  and furious.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; That&lsquo;s                correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; I                understand the stock market was down another 200...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; 250                points.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Now,                    the problem with the stock market is people are aware that                    their stocks are being traded. They&rsquo;re                  not aware that only a few of the stocks... In other words,                  they may be in... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let&rsquo;s                    give you an illustration: If you have 100 stocks that were                    traded, 100 different companies, they can manipulate 3 or                    4 of those companies and cause the <em>appearance</em> that                  it&rsquo;s going up. It <em>can&rsquo;t</em> shift 1,000 points                  in one day like it did without it being controlled. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the                    control mechanism is the Federal Reserve itself, through                    its &ldquo;Plunge Committee&rdquo;, which is basically some                  of the members of the, as you know, the Federal Reserve as                  well as the government itself, that are manipulating a <em>few</em> stocks                  in order to maintain what they call &ldquo;sanity&rdquo; within                  the street. Because everybody in the United States is in a                  fear mode right now. They don&rsquo;t want to buy stocks. So                  there&rsquo;s panic.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Sure.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; There&rsquo;s                    about 2.5 trillion dollars worth                  of stocks that have evaporated. If you&rsquo;re asking my professional                  opinion? I told you, I think a month ago, I said that the stocks                  would go down to about 8,500. Well, it hit the 8,500, as you                  know.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; The next level... Well, it&rsquo;s up over around                  9,000 right now, but I think with the melt-off that I&rsquo;m                  feeling from other sources... because OPEC is meeting                  because of the decline in the oil. People are not acquiring                  things like they did. I see the stock market going clear down                  to 3,500, frankly. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; 3,500?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; You                bet.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Wow.                OK. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There                    are people out there actually buying stock.

The individual person is not doing... They&rsquo;re                  just trying to save themselves. And the ones that are sitting                  by with all their 401-Ks and the rest of them, are just watching                  their assets going away. They don&rsquo;t have a lot of control                  on this.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; But                    the Mutual Funds themselves control 60% of the stocks that                  are being traded.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Oh,                    really. So it&rsquo;s                the major funds.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Exactly. The major funds. And the hedge funds right                  now, because they were always betting on the market going in                  a different direction. All of a sudden all of this is running                  away and it&rsquo;s causing them to dump <em>massive</em> amounts                  of their stocks, including their positions in gold and silver,                  and other commodities, frankly -- which is causing a whole                  drift-down. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the                    whole rest of the world&rsquo;s in the same boat.                  China&rsquo;s backing off. You know, China and Japan are still                  meeting, as you well know, on trying to figure out a new currency,                  because nobody wants to use the dollar. They want to break,                  you know, the Bretton Woods Agreement, which said that we would                  use the dollar as the &ldquo;bank currency&rdquo; and it would                  remain the level throughout the world. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, they                    don&rsquo;t want to do that any more. And that&rsquo;s                  what everybody&rsquo;s talking about. What kind of meeting                  can they have? And they all... They want to have this                  meeting after the new president gets in. That means... My                  question is: When he gets office -- when he takes office in                  January? Or after he gets through being elected? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So something&rsquo;s going to happen in the next couple of                  weeks, that we&rsquo;re going to see the changes that are happening. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile,                    the meltdown of the market&rsquo;s obviously going                  to go on. And the market represents <em>nothing</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t                  have any business at all other than trading between the brokers. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    was on national television -- they sat down with the brokers                    in New York. They didn&rsquo;t care which way the                  market&rsquo;s going, up or down, because they make money trading,                  whether selling or buying. So they&rsquo;re just having a field                  day with all this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And meanwhile, the American people -- their so-called illusion                  of equity is going away, as well as foreigners who bought into                  the drama. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening. And the derivative                  market is sold out to the entire world in various denominations.                  And they&rsquo;re not even touching the credit card derivatives.                  And that&rsquo;s going to come out in the next couple of weeks. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. When you say what&rsquo;s                    going to happen when -- I was going to say when Obama gets                  into office -- but when whoever wins gets into office.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Oh, Obama&rsquo;s already named, Kerry. I&rsquo;ve                  told you that before.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been named the next president. And he&rsquo;s                  already got the Electoral College, so we don&rsquo;t care what                  happens at this point. He&rsquo;s going to get the popular                  vote and the rest of it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well, he&rsquo;s... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; The rest of it&rsquo;s                just a show.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Do                  you think the election is going ahead, though, on schedule?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Yeah. I do. Sure. That&rsquo;s                two weeks.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                    Yeah. You know that Obama is down in Florida right now meeting                  with the former head of, what is it, the Federal Reserve?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; You                mean with Volcker?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, he may be. He&rsquo;s gonna get an education.                  First of all, he came into this thing... He&rsquo;s being                  given information by a lot of the insiders that are up close                  to the top that are trying to tell him which way to go. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know, Volcker and I actually flew together on a plane                  from Aspen back to Denver. And, you know, this man at that                  time -- of course, as chairman of the Federal Reserve, I figured                  was the most powerful man in the world -- but he just <em>represents</em> the                  most powerful men, you know, the ones that run the Federal                  Reserve.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yeah.                For sure. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; And so, when the Feds have a meeting, they&rsquo;re                  going to give him an education on trying to keep the Federal                  Reserve going. The trouble is, the Federal Reserve could collapse.                  So you&rsquo;re looking at a total collapse and a total depression,                  not recession, a depression in the United States. And the rest                  of the world&rsquo;s going to follow suit.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. OK. So what is the currency that people are                  going to be looking at in the future? Because if the dollar                  is gone, what are we looking at? We&rsquo;re looking at some                  major currency? A brand new currency for the whole world?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Yeah. Well, that&rsquo;s what... Yeah,                    a brand new currency is what the G-8 people are talking about                  right now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I mean,                    some of the data that I got later on today was talking about,                    you know, they have to do something in coordinating with                    Japan, China, and Russia. And they&rsquo;ve all said they                  do not want the dollar involved. So the United States, of course,                  is trying to push this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And remember,                    it&rsquo;s only been done by the idea that we                  would have aggression and we&rsquo;d go out...we&rsquo;re                  the most powerful people in the world... would have been                  allowed to stabilize this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, this is all coming undone <em>everywhere</em>.                    So you&rsquo;re                  asking for what the new currency is? I don&rsquo;t know what.                  That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re meeting on right now. And I&rsquo;ll                  hopefully have more of an indication next week with the senators.                  Because, like I say, they&rsquo;re involved with some of this.                  At least they have the information, you know, the stuff that&rsquo;s                  being talked behind the scenes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yeah. I bet. Well, I also wonder what&rsquo;s going                  on, you know, about their preparations for anything like martial                  law, that sort of thing. Do you think you&rsquo;re going to                  hear anything about that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, they&rsquo;re already making motions on that.                  I will know more details about that at the end of the meeting                  -- I think it&rsquo;s next Friday or Saturday -- that I&rsquo;m                  having with them. And we&rsquo;ll be discussing exactly which                  way to go. Because they&rsquo;re trying to protect the same                  thing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, my                    CIA -- the Crooks-In-Action -- friends that I have [Kerry                    laughs], you know, they&rsquo;re just totally happy                  that they&rsquo;re leaving the country or have left the country.                  They just don&rsquo;t see the United States as being a good                  place to be.

They have to do that or the banks... It&rsquo;s                  called REO, real estate owned, and if they do take the property                  back, then they have to pull back, you know, unwrap the leverage                  position they had because of the fractional reserve system. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, that&rsquo;s basically what they&rsquo;re talking right                  now, putting out money into the banks so they can continue                  to gain.

And I&rsquo;m saying                  the only way they can do is go -- what they did a couple years                  ago -- go back into bankruptcy.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So                    what about this thing where Kirkorian is selling a stake                  in Ford?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, he&rsquo;s                  getting rid of all of it because Ford is technically bankrupt.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right.                    And I understand that GM is looking for a major investor                  as well.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; General Motors is an interesting situation, because                  most of the car companies, if you look at it, got rid of most                  of their liabilities when they dumped all of the pension funds,                  all of the health benefits, on the Unions themselves. The Unions                  thought they were doing a good thing by assuming liability                  but that was upside-down. That&rsquo;s not being addressed                  to the public yet. You remember all the health benefits that                  supposedly the workers got. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But GM,                    because their sales are down 30-some percent, as you know,                    and Ford&rsquo;s 40-some percent. Will Ford exist in                  the next year? That&rsquo;s the next question. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So they&rsquo;re all trying to look at it on a world basis,                  the merger of things, and if they could come out with something                  new... Now, India&rsquo;s coming out with a new car, as                  you know, and China&rsquo;s come out with one, for $3,000! </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Oh really. OK. Well, what about the idea that&rsquo;s                  in the news today? India&rsquo;s launching an orbiter to the                  Moon. What do you think of that? What&rsquo;s that all about?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s                    just to show that they have the nuclear power and the capability.                    China and India are doing a 2-1/2-billion-dollar new project                  together. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">India has                    done two things. The United States has made an agreement,                  and they tell everybody, to put a billion-dollar reactor in                  India. But India also made the same deal with Russia. Russia&rsquo;s                  going to put in a nuclear reactor. As you know, Russia&rsquo;s                  been putting nuclear reactors all over. And this is to get                  energy. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, their                    refinery was a joint venture between China and India on their                    border, a refinery for petroleum products. Now, obviously                    with the slowdown... Now China&rsquo;s having                  a slowdown; India&rsquo;s going to have a slowdown. But these                  two countries together, as you know, China and India, represent                  almost 40% of the world&rsquo;s population. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they&rsquo;re in the position right now of not... Their                  food production and everything is able for themselves at this                  minute. So our exports -- because we&rsquo;ve been living on                  exporting our products and stuff to them -- they&rsquo;re gonna                  ignore them in this minute until we get some kind of level                  playing-field with the money. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    next two weeks, like you and I are watching, when the G-8                    meets, and if they continue the game until after a year &ndash; but                  I don&rsquo;t think they can continue past after the election,                  frankly &ndash; at that point we&rsquo;ll know which way the                  moss is going to flow. I mean, they&rsquo;re going to feel                  comfortable about it and at that point they&rsquo;ll want to                  get a new currency so they can have some kind of exchange going. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That&rsquo;s                    probably part of the reason that the Bank of International                    Settlements, as you know, a couple months ago, got permission                  from the Bush administration to audit the Federal Reserve. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are                    so many things going on behind the scenes right now. If they                    can audit the Federal Reserve... Remember,                  many congressmen have been trying to do that for many years                  right now, even Ron Paul.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So                    what does that entail? If they audit the Federal Reserve,                    what are they going to find out? Are they going to find out                  about black projects, for example? Or is this... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; They&rsquo;re going to find out that they&rsquo;re                  been... the money... the percentage games... When                  you join the franchise... Like I explained before, if                  you&rsquo;re a franchise like Best Western or Marriott or whatever,                  you pay... A percentage of the income goes back to the                  franchisee. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, the                    Federal Reserve is the franchisee. So they get a percentage                    of everything. But they&rsquo;ve got to give a fee                  back to the Bank of International Settlements. That&rsquo;s                  the bankers&rsquo; bank. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, what                    if they find out that they&rsquo;ve been lied to                  all the way? They&rsquo;re just going to shut the system down                  and now we&rsquo;re going to be in something totally new and                  nobody really knows what&rsquo;s going to come out of this.                  Like I say, we&rsquo;re going to be in a massive depression. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;m hoping people will have at least two or three months&rsquo; worth                  of food stored up. I&rsquo;m telling everybody to get cash,                  you know, a couple months in small bills &ndash; $1s, $5s,                  $10s and $20s &ndash; nothing more than that. It&rsquo;s just                  so you&rsquo;ll be able to exchange, whether or not they&rsquo;re                  gonna be worth anything. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I mean,                    there&rsquo;s some talk, with some of my other broker                  friends, they say we&rsquo;re gonna have two currencies, one                  that you can use in the United States. And something else overseas.                  Now, you know, you&rsquo;re overseas now. Will they still accept                  the dollar?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well... you know, yeah, they&rsquo;ve accepted                  it, In other words, I&rsquo;ve traded it in, you know. I traded                  in the dollar. Actually, as you know, they&rsquo;re propping                  up the dollar at the moment. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; I                    mean, the US dollar is actually worth more right now than                    the Aussie dollar, which is supposed to be a good currency                  and fairly stable. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, they&rsquo;ve done this. This is an arbitrary,                  you know, thought-provoking thing. So we&rsquo;ve got the government                  basically nationalizing all the banks, nationalizing everything                  so they can say this is a strong currency. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we                    don&rsquo;t produce anything.

Well, the people that are working for companies                  that have contracts with the government is the military-industrial                  complex, so you&rsquo;re talking about companies like Boeing                  and Northrop and so and so forth. And they are all... all                  about building war machines.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Exactly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That                will keep them going...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; And                all their stock has gone down today. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; All                of it?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; All their stock has gone down.

In                  fact, I flew in with &lsquo;em. They were talking about, well,                  they&rsquo;re probably gonna get laid off.

That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s                  eating holes in the ozone. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So radiation                    is affecting everything, but it&rsquo;s slow-moving.                  That&rsquo;s the whole basis... You can&rsquo;t have radiation                  that&rsquo;s being transmitted into people, like the crazy                  uranium [&ldquo;depleted&rdquo; uranium], as you are well aware,                  that we&rsquo;re using in shells. Yeah, it hardens the shells                  and it does things. But look at the Iraqi people!

Absolutely.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s... You know, all of these little                  pieces fit into the puzzle. And when I talk to some of my medical                  professionals, you know, on the problem, they don&rsquo;t really                  have a solution on this thing. Because this is not an instant                  thing where you kind of click on, all of a sudden, you&rsquo;re... You                  know. The cancers that are formed within your body...

Sure. The hedge funds                  are dumping to try to get liquidity, so they took big positions                  in the metal. I think that&rsquo;ll be turning around in the                  next two weeks, frankly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                    The paper versus the actual metal? Is there going to be a                  discrepancy there? Or if it goes up, will it go up everywhere?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, here&rsquo;s the problem right now... Because                  I just got, am getting, 10,000 ounces of metal and my delivery                  time is like... 2 months? Forget it! And my silver and                  my gold... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They have so many people now that are going to the metals.                  The price that they quote in New York right now is basically                  the London market, which is done by <em>paper</em> that&rsquo;s                  supposedly paper-on-deposit. Wherever they have the gold and                  stuff, they&rsquo;re selling the paper. And that&rsquo;s supposed                  to be determining the price on it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, I                    just got through paying a couple dollars over spot. I&rsquo;m buying two dollars over spot because there&rsquo;s                  none available. There&rsquo;s something wrong with this picture.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                And so...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Sure,                    they tell you that gold dropped down $20 today.

How can the price go down?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, because the hedges are dumping their prices.                  This is an arbitrary... That&rsquo;s the trouble with                  the stock market. When they have 100 shares trade in a stock,                  it determines the value of the other 2-million shares that                  are trading. See, we have an arbitrary thing that&rsquo;s being                  manipulated by these few things. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Data                    Institute -- that&rsquo;s a group of people that                  are in the gold, and they&rsquo;ve been checking and following                  this -- they&rsquo;ve been trying to get Congress to investigate                  on how they manipulate the price of gold and silver. Well,                  there&rsquo;s only so much. The silver... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;m                    about 20 miles from the Silver Valley up here, the second                    largest silver production in the continental United States,                    up here in Idaho. And I was with the president of the company,                    and we were discussing, you know, the global situation. We                    have maybe four-and-a-half-months of silver, overall, in                    reserve, to cover for the <em>world</em>. What happens in four                  months? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other                    problem is, the EPA and the rest of &rsquo;em are                  coming in and they&rsquo;re shutting down the mines because                  of what&rsquo;s happening, because the mine&rsquo;s price of                  silver is down. So we&rsquo;re going to eat this up. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s kind of like having the oil people... OPEC                  is moving in the same direction. Well, people have quit using                  it for a little bit. It won&rsquo;t be too long before you                  won&rsquo;t have the production there and, you know... I                  looked at, believe it or not, gasoline today at $2.66 a gallon.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; [laughs] So this should be good news, but in reality                  it&rsquo;s a problem. Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well... Because the next thing is, how many                  people now aren&rsquo;t paying their rent? How many people                  are out of a job? And the government is now talking about extending                  more unemployment benefits. In other words, just giving money                  out to people to go look at it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I talked                    to one of the workers that, you know, helps the senior citizens                    that can&rsquo;t take care of themselves? Some of                  these people aren&rsquo;t even getting food. I mean, it&rsquo;s                  deplorable, just listening to the stories of what&rsquo;s happening.                  The food banks are out of food, you know the ones that help                  people that go in for Food Stamps? They don&rsquo;t have any.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yeah. Absolutely. OK. We have been hearing something                  about, I don&rsquo;t know, something -- this is from a secret                  source -- saying to be very careful.

One thing, they were trying                  to get something so we could have a national emergency called.                  But I&rsquo;m concerned on two different areas on that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think                    that you&rsquo;re right.

Let&rsquo;s put it this way: She feels something&rsquo;s                  going on right now as you and I speak. And she&rsquo;s been                  talking to some other people in London that are &ldquo;friends                  like her,&rdquo; and they say the same thing: Within the next                  60 days something major&rsquo;s gonna happen. But they didn&rsquo;t                  pinpoint what was gonna happen, Kerry.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Oh                really. So... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Yeah.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So,                    are you guys planning to tactfully, possibly, exit, you know,                  stage right, so to speak?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, I have my tickets, and I was just working on                  it, to go down to Ecuador. I&rsquo;m supposed to go to a couple                  places. I was gonna come down and see you but I don&rsquo;t                  think I&rsquo;m going to make it.

Tomorrow                  I&rsquo;ll know more of my schedule. But I do have tickets                  already and I&rsquo;m planning on... you know, it&rsquo;s                  kind of family thing... but in the next four weeks I&rsquo;ll                  be down in Ecuador.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Really. OK. What do you think&rsquo;s going to go                  on as far as once Obama gets into office? Because... I                  don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve heard that actually that&rsquo;s                  not going to help matters, so to speak, as much as people think                  it is.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Oh. It&rsquo;s not. Obama will get into it. They                  want to set this whole thing up so the whole democratic thing                  all falls apart anyway. And he doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s                  getting into, frankly. I mean, he&rsquo;s being pushed to get                  in. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s kind of like, you know... Sarah Palin, once                  she got, took, the offer to become the vice president up there... They                  just got her out of the way for what she was doing up in Alaska. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; She                    was doing good for the State of Alaska.

That&rsquo;s                  right.

And the people that control... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">32 out                    of 33 of the strategic minerals in the world are located                    up in Alaska.

How do you think they get all these new                    airplanes and all these trips and all the rest of this stuff?                    It&rsquo;s                  a payoff. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    big companies continue to gain, with Alaska as big as it                    is. You don&rsquo;t realize the size of it. If you started                  from Miami and went to Seattle, that&rsquo;s about the size                  of Alaska.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yeah.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; And they don&rsquo;t                have many people up there.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s                right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; And so, meanwhile, because of what&rsquo;s happening                  on climate changes and everything else, all these mineral resources                  and the availability of having the Alaskan &ldquo;government,&rdquo; if                  you want to look at it, being very favorable to the inner group                  so they could get on and rape more of the planet, you know,                  taking the mineral resources. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sarah was stopping all that.

The Lieutenant-Governor                    up there... The Lieutenant-Governor of Alaska was just                    bought and paid for. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So now                    they put her up there and she thinks she&rsquo;s doing                  a good thing.

Well, in the case where Obama wins,                  she&rsquo;s not going to be in the game anyway. And I sort                  of think she was taken out by that family incident, where the... you                  know, he lost his job.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; No. That&rsquo;s a distraction. It was all over the                  other stuff, over the mineral resources and stuff, so they                  could get control and get her out of it. But that&rsquo;s OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                Very interesting.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s the power game. You know, absolute                  power corrupts absolutely. But if we can get you...

Always follow the money. These                  people are all manipulating. Why is Volcker having a meeting                  -- you know, the former chairman, as you say -- with Obama                  right now? Maybe he&rsquo;s gonna bring him up and say: <em>Wait                  a minute, you gotta help.

Because we had word that Hillary was                  going to be back on the ticket. And I know there&rsquo;s only                  two weeks left [until the election], so it seems absurd that                  that would happen. But I heard that health problems might crop                  up, or it could be other things.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; No. I think he&rsquo;s gonna get into office. But                  I think Hillary, and the same thing with the other players... He&rsquo;s                  just getting his Chief of Staff up there. And I&rsquo;m sure                  Hillary and Bill and the rest of &rsquo;em&rsquo;ll all be                  into some position and make a big difference. They really will.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Oh                yeah.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; You know, when you look at our dear retired general                  [Powell], he&rsquo;s already been Secretary of State for a                  couple of times. But, you know, ethically, he was just lead                  down the primrose path when they came down to the deal in Iraq                  on the whole stuff.&nbsp; But this is all part of that &ldquo;intelligence                  community&rdquo; we have out there.

The Rockefellers wanted Obama in a long                  time ago. But when you talk about Colin Powell, you know that                  he&rsquo;s moving into position to be one of his... And                  he submitted, as you know, on the meeting                  of it, because he tends to be willing to serve                  his president. So they&rsquo;ll put him into                  some position. He&rsquo;s great for working out the Middle                  East. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again,                    the wild card in this whole thing is: What are we gonna be                    dealing with?

Their government just backed                    off of all of these requirements for pulling out. And I think                    that the government&rsquo;s saying: <em>Get out                  of Iraq</em>. And they&rsquo;re waiting for Obama to get in,                  and that&rsquo;s part of the delay.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Even though they&rsquo;ve got...

It&rsquo;s over in Iraq right now.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Except my understanding is that the reasons they                  went into Iraq to begin with is because they want to guard                  that Stargate that&rsquo;s there, during the time when what                  may be Planet X comes around and/or some of the changes that                  are happening here behind the scenes with ETs and so on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, I can&rsquo;t...

You know, the Kuwaitis were slant-drilling                  underneath the Iraqi territory and they brought it in. It&rsquo;s                  all over oil for right now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Iraqi                    thing has obviously got a lot of artifacts and stuff over                    in Iraq that show the extraterrestrial connection.

The information I get is from a higher energy                  source than the Pleiadians. I mean, they&rsquo;re just kind                  of like you and I are. And most of the Pleiadians, frankly,                  I think have left. Most of &rsquo;em have left the planet.                  It&rsquo;s other extraterrestrials now that are sitting there                  rubbing their fingers, hoping we&rsquo;re going to destroy                  ourselves.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                    So what are you getting from your sources?

That one                    really said it in big spades. It said just get ready for                    the big, you know, unbridled truth that&rsquo;s coming on                    to the whole planet.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.

And he actually spoke at the <em>UFO Expo</em>,                    and I think he broke the news there. But he&rsquo;s coming                    forward saying that, you know, Nibiru is a real issue and                  that the government knows it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Oh                    sure. Well, we know that Nibiru is... Well,                  my partner, Gillian, knows all of that information on that                  and she can go into more detail than I can. And so, we&rsquo;ll                  have to get her on the air with you and you can discuss the                  whole thing.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That would be lovely. That&rsquo;d be wonderful.                  We definitely would love to do that. OK. Is there any parting                  remarks? You know. And then we want to call you back for a                  sort of a personal conversation, if you don&rsquo;t mind. But                  before we do that, are there any other remarks that you want                  to make about the current situation? Maybe words of advice                  to the Ground Crew?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, the words I have right now is just what I said                  before: Get your food stored up. If you need some appliances,                  go out and buy &rsquo;em while you can buy &rsquo;em cheap                  right now, because my friends were telling me that China&rsquo;s                  saying pay &rsquo;em in any other currency besides the dollar                  in order to get the stuff. So I&rsquo;m going to see a lot                  of goods and stuff kind of disappear off the shelves very shortly.                  And you might as well get it while you can. It&rsquo;d be for                  trading stock.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Food.                    And get yourself someplace that you can go, away from major                    cities. Because I am getting a lot of calls from people right                    now, that the military is doing some exercises in different                  places.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. We did get some information about that. We&rsquo;ve                  also got Bill Deagle talking about H5N1 -- it&rsquo;s a virus.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; The                avian flu virus. Right. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Have                you heard anything about that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; No, I didn&rsquo;t                    go into any details. Remember, when I sat in on the meetings                    when they were looking to population reduction, they said: <em>By all means necessary.</em> That&rsquo;s                  viruses, too, because they were cheaper. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new                    pulsed-beam weapons -- the ones they developed off of alien                    craft -- they&rsquo;re really looking at that, too.                  They can just basically send out a beam and shut down all electronic                  things, and everything else, and put you basically back in                  the Stone Age instantly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Wow.                OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all available at this minute. But if                  they&rsquo;re looking for population reduction in order to                  try to keep ahold of what we&rsquo;ve had as the United States                  being the most powerful one, they want to try to keep the economy                  going. I want to see how they&rsquo;re going to try to unravel                  it with the rest of the world leaders. Because they&rsquo;re                  not buying it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m sure of it. What about... There&rsquo;s                  one last thing, which is, we&rsquo;re hearing things about                  ships coming into port and not having letters of credit, so                  they&rsquo;re not able to deliver the goods. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; The letter of credit was for the goods that you&rsquo;re                  talking about? When they have the delivery, they come up and                  they can&rsquo;t get their cash. I&rsquo;ve heard that also                  from a couple of other places. In other words, the ships...                  You know, they were costing them about almost $40,000 a day                  for fuel to run these things. But the prices are down. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the                    goods they were delivering... They were given                  a letter of credit that as soon as the boat, you know, came                  up, or unloaded whatever the boat was loaded with, the letter                  of credit then would be funded. But the banks are broke.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; So what do they do? Then they go out to find somebody                  else to buy it. And if they can, the people are buying it for                  10-cents on the dollar. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard that already.                  And they&rsquo;re doing that like they do with some of the                  real estate stuff they&rsquo;re doing right now for 25- and                  30-cents on the dollar. So yeah. [laughs] It&rsquo;s a <em>big</em> meltdown,                  Kerry. That&rsquo;s all you can look at.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty worldwide. Well, I think                  that you&rsquo;re also talking about countries like Africa                  and the smaller, you know, small islands, and places in the                  third world that are going to be hit the hardest, it seems                  to me.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Well, look. These countries that you&rsquo;re talking                  about and other things that are hit the hardest because of                  the benefits that we&rsquo;ve been putting out, in other words,                  trying to help the people.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; They have no tourism, you know. A lot of these places                  aren&rsquo;t going to exist.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Look at what they&rsquo;re doing right now in Vegas.                  Right now... There&rsquo;s a whole area right now -- you&rsquo;ve                  got hotel rooms for 30 bucks a night.
