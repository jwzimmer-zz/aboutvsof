here with Jessica                Schab. Is that how you say your name?</p>                <p class="style7">Jessica Schab (J):&nbsp; Yes. That&rsquo;s correct.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And Jessica is&hellip; A <em>Crystal Child</em> is                  what she calls herself. </p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And we&rsquo;re really excited to be able to talk                  to her today. So, Jessica, tell me a little bit about yourself                  and, kind of, a little bit about your journey. And she&rsquo;s                  had a very interesting time growing up. And at this time you&rsquo;re                  about, almost 26. Is that right?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes. [nodding agreement] That&rsquo;s correct.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. So, why don&rsquo;t you tell me, like the early                  childhood kind of thing, with the relationship with your father,                  and how you sort of tapped into all of this?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; All right. I was very, very shy growing up. I actually                  didn&rsquo;t fit in, surprisingly. I didn&rsquo;t really have                  friends, of my age. I actually did have a lot of <em>grannies</em> which                  I adopted. I had 50. And they taught me how to knit and crochet                  and things like that. I retreated a lot into cartoons and&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">It really came about when I was 16. That was the big &ldquo;trigger,&rdquo; if                  you will. Before that, though, I do remember saying things                  in school like: A<em>ngels are aliens, and                  aliens are angels</em>. But&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; So, you would say this in school?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And what would be the reaction of the children around                  you?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Oh, laughter, ridicule. Yeah. Mm hm. [nodding]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And why would you say that?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; You know what? I really didn&rsquo;t know.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; It was almost like channeling, but I wasn&rsquo;t                  aware I was channeling. </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I just started sharing this information, and it was                  even before I knew what was going on with my father. So, ah,                  just thinking back to it, that&rsquo;s kind of interesting                  and different. [laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Uh huh. OK. So what happened then? I mean, obviously                  this is what you did in the early days. How did you progress                  at that point? Because I know there&rsquo;s a part at which                  you actually kind of tried to reject that world. Can you talk                  about that a little bit?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Well, yeah, because when you first get into this                  information, it brings about an existential breakdown. You                  let go of everything you think you know about yourself, and                  the world, and everybody. So it is, in a sense, a little bit                  of a death. And also a rebirth. You&rsquo;re an empty cup now,                  an empty vessel to be filled.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Be a little more specific in terms of your experience.                  Because I know that you had a tragedy in your life. But prior                  to that, because that happened kind of like in your late teens&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; You had sort of a dilemma. So, can you describe what                  your father was like, and how that dilemma kind of came &rsquo;round                  in your life?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; He was very distant. He was connected to a world                  that I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with, at the time. And he spoke                  about things that I really didn&rsquo;t understand, also. But                  he was you know, very, very, like passionate, and loving as                  well. But, um&hellip; sorry [smiling] &hellip; I&rsquo;m a                  little nervous. </p>                <p class="style7">Well, I can say, beforehand, I was always a little bit suspicious                  in school. I felt like&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t like being taught <em>what</em> to                  think rather than <em>how</em> to think. It was always in the                  back of my mind. And, also just&hellip; It kind of felt like                  I was coming off the assembly-line? And I remember trying to                  ask about things that I&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">I would notice that there was just stuff we weren&rsquo;t                  being taught about in school. For example, in Grade 8, they                  were saying the only kind of matter is gas, solid, and liquid.                  And I raised my hand and I said: <em>Well, </em>w<em>hat about                  plasma?</em> And you know what she said? <em>Go to detention.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; <em>Go to detention</em>? Really?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah. So, um&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Very interesting. And you grew up in what area?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Well, I was born in Winterpeg, [Canada] but I left                  when I was 7. And the Vancouver area, the suburbs.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; So, you were told to go to detention because you                  talked about plasma. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s, you know&hellip; I mean, so they                  actually didn&rsquo;t have any clue about that. And we&rsquo;re                  talking what year, approximately? Do you remember?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I was in Grade 8. Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; First year of high school. And I just started to                  realize: <em>Wait a second here. There&rsquo;s a lot they&rsquo;re                  not saying. And why can&rsquo;t we talk about it? Why do we                  get in trouble if we bring this stuff up?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; All right?</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; So, what happened after that?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I kinda disregarded it. Like I didn&rsquo;t really                  pay too much attention to it. It was just always in the back                  of the brain. And it&rsquo;s almost like a detective -- you&rsquo;re                  collecting all these bits and pieces as you go on the way.                  And, still very blind. </p>                <p class="style7">So we always&hellip; We have a <em>trigger</em>. And my trigger                  was when I was 16. It was tragedy. My sister ended up passing                  away. And, ah, [speaking very quietly] her friend was drinking                  and driving &ndash; and it was just my sister that went. So                  it was just her time, and&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And how did that affect you? I mean, obviously,                  you know, it&rsquo;s distressing and we don&rsquo;t have to                  dwell on it here. But, at the same time, I think that it has                  something to do with your willingness to perhaps let in these                  other worlds. Would you say that?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes, because I realized that&hellip; I was very depressed                  at that time. And I was also very Christian-thinking, in the                  sense that I felt that, you know, everybody who parties and                  does drugs and things like that is bad, and I don&rsquo;t want                  to converse with them. Not all Christians think like that,                  but that was just the way my head-space was and my interpretation                  of that.</p>                <p class="style7">So, when she passed away and I was listening to her friends                  speak about her at the funeral&hellip; They were talking about                  this wonderful girl that I never got to know because I shut                  her out, &rsquo;cause I was very judgmental. So, right then                  and there I just vowed to myself that I was never going to                  judge people by what they did. That wasn&rsquo;t who they really                  were. You know, it&rsquo;s just experiences that we come here                  for.</p>                <p class="style7">It was a very devastating time when my sister passed away,                  in that it destroyed the family. My mother ended up getting                  worse -- very bad migraines. I mean, she had migraines before,                  but they seemed to be more frequent, and lasted longer, and                  more severe. And my father ended up getting a stroke! </p>                <p class="style7">And the family broke apart. My brother went to university.                  My other brother went to a foster home. We became homeless. </p>                <p class="style7">So it was a lot, all at once. And, you know, I think I just                  became very traumatized. You know, it almost didn&rsquo;t seem                  real.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. You told me that your father had a big influence&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; &hellip;on your, sort of, letting ETs communicate                  with you.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes. [nodding agreement]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Can you talk to me about that story?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes. Right after my sister passed away, my dad said: <em>She&rsquo;s                    come back</em>. And she started to speak to him. And she                    started&hellip; she said that it&rsquo;s a very exciting                    time to be alive. <em>The universe is like a big garden.                    There&rsquo;s lots of tending here.</em> <em>I&rsquo;ve come                    back to let you know that certain members of the family have                    been called for a very specific mission.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And she was, like, the introduction towards a whole bunch                  of other beings coming through. So, after my sister started                  coming through &ndash; the catalyst &ndash; then came angels,                  nature spirits, Ascended Masters, extraterrestrials. It just                  got really, really out-there! [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. When you say this happened, did this happen to                  you? Or did this happen to your father?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; This happened to my father.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; It all happened to my father first.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; So, he&rsquo;s very open, talking to you about this?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Well, he was really shocked and taken aback, you                  know. It was exciting. And he just had to share with the family                  because he didn&rsquo;t really&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if                  he knew what to make of it at that time. But he knew that he                  needed to share this because it was a big thing to my sister. </p>                <p class="style7">The interesting thing about how she came back was&hellip; Mediums                  can only speak to people who&rsquo;ve passed away if they haven&rsquo;t <em>crossed                  over</em>. She <em>had</em> crossed over. And then she came                  right back.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. When you say she came right back, what do you                  mean by that? Do you mean she was reincarnated in another body                  and coming to you from there? Or do you mean that she was in                  another dimension?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; She was in another dimension.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes. The fifth. And my dad described her as&hellip; a                  very, very bright white light-being appeared to him. Like an                  angel. And he said it was very much her personality, because                  she&rsquo;s like: <em>Look, Dad! Don&rsquo;t I look pretty?</em> [laughing].                  Like a girl would say. So&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Uh huh.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah. It was, you know, something you gotta share.                  Something really amazing happened.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And what was your reaction when your father talked                  about this?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I was very hurt, very upset. Because she&rsquo;s                  passed away, you know? It&rsquo;s like dumping salt on this                  wound, you know? It&rsquo;s just: <em>Ha, ha. Not very funny                  at all, Dad, y</em>ou know. </p>                <p class="style7">Particularly &rsquo;cause he had a stroke. And when he had                  the stroke, he didn&rsquo;t know who we were. He couldn&rsquo;t                  work. You know, I felt like I lost my father. And so, now to                  talk about something like this, you know&hellip; <em>You&rsquo;re                  crazy. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about!</em> </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; So he had these experiences <em>after</em> he had                  the stroke, is what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah. So I thought&hellip; [points with her left                  index finger upward]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; He must have recovered fairly well, though, to be                  able to communicate. I mean, he didn&rsquo;t have, like, speech                  impairment or anything like that from the stroke?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; He did, a bit. Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; But he was able to communicate this to you?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Uh huh.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Mm hm. [nodding agreement]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. So you rejected it in the beginning. What made                  you change your mind?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; A lot of things. </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; It was not something that I was gonna quickly be                  open to because I really, really wanted to be <em>normal</em>.                  Hmm. And it was never going to happen.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I just had to&hellip; It took me a while to get to                  that. But, ah, he wanted to tell me about his experiences,                  and all these beings that were coming through, and what they                  were saying. And they were talking a lot about me.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; [laughs] And I did not know what to think of this.                  I really wanted <em>nothing</em> to do with it. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, I would just go to the library or the book store,                  and books would start falling off the shelf, with the same                  kind of context, information, that these beings were speaking                  to my dad about. They&rsquo;d fall right at my feet! </p>                <p class="style7">And again, I was still very Christian-thinking, so I&rsquo;m                  like: <em>This is the devil.</em> So I just ran out, freaked                  out. And it was funny that&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; How did you get over that, though, if you were such&hellip; if                  you had this mind-set that was Christian thinking? How did                  you sort of move beyond that?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;ll get into that. That&rsquo;s coming                  up. </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; So, I would just, you know, go walking down the street                  and people would come up to me, people I knew and people I                  didn&rsquo;t know. And they would hand me the books! Again                  -- same kind of information that&hellip; like the ones that                  my dad was talking about, similar to the context of the books                  in the library and bookstore.</p>                <p class="style7">And what was interesting thing about this is, some of the                  people, when I asked: <em>Why are you giving me this book of</em>&hellip;?                  You know? And they&rsquo;re like: <em>I don&rsquo;t know.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">How do you <em>not</em> know why you&rsquo;re giving somebody                  a book? Unless you&rsquo;re being inspired?</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; And I, still, would not look at the books. And so,                  it required those beings to be even more persistent. I like                  to call it &ldquo;Angelic Kick in the Butt.&rdquo;</p>                <p class="style7">Where I was working&hellip; I&rsquo;d been working in the                  film industry. Right after my sister passed away, I left school                  because my parents&hellip; they were just, you know, they weren&rsquo;t                  able to work. So I decided that, you know: <em>We go to school                  to learn how to make money. I&rsquo;m out of school. I&rsquo;m                  out of this.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And I went into the film industry right away. My very first                  day of &ldquo;extra&rdquo;, work I got lines. And so I thought                  that was normal. [laughs] The next day, I&rsquo;m like: <em>When                  do I get my lines?</em> And they&rsquo;re like: <em>You don&rsquo;t!</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So&hellip; ah, where was I going with that?</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; So, what happened? What did you do then? You didn&rsquo;t                  get lines. Are you saying you just became an extra?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I did extra work. I did acting, I did stunts. I did                  stand-in. I did crew work.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Set dec. [ed. note: Set decoration.] I did as many                  different things, to remove politics, and understand where                  everybody was coming from. That was something that I always                  was interested in doing, is learning all the different perspectives,                  and&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And so, when did the transition happen, where                  you started to listen to what your father said?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; On set, on a show called <em>Da Vinci&rsquo;s Inquest</em>,                  a guy came up to me I&rsquo;d never seen in my entire life.                  And he said to me: <em>Is your name Jessica?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And I said: <em>Mm hm.</em> [nodding her head in agreement] </p>                <p class="style7">He said: <em>Is your last name Schab?</em> </p>                <p class="style7"><em>Yeah.</em> </p>                <p class="style7"><em>And is your parents&rsquo; name Roseanne and Terry?</em> </p>                <p class="style7"><em>Yeah.</em> <em>How do you know all this?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And he&rsquo;s like: <em>OK. This is for you.</em> And he                  gave me all these tapes on the CIA, underground militia, David                  Icke, Jordan Maxwell, Alex Collier, and then some. [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp;&nbsp; And I just kind of realized that this is never                  going to let up. Something is trying to get my attention and                  I have to surrender.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Did you watch those tapes?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I did.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And did it change you?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Um, I became very, very depressed. Even more so.                  Because&hellip; again, letting go of everything you think you                  know. But then, also it seems to be this huge, scary conspiracy,                  like we&rsquo;re doomed. It&rsquo;s, you know, this huge control                  game going on, and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it,                  because you don&rsquo;t have the power, or the money, or <em>say</em>,                  in a sense.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And so, what did you do then? How did you go from                  there to actually listening to your father?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Hmm. Well, after the videos, and after feeling the                  way I did about them, and just constant reoccurring of Pleiadians<em>&hellip; </em>You                  know: <em>OK, Dad, who are the Pleiadians? Why do they want                  to get in contact with me?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So I started finding out now, really listening to my dad.                  And I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily open to it, but I wasn&rsquo;t                  necessarily closed. I was just thinking that, ah&hellip;: <em>This                  is my experience. For whatever reason, life has taken this                  turn, and it&rsquo;s for a reason. So I should&hellip; I should                  do some investigating.</em></p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And how old were you at this time?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I&rsquo;d say about 17. Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; A year later. And my dad actually started to talk                  about his experiences, that he actually was aware of this stuff                  before his stroke. It was just a bigger upgrade for him. </p>                <p class="style7">But I found out that when he was 8, he was taken up on a UFO,                  and the whole family on the farm saw this as well. And they                  put a chip in his brain? And this chip&hellip; he didn&rsquo;t                  believe that it was actually there. He thought it was a dream                  or something until ah, not too long ago. </p>                <p class="style7">Before his stroke, I believe that he mentioned, he was in                  the hospital. And there was a woman there that&hellip; Well,                  she seemed to be a nurse, but she wasn&rsquo;t, &rsquo;cause                  she went up to my dad right away and she said: <em>You have                  to leave</em>. She brought him his clothes. She said: <em>If &ndash; they&rsquo;re                  planning on scanning your brain. If they scan your brain, they&rsquo;ll                  find the chip.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And my dad&rsquo;s like: W<em>ait a second! That&rsquo;s real?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And she said: <em>This cannot happen. So, come on. It&rsquo;s                    time to go.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">But my dad actually didn&rsquo;t get out on time. So, right                  when they were about to scan his brain, the whole hospital                  had a blackout. And when the power went back on, the CAT-scan                  machine didn&rsquo;t work. And then, when it did work, it worked                  on everybody but him. And that gave him enough time to make                  his escape from the hospital.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. Very interesting. So&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Now, this woman&hellip; Did she disappear? Was she                  still on the&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah, she disappeared. My dad went back to find,                  you know, who&hellip; if he could speak to her again. And she                  was only there that one time. She completely vanished.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. </p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s been a few, actually, events like                  that where&hellip; These people would come to our door and                  my dad would say: <em>Jess, go follow them.</em> And I did.                  And they just vanished! [shrugs and raises hands]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; They just vanished?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah. Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; So he&rsquo;d say: <em>Follow them</em>?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Right into thin air. I&rsquo;d turn the corner and                  I&rsquo;d see them&hellip; Poof&rsquo;! </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; And my dad, he would have experiences where&hellip; He                  could see these beings all the time. He would be in a parking                  lot and suddenly all these angels would be surrounding him.                  So he had many experiences like that. And he always tried to                  interpret it and explain it to us, which was very, very fascinating.                  It started to become, you know: <em>OK. Wow. Something is going                  on here.</em> And, um&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; What did your father do for a living before he had                  a stroke?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; My father was a businessman. He had his own company                  called Beverly Hill Homes, which he ran with my mother, and                  it was very successful. And then&hellip; He was a master of                  many things, a jack-of-all-trades. In Winterpeg, he built houses.                  He designed them, architecture-wise, and he also put it together,                  carpentry. And they were very beautiful homes, as well. One,                  of which I have fond memories, is the Castle House.</p>                <p class="style7">And he also was a chemist. He invented &ldquo;mendable concrete,&rdquo; like&hellip; Because                  he was very honest and trustworthy, he ended up getting taken,                  and somebody stole that idea and took it to China. And that                  really devastated my mother. They ended up losing all their                  money, really having nothing. And then my father, through the                  latter years, he made furniture, cutesy kind of furniture.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; So, you&rsquo;re in this situation. Your sister has                  passed.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; You&rsquo;re learning about ETs&hellip; And what                  happened that actually sort of progressed you to where it wasn&rsquo;t                  just your father having experiences but you started to have                  them?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; OK. Wow. Well, while I started to learn about the                  ETs, I&rsquo;m still&hellip; I&rsquo;m actually really still                  upset with my father because he left the church and I was still                  kinda Christian at that time. Right? Trying to hold onto this!                  And so, I kept going to different churches and I felt really                  annoyed because I couldn&rsquo;t find one where I fit in.</p>                <p class="style7">And so I decided to explore different religions. And I went                  to those churches; still didn&rsquo;t quite fit in. There was&hellip; Something                  felt off, and I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on it. So then                  I went into mysticism because this seemed to be along the lines                  of what my dad was talking about, of what it seemed these beings                  were trying to relay to me. But still that didn&rsquo;t quite                  feel right and I didn&rsquo;t quite fit in.</p>                <p class="style7">And I knew that to try to&hellip; I knew that one day I would                  be explaining this to people. So I decided to even explore                  atheism. Again, same thing, I still didn&rsquo;t quite fit                  in. But there still&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">I couldn&rsquo;t deny any of them, either, because they all                  seemed to be pieces of myself. So what I did was, I started                  to embrace all of them. And I realized that I&rsquo;m not just                  one, and to pigeon-hole myself into one is a great disservice.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; So these new insights started coming through. This                  is really where I started to see the world very differently.                  And everyday, little, things started to become really big. </p>                <p class="style7">For example, one time I came home and I was very upset about                  this reoccurring problem &ndash; like: <em>Why does this keep                  happening to me?</em> And, it&rsquo;s funny, I don&rsquo;t                  even know what it is to this day. So, really big? Right? [laughing]</p>                <p class="style7">But, it popped into my head: <em>Boggle. Go get the game,                    Boggle</em>. I&rsquo;m like: <em>Huh? Boggle? What the heck                    does that have to do with anything?</em> [Kerry laughs] That&rsquo;s                    kind of a weird, random tangent. </p>                <p class="style7">But, I went and got it. And then I got, you know: <em>Shake                    it up, find some words</em>. And I found like ten. And I&rsquo;m                    like: <em>All right. Well, that&rsquo;s done, and I don&rsquo;t                    really understand the point of this.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And when I put it down, I got up and I turned around, and                  I saw the board from another angle? And I saw all these other                  words I didn&rsquo;t see before. I&rsquo;m like: <em>Wait a                  second. </em>AndI walked around. I saw, you know, more from                  the other angle, and more from the other angle, till I found,                  I think, 55. </p>                <p class="style7">And then it said: <em>OK. Well now you know why this problem                    keeps reoccurring. You&rsquo;re only looking at it from one                    perspective, one angle.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">I was like: <em>Oh my goodness! Wow! </em>And:<em> Where did                    this come from?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And then it just popped into my head: <em>Allow us to introduce                    ourselves. We are your guides.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And every time I tried to ask them who exactly they were,                  I got a different answer. And so I thought at one point they                  were playing with me. But, in a sense, they didn&rsquo;t wanna                  be locked into labels. In the beginning, you know, we introduced                  myself as a <em>Crystal Child</em>. But, you know, there&rsquo;s <em>Indigo,                  Light-Worker, Star-Seed</em>. And also just <em>Jessica</em>.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Uh huh.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Right? So, they&rsquo;re all labels. When it comes                  down to it, they&rsquo;re all pieces of ourself. </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I mean, in school I was always told that I was stupid,                  and I believed it.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; What? When you say you were told you were stupid,                  who told you that?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; My teachers. Why? Because I was put in the special                  classes -- a &ldquo;slow learner.&rdquo; [drawing quotation                  marks in the air] And the students. And because I was very                  dyslexic and I learned very differently&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; &hellip; and I couldn&rsquo;t see things the way                  they did. And also I didn&rsquo;t have an interest to. It&rsquo;s                  just so boring, you know? This is not going to stimulate the                  soul, you know? It starves that part of us.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. So&hellip; but to get back to your story. You&rsquo;re                  in a position where you&rsquo;re starting to hear from your                  guides. You&rsquo;ve heard stories from your father. </p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Mm hm. [nodding agreement]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; So at what point were you actually sort of convinced                  that possibly what he was seeing was real, and those personages                  started to be appearing for you, or become real, for you?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; They never quite, like, appeared to me in the way                  my dad&rsquo;s did. But, I just started&hellip; Like what I                  was sharing with&hellip; in school about being told I was stupid.                  It stayed like that until, you know&hellip; That was my paradigm.                  That&rsquo;s what everybody saw me as.</p>                <p class="style7">Until one day it dawned on me that, you know, someone&rsquo;s                  opinion of me doesn&rsquo;t have to be my reality. And when                  that happened, everything shifted. Nobody saw me as stupid                  anymore. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean I still don&rsquo;t have                  that part. Like, these are all facets of what makes us human.                  So I couldn&rsquo;t really judge anybody anymore because I                  saw myself in each one of them, no matter what they did.</p>                <p class="style7">And what really took it to the next level, actually, was [hesitantly] &hellip; um&hellip; This                  is very, very hard to share. But it&rsquo;s very important                  to share. </p>                <p class="style7">Even though I was starting to become open to it, I was still                  very upset with my dad. Because what I wanted more than anything                  was just a normal Dad, and&hellip; to be a father, and not                  to be lost to this world, even though it was exciting. You&rsquo;re                  still a child. And you need that kind of support. So, I might                  get a bit emotional about saying this&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; On Christmas day, the whole family was around, and                  I just felt so hurt and upset by my dad that I told him: <em>I                  hate you. Why don&rsquo;t you just die, already?</em> And he                  did.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Umm, and I&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; You say he did. Can you be a little more specific                  as to how? What happened?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; A week later he had a brain hemorrhage, and he went                  in for brain surgery. And he didn&rsquo;t recover.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. So how did you, sort of, view that experience?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Well, I knew about how our thoughts create reality                  before <em>What the Bleep</em> came out. This information was                  being given to me by my dad&rsquo;s &ldquo;being&rdquo;, since                  I sat, you know, and listened to what they were saying. I knew                  that there&rsquo;s a huge responsibility to what we&rsquo;re                  putting out, and how powerful it is, that in a sense it <em>is</em> magic.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; So when I said that, I was so wracked with guilt,                  and so mad at myself, and so upset with these beings who were                  working with me. I felt that they chose the wrong person to                  do this mission, because I demonstrated myself as unworthy.                  You get told that this is the power that you have: <em>Your                  thoughts create, </em>you know,<em> your reality. Pay attention                  to them.</em> And then you go and do something like that, in                  so seeming unconscious measure.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. But did you also allow for the freedom of the                  other person? Their&hellip; sort of as a sovereign entity?                  In other words, that person being your father, having a choice                  in whether to die or not?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t see that until later on. See, what                  happened was, I didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with the beings                  after that, just because I felt so hurt by what I did that                  I&hellip; like unworthy, like I said. But they still wouldn&rsquo;t                  leave me alone. </p>                <p class="style7">And they said: <em>You don&rsquo;t understand, You&rsquo;re                    only seeing it from one perspective, you know. You&rsquo;re                    feeling very hard on yourself and it&rsquo;s not necessary.                    You don&rsquo;t understand on the soul level what&rsquo;s                    occurring. Even though you told him out of anger what you                    told him, on a soul level you said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,                    Dad. You can go now. We&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And that I had a contract with him that I would help him go                  when the time came. And that he did want to leave, but he didn&rsquo;t                  want to go unless he knew that we would be OK. And I did just                  that.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. So you were able to kind of forgive yourself                  and allow for that occurrence to happen, and to have been part                  of your reality, in other words?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes. Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And what about the rest of your family? How did                  they view his passing, at that point?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; It devastated my mother. My mother still hasn&rsquo;t                  recovered from it. My oldest brother just distanced himself                  away from the family, like&hellip; &rsquo;Cause he witnessed                  that. I don&rsquo;t know if he even forgives me to this day                  of what I said to Dad, because he can&rsquo;t understand or                  see it the way I do now. </p>                <p class="style7">My other brother&hellip; he was upset with Dad, too. So, he                  actually talked about, you know, just not being happy with                  Mom being with Dad. And Steve was too young to really know                  what was going on.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. So your father passed on and you were having                  some interactions with various beings and getting information.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; But what happened after that? Did it increase? Did                  you&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Oh yeah. It just kept increasing nonstop. I just                  had to keep&hellip; I felt very, very guided, suddenly, after                  my dad passed away, that he planted a whole bunch of seeds                  within me, and I needed to take care of all these seeds now.                  I needed to make sure they had light and water and&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Were you sharing your experiences with your family?                  Or was this just private?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I could only really share it with my mother. The                  other siblings were not open to it at all.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And what about school? Friends? School mates?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; No others, nobody I had at that time. So that&rsquo;s                  why I went on the computer, trying to find people who&hellip; <em>Somebody                  must have had similar experiences! Someone must know about                  this. I can&rsquo;t be the only one! Not just my family! I                  mean, these videos, you know&hellip; David Icke, Alex Collier.                  They, you know, talk to other people. They find them. So perhaps                  I can do the same.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And how many people is this happening to who feel alone, you                  know? Who can&rsquo;t share this because they feel, you know,                  crazy? Or they won&rsquo;t be understood? And that&rsquo;s                  really sad and not fair. You know, we have the right to share                  and express what is within us.</p>                <p class="style7">So that really drove me. And I spent many nights trying to                  find others, to no avail. Until one night I collapsed in front                  of the computer. And when I woke up, there&hellip; It was in                  the middle of the night too. There was this, on the computer                  screen. It&rsquo;s just, like: &ldquo;Meet other Star-Seeds                  and Light-Workers&rdquo;. I was like: <em>Ohhhh&hellip; </em>[big                  smile] <em>I hit the mother lode!</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And I contacted them all. And we immediately had a strong                  connection, like we&rsquo;ve known each other all our lives.                  And I just knew so much about them. And I didn&rsquo;t really                  know how, but it just was so strong. </p>                <p class="style7">And it became very exciting, and I decided I wanted to go                  and see them. And so I just started to. </p>                <p class="style7">It kind of freaked my mother out, because the first one I                  wanted to meet was, of all things, a guy. You know, a male                  around my age. And you think that, if they&rsquo;re open to                  this information, that they might&hellip; They must be The                  One! They&rsquo;re near your age, opposite sex. That&rsquo;s                  all you need!</p>                <p class="style7">So I told my mom I&rsquo;m going to France to meet this guy                  I&rsquo;ve never met but I&rsquo;m in love with. And I&rsquo;m                  going, even though I know that it&rsquo;s going to cost about&hellip; like                  everybody&rsquo;s telling me three grand, you know, minimum.                  I said<em>: I&rsquo;m going to go for less than $900.</em> And                  I did. </p>                <p class="style7">When I called the travel agent, she said: <em>We have nothing                    available &ndash; Oh, except this&hellip; It just popped                    up. It looks like somebody cancelled for three weeks, for,                    what was it now? $850.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Yeah. I&rsquo;m like: <em>That was the one. That&rsquo;s the                    one.</em></p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And you&rsquo;ve also done this now&hellip; you&rsquo;ve                  sort of followed this kind of pattern since then&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes!</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; &hellip;in allowing things to come to you, and knowing&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes!</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; &hellip;sort of having a second sense about that?                  Is that right?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yeah. It&hellip; just a strong trusting. The guidance                  just directs you. It&rsquo;s like the White Rabbit from <em>Alice                  in Wonderland.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what it feels like. So you just know                  what to do, and that you&rsquo;ll be fine, you know, and you                  can make it happen. I can use all of this stuff that I&rsquo;ve                  been taught, to reverse a lot of the old condition-programming                  that is put on us when we&rsquo;re younger. Right?</p>                <p class="style7">And it&rsquo;s like&hellip; It&rsquo;s NLP [ed. note: Neuro-linguistic                  Programming] in a sense, programming your old beliefs and your&hellip; if                  they&rsquo;re <em>yours</em>, or where they came from, and                  using them to step into your power more and more, and seeing                  what you can do. </p>                <p class="style7">If these beings say that we&rsquo;re infinite, you know, and                  that we&rsquo;re these beautiful balls of light, then I want                  to experience this. I want to feel this. And you can&rsquo;t                  just read about it. You have to embody it, is what I&rsquo;ve                  come to realize. And not praying or wishing or hoping for peace                  and love anymore -- I&rsquo;ve decided to become it. </p>                <p class="style7">You know, it comes to a point in life where you decide: Do                  you want to <em>go</em> home, or <em>become</em> home? And                  then: Will that bring home to everybody within? That&rsquo;s                  what &ldquo;The Shift&rdquo; feels like to me.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; What I was wondering now, if you could talk a little                  bit about the messages that you were getting? And the kind                  of beings that were coming to you, if you could describe them?                  Maybe specific ones that have particular meaning for you.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s never been quite specific. Like                  I said, they&rsquo;ve always&hellip; Just when I thought I                  could pinpoint it: <em>OK. It&rsquo;s a Pleidi&hellip;</em> No,                  it would be something different suddenly. So it was never quite                  about attaching: <em>OK. This is Jesus. This is Buddha.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">It was never about that. It was about the fusion and merging                  all of them together and that being God in itself. Right? Playing                  all these roles and speaking to us in whatever comfort-belief                  that we had. So that was always my approach and perspective                  on it, even when understanding what these aliens were &ndash; pieces                  of ourself as well.</p>                <p class="style7">And so, what I started to do was not only test the stuff out                  on my life&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t mind sharing those experiences &rsquo;cause                  they&rsquo;re quite wild and really fun, especially when people                  start trying it out for themselves, and then calling me up                  later, going: <em>Oh my goodness</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">But, for example, what I found with the extraterrestrials                  is, if time doesn&rsquo;t exist -- past present or future are                  all existing at the same time simultaneously -- and this is                  an illusion, in a sense time is just a bunch of still-frames.                  [makes a square with her hands] And this camera, you know,                  it&rsquo;s not really moving. It&rsquo;s just a bunch of still-frames. </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Mm hm.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s a trick of the eye. Such is the case                  going on within our mind as well, making us perceive.</p>                <p class="style7">Then, if we&rsquo;ve been taught to believe about time &ndash; linear,                  the way we do now -- then that means there&rsquo;s aspects                  of ourself that is fragmented, so future versions of ourself,                  depending on the probability of our thinking. </p>                <p class="style7">So, for example, the Grays -- not saying all Grays are like                  this -- but when I learned that they actually aren&rsquo;t                  gray at all, that, on a crash, they dissected them and found                  that their gray skin was actually our color. And those big                  goggles, those big eyes &ndash; That&rsquo;s what they were:                  they were goggles. They were a future version of ourself that,                  you know&hellip; They <em>feel</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">When people feel them, they feel very cold and kind of calculated.                  And it&rsquo;s almost like that version of ourself, of the                  collective thinking about, you know, the desensitization of                  war, and all this cloning and genetic engineering. And the                  chemicals in the air made us a little bit disconnected from                  who we really were. </p>                <p class="style7">Because, you know, some people say that they, you know, they                  don&rsquo;t really <em>feel</em>, they don&rsquo;t have emotions                  in that sense. And that&rsquo;s an aspect of ourself. And I                  would wonder why those ones would&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">If you ask any little kid to draw a picture of an alien, it&rsquo;d                  always be the Grays with the big eyes. And what I got from                  them was that they came back to kind of prevent us from going                  down that path.</p>                <p class="style7">And it sounds very bizarre. How can, you know, something from                  the future come back to us if time travel doesn&rsquo;t even                  exist? </p>                <p class="style7">But if an old man has smoked his entire life and he has a                  hole in his throat because of it, a lot of the times they get                  inspired to go to an elementary school to talk to the kids                  and say: <em>Please don&rsquo;t smoke or you&rsquo;ll end up                  like me.</em> And that&rsquo;s kind of what I saw with the                  Grays.</p>                <p class="style7">So, then I&rsquo;m like: <em>Now I&rsquo;m going to play with                    the other races. What about the reptiles? Why are people                    seeing reptiles?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And for me, everything at first exists within. What happens                  inside of us gets mirror-reflected outside. There is a war                  going inside of our mind, hence a war going on outside. Even                  our body mirrors this in that. What is cancer, really, but                  one cell not recognizing another cell that&rsquo;s on the same                  team? And so they fight. </p>                <p class="style7">Well, that&rsquo;s exactly what&hellip; You know, the Americans                  and the Iraqis and&hellip; It&rsquo;s been played out over                  and over. And that&rsquo;s why the Buddhists were always saying,                  you know, peace of mind, meditation, clarity, because&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">Oh my goodness! I&rsquo;m gonna not go on tangents! I&rsquo;ve                  got to watch out for that.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. Well, don&rsquo;t worry. It has a through-line.                  But what I wanna know is, when you&rsquo;re talking in this                  way, are you talking about information that has come to you&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; &hellip;or the information you&rsquo;ve read on the                  internet?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; No.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Are you putting these two together?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; [shaking her head negative] No. I couldn&rsquo;t                  really read or study this information that much. More that                  just honestly came to me. If I did try to read, I would get                  other stuff coming to me. It was almost like, whoever inspired                  the person in writing the literature, they were speaking through                  me. </p>                <p class="style7">You know, in acting there&rsquo;s the sub-text, reading in-between                  the lines? A whole other message behind it. And that&rsquo;s                  kinda what I was always picking up. </p>                <p class="style7">I could never read or watch movies the same way as everybody                  else. I never <em>got</em> what everybody else got. I always                  got something completely different. I never saw things like                  everyone else, so&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, that&rsquo;s like even with reptiles. I don&rsquo;t                  see them like everybody else does. I see them as a manifestation                  within our mind because of the reptilian brain. That&rsquo;s                  where the ego is, and where 90% of the negative self-talk comes                  from, and the repetition, and that controlling factor in our                  mind.</p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t even see the ego as something bad. I see it                  as something that is desperate for our attention and feels                  like it has a duty to keep us safe. And it&rsquo;s doing a                  good job, but to the point where now it&rsquo;s making reasons                  why we need it. And now we need protection from the protection,                  which is mirror-reflected in our society, with our system,                  you know. It was there for protection.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Now we need protection from that. Even the Pleiadians&hellip; They&rsquo;re                  another mirror reflection of ourself in the future. If we step                  into our potential, our infinite potential, then we&rsquo;ll                  have that reality probability manifested for us. </p>                <p class="style7">So there&rsquo;s all these [gesturing] laid out for us. And                  it&rsquo;s really up to each one of us, by the inner work that                  we do. And we&rsquo;re responsible, because we are our own                  self-fulfilling prophecy. That&rsquo;s what humanity is, and                  they&rsquo;ve been <em>played</em>.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And what is your view if&hellip; In other words                  when the entities&hellip; ah &hellip; I guess I wanna say,                  when the entities come to you&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Uh huh.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; &hellip;and they give you information, do you just                  accept it?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; No. We have a conversation, almost like. I challenge                  them. I always like to challenge them and play with them, because                  that seems to be what really stimulates them coming about --                  in touch with your inner child, you know, and that creativity. </p>                <p class="style7">And wanting to understand why they&rsquo;re bringing this                  about. You know: <em>Why are you sharing this? What is your                  intent behind it?</em> And I&rsquo;ve been able to filter,                  right away, ones that are trying to sway, by how they make                  you feel about yourself and the world around you: Do you feel                  afraid, and that you need to, you know, protect yourself? Or                  do you feel more liberated and more compassionate and loving?</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s how you can decipher through any                  message, whatever thing you&rsquo;re watching.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And are you finding that certain beings return                  to you more than once? Would you recognize them? Or are you                  talking about a general, you know, sort of &ldquo;heading,&rdquo; you                  know, called &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; or &ldquo;guides&rdquo;,                  or whatever you want to call it.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I prefer to use that, even though, yeah, they are                  just facets of myself, or you, everybody.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Right. But given that they are&hellip; If you want                  to look at it that way, in terms of&hellip; You know, we can                  always look at the world in that terminology, but they still                  have individuality, to some degree.</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve never really focused on that. That                  never really interested me so much, because, to me, that seemed                  to be a bit of a distraction. I mean, if we&rsquo;re thinking                  about&hellip; We argue a lot about Jesus, whether he&rsquo;s                  real or not. And it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. It was the                  message. That&rsquo;s the bigger picture. So that&rsquo;s always                  what I paid attention to. </p>                <p class="style7">And I&rsquo;m like: <em>Well, even Luke Skywalker&hellip; he&rsquo;s                    not real, but boy does he inspire and reach a lot of people.</em> So                    that was always the way I would get past all these things,                    just to get right to the focal point, for me.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. So what did they tell you your mission was? Do                  you know?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Mmm. It&rsquo;s&hellip; When you&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t                  really exist. When you can&rsquo;t, you know, go out and find                  a place that says: <em>This is just for Jessica</em>, then                  it&rsquo;s a little bit challenging. </p>                <p class="style7">So it was something that they said that I can create. I can                  create, with the pieces of what I&rsquo;m acquiring, how I                  see my perspective, to share that with the world. And that                  is&hellip; but don&rsquo;t just talk about it, like be it,                  and inspire people to find their own truth.</p>                <p class="style7">Not to say, you know: <em>You need to believe what I believe &rsquo;cause                    I&rsquo;m right and everybody else is wrong. </em>But to                    honor where each one is coming from, and to trust themself,                    that they have those answers within, that we don&rsquo;t                    need to necessarily look and depend on other people for the                    answers. </p>                <p class="style7">Because that&rsquo;s kind of what got us into this mess in                  the first place. Right? We&rsquo;re giving our power away to                  people or beings that don&rsquo;t necessarily have our best                  intention in mind. </p>                <p class="style7">But even that, we should ask: <em>Why don&rsquo;t they? Where                    does that come from?</em> <em>What part of ourself is so                    self-destructive that allows us to do this to ourselves?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. If you were going to talk about the future&hellip; And,                  you know, a lot of people are talking about 2012, as you know,                  and what may be going on in the future. Have you been given                  any visions or dreams of the future, or any information about                  it from the beings that are contacting you?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Definitely. A lot. And I always like to dispense                  with this &ldquo;End of the World&rdquo; kind of thing. But                  I can understand why people see, or are perceiving it, as the                  end of the world, because it&rsquo;s the end of an old way                  of living, being, and thinking, that has been around for quite                  some time. So, to a lot of people who don&rsquo;t have imagination,                  who can&rsquo;t see beyond that, then to them it&rsquo;s the                  end.</p>                <p class="style7">But in actuality it is something far beyond what we&rsquo;ve                  ever dreamed. In a sense, the best way to understand it is,                  you know, &ldquo;Truth is stranger than fiction&rdquo;. </p>                <p class="style7">And we are going to experience that first-hand with these &ldquo;paranormal&rdquo; events                  which aren&rsquo;t even <em>para-</em>normal at all. It&rsquo;s                  just a bleed-through of who we actually are, coming out in                  all kinds of different ways. It&rsquo;s going to be more and                  more frequent. And people are gonna start just recognizing                  each other. </p>                <p class="style7">And war cannot continue because we&hellip; If I harm you,                  right away I&rsquo;m going to feel that pain. So, say I punched                  you in the shoulder? I&rsquo;m gonna feel it right away in <em>my</em> shoulder.                  And it&rsquo;s going to freak people out at first &rsquo;cause                  we&rsquo;ve never really been&hellip; Like nobody&rsquo;s really                  taught this to us in school, you know. It&rsquo;s kind of hush-hush.                  It&rsquo;s taboo in the world, but it&rsquo;s starting to come                  back.</p>                <p class="style7">Humanity&rsquo;s, you know, in their state of amnesia for                  such a long time, and now just awakening to what we&rsquo;ve                  always known. And it&rsquo;s very quantum. It&rsquo;s very                  multidimensional. It&rsquo;s memories, not just of past lives,                  but future lives, multi-dimensional lives, inter-dimensional                  lives, lives in between lives. We&rsquo;ll be able to grasp                  that and understand that. </p>                <p class="style7">Right now what&rsquo;s happening is, it&rsquo;s just stepping-stones                  that&rsquo;s leading us there. And you can&rsquo;t get attached                  or box yourself into one belief. There are no limits, just                  beliefs. So you always got to expand on that.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. So when you say past lives, future lives&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Mm hm. [nodding agreement]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; &hellip;etcetera, have you been given a vision of                  your own past lives, future lives? Are you saying that this                  is something that you think is going to be revealed to you                  eventually?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t have very many past lives per se because                  I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I know I&rsquo;ve been human on this                  planet. Mainly I&rsquo;ve been a guide working on the etheric.                  So I&rsquo;m here to help people understand their guides and                  the mechanics of how they work, and all the ways they&rsquo;re                  trying to get through to us and relay their message. And so,                  that&rsquo;s&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">My past lives: I&rsquo;ve had one in Atlantis and one in France.                  So, not very many. It is very bizarre to be in a human body                  and just getting used to the physical, and the matter kind                  of thing. But it&rsquo;s a huge honor to be in the physical                  form on Earth at this time. </p>                <p class="style7">And I&rsquo;ve been taken&hellip; and I&rsquo;ve seen this                  line-up of souls that just can&rsquo;t wait to be here on Earth                  at this time. And that&rsquo;s actually why the planet is over-populated.                  It&rsquo;s because of the excitement from all the souls. </p>                <p class="style7">And this planet is like a Harvard University for Creators-in-Training.                  And it&rsquo;s one of the greatest honors to be in physical                  form during this time, because it&rsquo;s the merge of spirit                  and matter working together, and going, and having these kinds                  of experiences. </p>                <p class="style7">Because it&rsquo;s very different&hellip; I mean, I can speak                  about this other side. I can explain to you how they interpret                  us. It&rsquo;s almost like we are a &ldquo;reality show&rdquo; to                  them. And what we do affects them, as well. It&rsquo;s like                  a huge ripple effect. It&rsquo;s all a microcosm of a macrocosm,                  as we step into that.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. So can you talk about specific events in the                  future? Or is it completely unwritten, in your view?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not necessarily specific events, because                  it&rsquo;s&hellip; again, it&rsquo;s on the collective term.                  But I just&hellip; whenever I think about it or tap into it,                  I just see a very different world from here. </p>                <p class="style7">I see people more connecting with nature, understanding the                  wisdom that&rsquo;s there that, you know, that&hellip; It&rsquo;s                  never lied to you &ndash; Nature -- and it never will. Because                  it has no game to take power over. It has no desire to do anything                  like that. It just gives abundantly.</p>                <p class="style7">And we will discover ourselves through that. And it&rsquo;s                  just going to be nothing but beauty, to be honest. </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s no doom or gloom or fear or anything like that.                  And call yourself on that, and ask yourself: Why? Why are you                  getting that? Where is that coming from? Is that you? Or is                  that an outside influence?</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; OK. And if there was something you could tell people                  that, you know&hellip; Because we&rsquo;ve spent almost an                  hour with you here, and we&rsquo;re gonna kind of wrap this                  up. But if there&rsquo;s something you could tell people that                  you feel maybe hasn&rsquo;t been said so far, what would that                  be?</p>                <p class="style7">J:&nbsp; Be aware of what you&rsquo;re projecting out into                  the world. Constantly be aware of your thoughts. And be gentle,                  and kinder to yourself. It&rsquo;s really just that. </p>                <p class="style7">The reason I am here right now, sharing, is because you hear                  about the younger generation that, you know, these <em>Crystals</em>,                  and the <em>Indigos</em>, but where are they? Well, we&rsquo;re                  here now. And your children, they know all about this. And                  I&rsquo;m also inspiring and having&hellip; I&rsquo;m almost                  like a pioneer that&rsquo;s allowing the other children to                  come forth and speak and share.</p>                <p class="style7">But it&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;children&rdquo;-children. It&rsquo;s                  also each person&rsquo;s <em>inner child</em>. And that, when                  we balance and merge our divine masculine and our divine feminine                  -- since <em>masculine</em> has been the energy that&rsquo;s                  ruling the planet for quite some time, and now feminine energy                  is starting to take back its power -- but no one has been,                  you know, put down more than the inner child. And it&rsquo;s                  time for them to step to the plate. </p>                <p class="style7">It even mentions this in the Bible: <em>Only one that possesses                    the heart of a child may enter the Kingdom. </em>And<em>:                    A child will lead the way. A</em>nd what I gather from this                    is&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">A child is like our sunshine. That&rsquo;s what we call our                  children: <em>You are my sunshine. </em>And when we merge that                  masculine and feminine within us, there is peace. Then the                  union happens -- the inner child is birthed. And that brings                  such a bright light within us that&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">When I see the stars, it&rsquo;s a mirror of, you know, we                  are light in dark places as well. And when these lights all                  recognize each other, we all come together in one, then it                  looks a lot like the big bright light. Like the sun. Or God&rsquo;s                  son, if you will. The return of God&rsquo;s son.</p>                <p class="style7">And the other thing I really wanted to share with you is our                  perspective on the Illuminati or any kind of forces that are                  causing a lot of discord -- to understand that humanity is                  conditioned to believe they&rsquo;re a worthless piece of coal                  under extreme heat and pressure. And the heat and pressure                  can be perceived as the Illuminati, or anything that causes                  discord. </p>                <p class="style7">What happens to a piece of coal under extreme heat and pressure?                  It becomes a diamond. So they&rsquo;re doing us a service,                  in helping us step in and take back our power. There&rsquo;s                  a major motivation force that is alchemy, even if humanity&rsquo;s                  a sea of potential and in order to grow into its loveliness                  it needs a lot of fertilizer dumped on it -- shit.</p>                <p class="style7">I wanted to also say about the Illuminati, that I really see                  them as a bully in high school, that they&rsquo;re very insecure                  and very afraid, more so of us than we are of them.
