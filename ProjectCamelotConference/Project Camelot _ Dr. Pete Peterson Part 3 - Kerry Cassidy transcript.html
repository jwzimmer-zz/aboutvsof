Dr. PETE
PETERSON (PP):

<br><br>

... I wonder.
I look at Earth, and I look at the things we&rsquo;ve done to destroy
this fragile little spaceship that we live on going through space.
You know, we talk about burning, we talk badly about all the burning
of the rainforests in Brazil, and yet most of the oxygen&rsquo;s
produced by plankton. Our use of nickel-cadmium batteries, and lead
batteries, and putting them out into the environment has killed a
good part of the plankton. Cetaceans are beaching themselves, so that
there&rsquo;s enough food left for the others.

<br><br>

<font color="#990033"><strong><em>Start of Interview:</em></strong></font>

<br><br>


KERRY CASSIDY
(KC): So Pete, we are very, very happy to be able to connect with
you, and you have been very generous with your time, with your
energy. I hope I have a little more energy left, because I&rsquo;m
coming after Bill, and after David, and I just have a few wrap-up
questions that I want to run by you, and we&rsquo;ll see how this
goes.


<br><br>


So, one of the leading things you
said was that you were involved with robots.

<br><br>


PP:  That&rsquo;s correct.

<br><br>


KC:  I&rsquo;m just wondering if we
could kind of drill down there a little bit and talk about what your
background was, and how involved you really were with robots.

<br><br>


PP:  Well, having been involved with
trying to build flying saucers, you usually found that with flying
saucers, if you look at most of the movies, there always seems to be
a robot involved with it, so I was very interested in robots.


<br><br>


In the early
days, when I built a satellite tracking station before there were
satellites, then tracked the Russian <I>Sputnik</I>
when it was launched and called the government and told them the
launch trajectory and the orbital and the frequency it was
transmitting on &ndash; during the McCarthy era &ndash; they thought
maybe I was a Communist <I>pinko.
S</I>o
they came and found out that I actually had a satellite tracking
station before there were satellites. I was about 17 years old at the
time, so that got a lot of notoriety here
in
Idaho.


<br><br>


At that point
in time in Idaho on the eastern side of the state, there was a place
that was called the Atomic Energy Commission, a nuclear reactor test
site. It&rsquo;s where the first nuclear power generation was done.
Anyway, they anticipated having some nuclear problems there and
decided they need some robotic-type thing that could waltz into a
nuclear meltdown and pull the reactor apart, so that they wouldn&rsquo;t
have a <I>China
Syndrome</I>
taking place.


<br><br>


So, eventually
I, and a few of my friends, got the contract to do robots that could
do that. I, naturally, had great faith in myself and said: <I>Oh
sure. </I>[laughs]

<br><br>


I found out a lot of things; that
was a tremendous education. I found out that materials that were
electrical conductors, inside of a heavy nuclear flux became
insulators, and insulators became conductors, and&hellip;

<br><br>


DAVID WILCOCK
(DW): Really?

<br><br>


PP: &hellip;very stiff metals became
like toast and very brittle and broke apart, or like ashes. Materials
like ashes became very hard, and grease became like welds...


<br><br>


So, eventually
we built a couple of different types of... I won&rsquo;t call them
<I>robots</I>,
because they were truly <I>manipulators</I>.
They were devices that at one end looked exactly like we think of a
robot looking. It had a pair of arms that would move and grip.
Actually, we designed them so if you could grip a beaker of liquid,
you could move it very rapidly and it would tilt it accordingly and
not spill it. You could reach around behind you or in front of you,
or out to the side.


<br><br>


Then on the
bottom of it, we had some that had three rolling wheels, and some had
little tank treads. So, this was in the 1955-6-7-8 region of time.

<br><br>


KC:  At that point did they have AI?

<br><br>


PP:  No, the term hadn&rsquo;t even
been invented yet. So anyway, on the other end of this device that
looked at one end like a robot, was a thing that a person got into.
They had a couple of small one-inch television tubes with lenses on,
and they'd put those on and they could see stereoscopically. Then
they had a couple of little hands that they could move their arms and
hands like it, and the robot would move accordingly &ndash; the
manipulator would move accordingly.

<br><br>


KC: And there could be a distance,
right? They could be back at&hellip;

<br><br>


PP: There could be any distance up
to 20 or 30 miles, but it required wires at the time. Later we made
some that worked on radio waves.


<br><br>


But for working with atomic
materials, radio waves could be interfered with, a number of things.
They couldn&rsquo;t withstand that type of lack of physical security,
so all of them that we did for them had wires.

<br><br>


KC:  So let&rsquo;s fast-forward to
a lot more recently, or at least, may be not even recently. I don&rsquo;t
know when it is you got really involved in AI and you started to...

<br><br>


PP:  Well, first I got involved in
computers. In 1975, &rsquo;76 we built a computer that was used in
Tokyo at the airport to announce the plane flights in a number of
different languages. It was the first use I know of a microprocessor
chip in a real product.


<br><br>


Then later we
built a computer training device to teach people how to use
microprocessors and how to use software to accomplish various tasks.
We built that at a little computer company whose name was Cyberdyne,
and one of the people who worked for us later worked on <I>Terminator</I>
whatever-it-was.

<br><br>


KC:  Well that
was my next question. [Pete laughs] So, I&rsquo;m not sure how you
want to answer this, but the movie, <I>Terminator,</I>
is not so far off base. Am I right?

<br><br>


PP:  No, it&rsquo;s not so far off
base at all. Once we got those working &ndash; and it&rsquo;s
interesting to note that the computer chip we used in the 1970s,
there are more of those produced monthly than all the Intel chips
produced in a year, even today. Because it&rsquo;s a chip that was
actually designed like a computer, whereas the Intel chips are not
designed like computers.


<br><br>


Intel is
paying a lot of royalties to various people who worked in and on
various chips that evolved over the <I>proper</I>
evolution of computer chips &ndash; what I consider to be proper. We
now have a chip that&rsquo;s very, very tiny, and has a number of
computers built into it that automatically look at the task and adapt
themselves. So you may have 10, 20, 30 computer chips working on 30
processes all at once.

<br><br>


KC:  In the body of one robot?

<br><br>


DW:  In a
<I>chip</I>.

<br><br>


PP:  Well, in the body of one
little, tiny tenth-of-an-inch-square chip.

<br><br>


KC:  That&rsquo;s operating the
robot?

<br><br>


PP:  That&rsquo;s
operating a robot. But once we figured out the right language to use,
and the right computer design to use, I then got involved with a
number of people working on building an artificial intelligence chip
that... we&rsquo;ll call... basically the call on it was a <I>fuzzy
logic</I>
chip.


<br><br>


It turns out
the only logic that&rsquo;s not fuzzy is <I>fuzzy
logic</I>.
It&rsquo;s a chip that can look at a number of different inputs, and
from those make a decision that&rsquo;s correct.


<br><br>


So, with the
robot, you can be looking at bumps on the floor; you can be looking
at a doorway as compared to a wall. You can look at somebody standing
between you and the door; you can look at the width of the door and
the height of the door and decide whether it can go through it or
not. It can go over there and manipulate around the person, go
through it, not trip over the cat on the floor, etcetera, etcetera,
all using <I>fuzzy
logic</I>.

<br><br>


Then, because a chip was doing
digital computing &ndash; a fuzzy logic chip either does digitally
(if it&rsquo;s high-speed enough) [or] it does analogue computing &ndash;
it looks at things as we see them in the real world. The floor can be
looked at digitally, like it had millions and millions of little tiny
bumps, or larger bumps; or it can be looked at analogue-wise, because
it can sense the roll of the floor and move the wheels and so-forth
so it doesn&rsquo;t tip over.

<br><br>


KC:  But,
weren&rsquo;t the Japanese really advanced in terms of robotics?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I
can tell you that when I went to the Idaho National Engineering Labs,
which is what the Atomic Energy Commission became, which was one of
the nation&rsquo;s largest research centers. It&rsquo;s in eastern
Idaho. I think there are 2,200 Ph.D.s that work there. The whole town
is built around... in fact several towns are built around that
center, and <I>much</I>
goes on there.


<br><br>


When we went
there visiting with super-capacitors that I brought out of the
Ukraine, I got talking to some people who found out I was the one who
built the manipulators, and they said they had a large contingency of
Japanese robotics experts. This was in about 1987, &rsquo;88,
somewhere in there. They had a large Japanese conference over trying
to sell them manipulators and robots, and when they saw my robots
they said: <I>My
God, we don&rsquo;t have anything like this. Where in the world did
these come from?</I>



<br><br>


We said: <I>Hell,
we&rsquo;ve had it for 50 years.</I>
[laughs] So&hellip;turns out it was only about 43 years at that time,
but&hellip;

<br><br>


KC:  So basically, you were working
in Black Projects, weren&rsquo;t you?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, one could say that.

<br><br>


KC:  I just
have a curious question and we haven&rsquo;t gone over this ahead of
time, so I don&rsquo;t know if you can even talk to this, but it&rsquo;s
not diabolical or anything. But, I&rsquo;m curious because I used to
love robots, and sort of went on the Net and sort of studied, and was
interested in how far they&rsquo;ve progressed with all of that. One
of the biggest problems they used to have was when they wanted them
to walk upright like humans that they would fall over. How did you
solve that?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, we
did it much the same way that Dean Kamen built
his two-wheeled scooter. Are you familiar with the&hellip;

<br><br>


KC:  Oh, yeah, the... what do they
call that?

<br><br>


DW:  Segway.

<br><br>


PP:  Segway. The Segway. It&rsquo;s
very simple to do.

<br><br>


KC:  Which is? If you can say...

<br><br>


PP:  Well, you simply have a sensor
that senses whether you&rsquo;re upright or not. And if you&rsquo;re
not upright, then you use fuzzy logic to put it back right.

<br><br>


BILL RYAN
(BR):  Presumably, that&rsquo;s the kind of stuff they put in the
F-117. It would have fallen out of the sky if it hadn&rsquo;t had
that kind of&hellip;


<br><br>


PP:  Yes, it would.


<br><br>


BR:  Right.

<br><br>


PP:  For
example, the programming language that we use is called FORTH,
[spells] F-O-R-T-H. It should have been called F-O-U-R-T-H, because
it was the fourth major programming language, but in those days,
computers wouldn&rsquo;t take five characters, rather, six
characters, so they had F-O-R-T-H.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, so
this kind of segues into mind control, because I also know that you
worked with SRI [Ed. note: Stanford Research Institute], and you
worked with Hal Puthoff, right? And I understand you probably knew
Ingo Swann and a lot of the people involved in remote viewing.


<br><br>


So, what I was wondering&hellip; I
think you were involved in MK Ultra and you can probably talk about
that since it&rsquo;s been declassified, right?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, you can think about that
all you want to think about it, and who knows whether it&rsquo;s
true. I don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s true.


<br><br>


KC:  All right.

<br><br>


PP:  I know that I worked in a lot
of very interesting areas.

<br><br>


KC:  But you know that MK Ultra is
declassified.

<br><br>


PP:  I don&rsquo;t know anything
about MK Ultra.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  I mean,
I&rsquo;ve heard about it, and heard about it, and heard about it. I
don&rsquo;t know anything about it. I know some things that came out
of it, and I know that I researched some of those things, and I built
things that I thought were better and turned them over to the
government. But other than that, I really don&rsquo;t know. I
actually don&rsquo;t know that much about it.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. Is it true that you&rsquo;re
still on call for the government?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I&rsquo;m doing things
all the time that I get calls on, for a number of different
governments, actually. I&rsquo;m actually a member of the
Astronautics Association for Mankind, which is the Russian equivalent
to NASA. I&rsquo;m on the board of directors.

<br><br>


KC:  So, why
aren&rsquo;t you on the board of directors for NASA if you&rsquo;re
on the Russian board?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, mainly because I have no
desire to be with a bunch of clowns.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay...

<br><br>


PP:  If I wanted to be with clowns,
I&rsquo;d join a circus.

<br><br>


KC:  So,
you&rsquo;re really aware of the secret space program, in essence,
and you know that NASA is something of a front for&hellip; almost a
distraction?

<br><br>


PP:  I haven&rsquo;t been associated
with them for years, so I have no idea what they&rsquo;re doing.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, but you said NASA&rsquo;s
a bunch of clowns. Why are you saying that?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, because all I have to do
is look at the products they have.

<br><br>


KC:  Why are
they still&hellip;? I mean, I know they&rsquo;re going to retire the
Space Shuttle any day, but it&rsquo;s basically a tin can going up in
space. Why are they even dealing with that kind of technology at this
point? Do you know?

<br><br>


PP:  Because
they have it and it works. They've had about, maybe&hellip; It
depends on how you look at reality. They have what I consider to be
about 10% of the budget that they really <I>ought</I>
to have.


<br><br>


If you look at
the things that came out of the space program through NASA, probably
50 to 60 percent of the technology we use today throughout all
industries came out of NASA: the metallurgy technology and alloys;
the temperature-resistant plastics and metals; large-scale integrated
circuits, you know, basically even the whole transistor technology.


<br><br>


I worked in things like that. My
cousin and I did quite a number of spy satellites. We did the
sampling arm that went on the Viking Lander to Mars, which, by the
way, was run by a FORTH-programmed computer.


<br><br>


So, I worked
in and around that area. I worked with North American Rockwell.

<br><br>


KC:  JPL?

<br><br>


PP:  JPL. A number of different
places, and got to see the things that came out of there. I got to
see brand new things that were 20 years ahead of anybody on Earth
actually applied, and things that were made from them, and they were
sent into space, and they recorded things from space. The camera that
you&rsquo;re shooting me on, the image sensor in there was basically
made for use in outer space. That&rsquo;s where they came from.

<br><br>


So, if you look at return on
investment, there isn&rsquo;t a corporation ever in the history of
mankind that returned so much on the investment, even 10%, of the
return on investment that came out of NASA. It literally transformed
our lives into a whole new century.

<br><br>


Yet they take that, which is the
only success story that I think man really has, and totally
mal-funded it. Now, part of the reason was that they wouldn&rsquo;t
pay the appropriate amount of money to get the brainpower that they
needed. People early on worked for NASA, not because they got paid
good money, but because they got to accomplish their dream. When
finally Congress snuffled their dream, they quit working for NASA, so
now you had clowns working for NASA. It should have been a circus.

<br><br>


Not that there weren&rsquo;t great
people there, and not that there aren&rsquo;t great people there, but
they&rsquo;re totally frustrated, I&rsquo;m sure.

<br><br>


KC:  Right. But there&rsquo;s also a
lot of Black Projects going on under the table.

<br><br>


PP:  I don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re
going on at NASA.

<br><br>


KC:  Really?

<br><br>


PP:  They may be. I don&rsquo;t
know.

<br><br>


KC:  What about your familiarity
with things like superluminal travel?

<br><br>


PP:  My familiarity&hellip; hmm&hellip;
Well, no, I don&rsquo;t know anything about superluminal travel.

<br><br>


KC:  Well we
have testimony from Henry Deacon and from Jake Simpson, a couple of
what we call whistleblowers, which, in essence, is what you are at
this point in your career, in a way.

<br><br>


PP:  Mmm&hellip; well, in a way.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, you&rsquo;re treading a
fine line.

<br><br>


PP:  Treading a fine line. [laughs]

<br><br>


KC:  And they
are testifying that we have superluminal travel, that we have craft
that go outside the Solar System. Can you say anything about that?

<br><br>


PP:  I know nothing about it.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. You told us, or at least
you talked to me at one point about being a spymaster. Is that really
true?

<br><br>


PP:  I don&rsquo;t know a thing
about that.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. Okay, well, we&rsquo;re
kind of striking out here. Where do you think that we can go with all
of this?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I
told you the things that I&rsquo;m [not] willing to talk about.
[laughs] Now you&rsquo;re trying to get me to talk about them, and
uh&hellip;

<br><br>


KC:  All right. What do you know
about a UFO detector?

<br><br>


PP:  I was asked to build a UFO
detector when I was about 14, and eventually built one.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. And it&rsquo;s
operational?

<br><br>


PP:  I have no idea when it&rsquo;s
operational. The best I know, they smashed it immediately.

<br><br>


KC:  Who&rsquo;s &ldquo;they&rdquo;?

<br><br>


PP:  The government. Actually, the
President of the United States at that time.

<br><br>


KC:  Really? Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  Now, here&rsquo;s a problem
with it. I&rsquo;d love to do something with it. It&rsquo;s a very
simple, inexpensive technology.

<br><br>


KC:  It's based on Wilhelm Reich's
technology?

<br><br>


PP:  No, it
has nothing to do with Wilhelm Reich. It&rsquo;s based on science.
The problem with it is that it works in such a manner that it will
detect virtually every single type of thing in the universe. What
that means is that it would be the best anti-collision device that
ever went on board an airplane, because it could see every other
airplane in the sky. That&rsquo;s the good news.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  The bad news is it can see any
stealth plane just as easily as it can see a damned dirigible.

<br><br>


KC:  So that&rsquo;s why they
destroyed it?

<br><br>


PP:  I have no idea why they
destroyed it.

<br><br>


KC:  Well, can we surmise that
that&rsquo;s why they destroyed it?

<br><br>


PP:  I have no idea. I don&rsquo;t
know that it was destroyed. I&rsquo;m just telling you that&rsquo;s
my feeling, because I&rsquo;ve never&hellip;

<br><br>


KC:  Well, you told me they took it.

<br><br>


PP:  I&rsquo;ve never seen one.

<br><br>


KC:  Well I thought you&hellip;

<br><br>


PP:  Yeah,
they took it. So, what did they do with it? I don&rsquo;t know if
they put it in their pocket or put it in the remnants of the
Smithsonian. I don&rsquo;t know what happened to it. But I&rsquo;ve
never seen one out there in operation. I could tell if there were one
in operation.

<br><br>


KC:  But how could you tell?

<br><br>


PP:  Because of how it works.

<br><br>


KC:  Well, I mean&hellip;

<br><br>


PP:  I&rsquo;m not about to tell the
secrets of it.

<br><br>


KC:  I understand that, but you&hellip;

<br><br>


PP:  I can&rsquo;t talk about it
without telling the secret of it.

<br><br>


KC:  You would know if somebody was
operating your device?

<br><br>


PP:  I&rsquo;d
know if anybody was operating one of them.

<br><br>


KC:  How would you know that unless
you&rsquo;re operating&hellip;

<br><br>


PP:  I would know that because of
how it works.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, would you remote view
them, or would you be&hellip;

<br><br>


PP:  No, not at all.

<br><br>


KC:  You have a tracking device on
your invention?

<br><br>


PP:  It emits something that is
absolutely unique to the device.

<br><br>


KC:  Oh wow. Okay.

<br><br>


BR:  There&rsquo;s
another kind of detector which <I>was</I>
destroyed upon Presidential order, I understand.

<br><br>


PP:  Yes, there was.

<br><br>


BR:  Are you able to talk about
that? Because that&rsquo;s a fantastic story.

<br><br>


PP:  Probably not. It&rsquo;s
probably not healthy for you guys to talk about it.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay,
well I understand that you &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t know if you can
talk about this &ndash; but my understanding is that with robots,
with any kind of device that you&rsquo;re operating using AI or any
other kind of, as you say, manipulator or whatever, that there sort
of has to be a fail-safe or a command override such that&hellip; You
call it a <I>gatekeeper</I>,
I believe.

<br><br>


PP:  No, a gatekeeper&rsquo;s a
product that allows that to take place.

<br><br>


KC:  Or not to take place.

<br><br>


PP:  Or not to
take place. And yes, there&rsquo;s a&hellip; Obviously it&rsquo;s
like with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, nuclear devices, and
Cruise missiles and whatever, one thing you don&rsquo;t want is your
enemy to get hold of it and use it against you. So there must-needs
be some methodology to handle that.

<br><br>


KC:  Are you able to say that you
had a hand in creating some gatekeepers?

<br><br>


PP:  Oh, I created gatekeepers, and
whether they use it there or not, I don&rsquo;t have any idea. I just
know they buy a lot of gatekeepers, or bought a lot of gatekeepers. I
know that right now we&rsquo;re in the process of negotiating a very
large order for gatekeepers &ndash; what I call gatekeepers. What
they&rsquo;re going to use them for, I really can&rsquo;t mention.

<br><br>


KC:  Would you call yourself sort of
an inventor? How would you&hellip;?

<br><br>


PP:  I have always billed myself as
an Instrument Maker.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  I build instruments that see
things, or hear things, or measure things that, heretofore, nobody
else builds. Anybody else builds something, I don&rsquo;t ever
replicate it. I don&rsquo;t reinvent anybody&rsquo;s wheels, I invent
my own wheels.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. I want to kind of go into
a different area that we haven&rsquo;t really addressed at the
moment, and I want to know if&hellip; because obviously, I realize
there&rsquo;s a lot you&rsquo;re not talking about, and there&rsquo;s
some stuff that we&rsquo;ve got off the record, and all of this kind
of thing. But, do you feel that you&rsquo;re protected?

<br><br>


PP:  Yes.

<br><br>


KC:  Do you feel you&rsquo;re
protected on an Earthly level or on other levels as well?

<br><br>


PP:
Definitely on an Earthly level. I have no idea about other levels.
However, when you say <I>feel,</I>
as compared to <I>know</I>,
then I will tell you that I&rsquo;ve had a charmed life.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  I can remember one time in
Vietnam, standing in a firefight... And remember that basically only
machine guns fire tracer bullets. Every fifth round, in our machine
guns at least, is a tracer so the machine gunner can aim his weapon
because they&rsquo;re jiggling and bouncing so much you can&rsquo;t
really use a sight well, so you want to see where the bullets are
going and place them where you want them. So every fifth bullet goes
out and you see a little red glow where the bullet&rsquo;s going.


<br><br>


I was in
firefights where the tracers were so thick it was like you were in
the middle of a 30-foot campfire that was down to the ashes, with a
weed-eater whipping up sparks. I remember about the third time, I
looked up and said: <I>You and me, Big Al, all the way,</I>
[laughs] because I knew I was being kept alive. There was no reason
for me to be alive. Fifty percent of the Marine officers I went to
Vietnam with were killed while they were there. They were there for
13 months; I was there for 23 or 24 months. But, anyway...

<br><br>


KC:  And to this day, you feel that
you&rsquo;re protected?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I&rsquo;ve been in other
places that were even scarier than that. And I&rsquo;ve done crazy
things all my life, to invent things fast rather than slow, and take
it the hard way instead of the easy way, and so forth, and somehow
lived through all of it.


<br><br>


You know, I get the biggest kick
today out of&hellip; some kids spilled a little tiny bottle of
mercury in a town nearby, and they came and dug an Olympic swimming
pool in their front yard and hauled all the dirt off, and charged
them thousands and thousands of dollars to get rid of the mercury.
Hell, I used to spill two or three ounces of mercury a day in my lab,
which was down in a basement, and the only thing it did, probably, is
drop my IQ by 30 or 40 points, but&hellip;

<br><br>


KC:  But that didn&rsquo;t really
matter, considering how high it is.

<br><br>


PP:  I used to go around with a
piece of lead solder hanging out of my mouth. I must have spent 20
years with a piece of solder sticking out of the corner of my mouth,
getting that good lead. All that did was drop my IQ another 10 or 20
points.

<br><br>


KC:  [laughs]

<br><br>


PP:  So, yeah, I&rsquo;ve been
charmed.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. Have you been threatened?

<br><br>


PP:  Oh, yeah. I&rsquo;ve been
threatened a number of times, by just about every kind of person that
would want to threaten me.

<br><br>


BR:  You can
make a joke about <I>Bastard
School </I>as
well. That&rsquo;s a good one.

<br><br>


KC:  Well, that was what I was
trying to get to, but&hellip;

<br><br>


BR:  You can
talk about <I>Bastard
School</I>.

<br><br>


DW:  A.K.A. Terrorism School.

<br><br>


KC:  Can we
talk about <I>Bastard
School</I>
at all?

<br><br>PP:  Well, yeah.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. And what was your
experience with that?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I
call it <I>Bastard
School</I>.
When I was an officer in the military, very obvious, I was trained in
military things. I was taught to be the biggest S.O.B. on the block.
I got so good at it, they finally turned around and had me do some
other things, because it scared them to death. Because I was a mean,
green, killing machine.


<br><br>


So, instead of
teaching terroristic things, they had me teach anti-terroristic
things. Then they &ndash; in both cases &ndash; one, they were afraid
that the enemy would learn what I was doing that was nasty; then they
thought the enemy might learn what I was doing to disrupt being
nasty. So then they moved me on to other things.

<br><br>


KC:  You&rsquo;ve
dealt with mind control in some ways, in some fashions. You know
something about the mind, clearly, and about this information field.
I&rsquo;m wondering if there&rsquo;s something within the information
field and/or the mind-body interaction that can be set up to protect
oneself against, let&rsquo;s say, mind control devices such as the
digital television that is now projecting &ndash; you know, able to
communicate with people in their houses and so on, so forth.

<br><br>


PP:  Well, that&rsquo;s an
assumption that we&rsquo;re making.

<br><br>


KC:  Right. I&rsquo;m making that
assumption, not you. So I&rsquo;m just asking is there something,
some technique?

<br><br>


PP:  There are things that were
designed specifically. As an example, in the probably, &lsquo;80s,
the Russians had a thing that was... because it sounded like a
woodpecker on the shortwave radio, was called the Woodpecker.


<br><br>


They had three
large locations that were transmitting probably several million watts
per location, and they were phased in a particular area, so they
could move where the peak of that electromagnetic wave would fall. It
turns out that one of the places here they had it fall was in a town
called Eugene, Oregon.


<br><br>


People there
were getting sunburns while they slept at night, and they were
getting headaches, and they were having birth defects and so forth.
The Woodpecker had a very strong signal there and a highly
interfering signal. It was also at a psycho-active frequency, so that
it would disrupt the appropriate thinking capabilities of the brain.

<br><br>


KC:  This is
all documented, by the way, on the Net.

<br><br>


PP:  Oh yeah.
It&rsquo;s all documented on the Net. Also, a good friend of mine was
the man who discovered they were bombarding the Moscow Embassy with
microwaves that had much the same frequency content.


<br><br>


So, there was
a fellow that designed a little device that you could wear under the
collar, which was provided to all of our personnel that we needed to
make sure had clear thinking, that they could carry with them and it
would send a signal, a close-by signal... remembering that
electromagnetic waves decrease with the cube of the distance. After a
very short distance, the signal&rsquo;s very, very weak.


<br><br>


So you put a weak signal near the
person, and drive their mind into a range of brainwaves that would be
benign or even, hopefully, beneficial. They found a very simple way
to find out what was beneficial, and then a very simple way to tune
the device so that it would put those waves out. They were carried by
all types of diplomats and military personnel for years and years and
years.

<br><br>


KC:  So, we
can assume that the president and various people are using these
devices to this day?

<br><br>


PP:  I would certainly think they
would be. I know that I carry one around.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, and you&rsquo;re saying
this person who invented it&hellip; you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re
not the person who invented it?

<br><br>


PP:  I didn&rsquo;t say anything
about it.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. But there&rsquo;s also a
technique involved, such that one can do it without the device if one
learns?

<br><br>


PP:  Yeah, you can learn to hold
your mind pretty much in whatever mode you want.

<br><br>


KC:  It has to do with the
informational field, is that right?

<br><br>


PP:  No, it doesn&rsquo;t. It has to
do with the electromagnetic field.

<br><br>


KC:  Oh, really?

<br><br>


PP:  Yep.

<br><br>


KC:  So you use your mind to affect
the electromagnetic field?

<br><br>


PP:  No. You just use your mind to
generate its own electromagnetic field at a benign frequency, or even
a helpful frequency.

<br><br>


KC:  To counter it?

<br><br>


PP:  To
counteract it. I&rsquo;ll give you an example. You get three or four
people that are very close, or two people that are even closer, and
what you&rsquo;ll get is you&rsquo;ll get heartbeat synchronization &ndash;
which just occurs &ndash; and then you&rsquo;ll get brainwave
synchronization. Then, unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on
the situation, you get hormone production, and hormones are very,
very powerful messengers, and then you get into trouble, [laughs] or
not.

<br><br>


KC:  It&rsquo;s a form of
entrainment, right?

<br><br>


PP:  It&rsquo;s
a form of entrainment, and you get an entrainment. So, a very weak
signal can give you great entrainment.


<br><br>


Nicola Tesla made a device that used
compressed air, and it was a little weight. He could stick that on
the ground outside of a skyscraper in New York and this thing would
sense ground-wave oscillations and tune itself to them.


<br><br>


So, it would
start out very rapidly and slow down, and then it would find where it
was affecting the environment. It would resonate with it.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s
like if you have a wineglass here and you play your violin up scale,
eventually you&rsquo;ll find where if you stop real quick, you&rsquo;ll
hear the wineglass vibrating. Then if you play that note exactly,
pretty soon the wineglass will break, because &hellip; just a little
bit&hellip; It&rsquo;s like pushing a swing. If you push the swing in
phase, the swing will go way high. If you push it out of phase, it&rsquo;ll
stop, it won&rsquo;t go very high, it&rsquo;ll go high, and then low
-- a number of things. You want to get it resonant or in phase.


<br><br>


So, that&rsquo;s
what Tesla&rsquo;s device would do. It would move a weight up and
down, up and down, up and down using pneumatic pressure and pneumatic
valving, and he&rsquo;d make a skyscraper just wag like a dog&rsquo;s
tail... in New York.

<br><br>


KC:  So, isn&rsquo;t
this like sort of the kernel behind mind control? Getting a very slow
resonance set up, and then affecting it one way or another? No?

<br><br>


PP:  No, no&hellip;
no. Doesn&rsquo;t
have much to do with mind control. But part of what you want to do,
perhaps, with mind control, is get your mind in a certain frequency.
But that&rsquo;s old-style mind control. What you want to do now...
Basically, if you want to look at neuro-linguistic programming, using
the principles of neuro-linguistic programming is much more powerful
than getting a brainwave entrainment.


<br><br>


Brainwave
entrainment will drop the IQ, it&rsquo;ll drop the attention span,
it&rsquo;ll change the memory, so there are a number of things that
can be done there. But, what we use now is a thing that changes the
way the brain is attached to itself, and the way the brain hooks
together, and we just change the neural pathways.


<br><br>


You can cause
a person to forget; you can cause a person to do things that they
have no intention of doing. You can make a stimulus that would cause
one thing, like a stimulus that would cause me to reach out and grab
some water and take a drink because I was thirsty; you can very
quickly and easily change that stimulus to when I get thirsty, I&rsquo;ll
reach out and grab a glass of water and pour it down my neck, pour it
down the front of my suit.

<br><br>


KC:  So, what
about the idea that you were telling us about the piece of the heart?
You could cut off a piece of the heart and give it to somebody who
would recognize it &ndash; a doctor &ndash; who would recognize it as
a part of the brain, or have resonance on the&hellip;

<br><br>


PP:  It would appear to be brain
tissue.

<br><br>


KC:  And this is a medical fact,
right?

<br><br>


PP:  It&rsquo;s
a medical fact. There&rsquo;s a very good book that anyone who has a
child that doesn&rsquo;t read this book, should be jailed. [Kerry
laughs] I&rsquo;m serious. It&rsquo;s called <I>The
Magical Child</I>
by Joseph Chilton Pearce, [spells] P-E-A-R-C-E, and he has follow-up
books on it. For example, <I>The
Magical Child Matures</I>
tells you why that no center-city, fatherless child is ever going to
amount to anything, ever. They can&rsquo;t because their brain
doesn&rsquo;t form properly.

<br><br>


KC:  Really?

<br><br>


PP:  Yep.

<br><br>


KC:  A fatherless child?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, or motherless.


<br><br>


KC:  An orphan.

<br><br>


PP:  A child that&rsquo;s raised
outside of a normal family environment, let&rsquo;s put it that way.
That&rsquo;s much more accurate. It&rsquo;ll tell you why that can&rsquo;t
happen, why they can&rsquo;t really become useful to society.

<br><br>


KC:  Well, is this the thing you
were telling us about the heart? Being close to the heart?

<br><br>


PP:  It&rsquo;s
part of it, that&rsquo;s part of it; that&rsquo;s just part of it.
There are a number of different factors. But one of the things that
Pearce writes about in <I>The
Magical Child</I>
is, for example, that during the first 16 days or so after the
amniotic fluid breaks, the child is exposed to the electromagnetic
field from the mother&rsquo;s heart beating, and that field is
modulated by what&rsquo;s in the brain cells in the heart, which are
the emotions, and those emotions are transferred to the child.


<br><br>


So, they
thought: <I>Well
that may be true</I>.
They went to Europe, where a lot of women have their children raised
by wet nurses who nurse them on their breast, and they find out that
the child takes on the emotional content of the wet nurse. Or
children who are raised without a father never get the emotional &ndash;
the male emotions &ndash; from the father, as compared to the female
emotions.

<br><br>


KC:  But you&rsquo;re saying it
happens in the first 16 days, after that&hellip;

<br><br>


PP:  The greater part of it happens
in the first 16 to 18 days.

<br><br>


KC:  Incredible.

<br><br>


PP:  It turns out, for example, the
Russians did brilliant and massive research on this. They found out
that if the child is born underwater in a fluid &ndash; remember, the
child&rsquo;s already in a fluid, it isn&rsquo;t going to hurt him to
be underwater for a while. The child&rsquo;s born under water in the
fluid about body temperature and moved up, with contact with the
mother, to the breast.


<br><br>


Where, if you look at how you would
naturally hold your arms and nurture a child, the heart of the mother
and the heart of the child are going to be right next to each other.
The child starts picking things up. If the child is kept in that
position for the first 12 to 14 hours, the child usually develops
speech by six months of age and is able to stand on their own at six
months of age.

<br><br>


KC:  Can you talk about that Russian
doctor?

<br><br>


PP:  I&hellip; unfortunately&hellip;
I could if I remembered his name. I can&rsquo;t remember his name. He
was brought to the United States... I can tell you that his
techniques were used by Madonna in having her children.

<br><br>


BR:  We were talking about
generating an IQ as high as 275 in the children.

<br><br>


PP:  Right. I can tell you that her
children are some of the most brilliant children on the face of the
Earth because of that. I know that she worked using those techniques
for a year to a year and a half before they were conceived, just to
become ready. That could well be privileged information, but it
leaked out to me, and I know it to be true.

<br><br>


DW:  So you&rsquo;re saying that the
heart has an information field component, which somehow entrains the
formation of the nervous system?

<br><br>


PP:  No, I&rsquo;m not saying
anything about the information field. I&rsquo;m saying the heart has
an electromagnetic component that is there because the heart beats
and it takes a large electrical current to beat the heart.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  The body is bioelectric.
Anything near a magnetic field or an electric field that&rsquo;s
conductive, then, has components that come from the things around it
that are electric or magnetic or conductive.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  So, you
can see that stuff in the heart field. The <I>information</I>
&ndash; not the information field<I>
</I>&ndash;
the <I>information</I>
transfers to the &ndash; just like programming a ROM chip &ndash;
transfers to the heart of the child.


<br><br>


As an example,
one of the final proofs of this is: There was a man who absolutely
hated the odor, the sight and the taste of mustard, and got a heart
transplant, and all of a sudden, couldn&rsquo;t get enough mustard.
Just by happenstance, the wife of the donor somehow got word to him
that her husband loved mustard. So he had the heart; that came along
with it.


<br><br>


A number of
people were, in essence, SOBs, or were very tense individuals and
they got a heart from a man who was a very calm man, and all of a
sudden, their wife and their children didn&rsquo;t even know who they
were. They were a completely different person.


<br><br>


That information was encoded in
there, and when the nerves were sewn together and some of them grew
back, that information got out of the heart. It may well be that the
magnetic field of the heart transmitted, and the brain picked it up.


<br><br>


I don&rsquo;t
know that. But, I know that we instrumented peoples&rsquo; hearts and
would let them see things that would excite them. The heart rate
picks up, adrenalins produced; maybe what they see causes anger or
fear. And if you anesthetize that part of the heart, then they don&rsquo;t
have those fears and those angers, and so forth.


<br><br>


So, that
emotional information and some things like preferences in flavor, or
color are transferred and transmitted in there. So, it&rsquo;s very
important to get the child up into a nurturing position. Children who
were nurtured by both mother and father have both male and female
components. Children nurtured by one or the other have only the one
component of their emotional make-up.

<br><br>


BR:  And it&rsquo;s the first 16
days that does it, is that right?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, read the book. The
greater part of it occurs in the first 16 to 18 days. And yes, maybe
that&rsquo;s 30%. Maybe another 10% occurs in the next 50 days; maybe
another 10% in the next 180 days.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, but very early on as
opposed to later...

<br><br>


PP:  Very early on. You want to get
that in there very early on.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. I want to go in another
direction.

<br><br>


DW:  Wait a minute &ndash; is there
any other tissue in the body, besides the heart, that acts like
neurological tissue?

<br><br>


PP:  Oh,
absolutely. Now, if you want, you can call the pineal part of the
brain. Even though it doesn&rsquo;t do brain function, it&rsquo;s
part of the brain. The pineal and pituitary are mostly a substance
called melanin. A type of melanin makes the skin pigment, but they&rsquo;re
a slightly different kind of melanin.


<br><br>


I, in my
research, have found that the melanin in the pineal &ndash; which, in
Eastern medicine is the third eye, the seat of the third eye &ndash;
is very, very, very good at picking up informational signals and
adding a time content to them, thus subtracting a non-time content,
so it&rsquo;s always been attributed to clairvoyance, clairaudience
and so forth. Those are signals that are taken out of a signal that
appears to be everywhere, every-when. It coheres that
for the person and they have certain abilities that they wouldn&rsquo;t
have.


<br><br>


The Tibetans
drill a hole in the front of the forehead with a little rock drill,
and then they poke a bamboo skewer in and manipulate the pineal to
&ldquo;open&rdquo; the third eye. What it does is it gives it a hole
through the <I>Faraday
Cage</I>,
speaking in science terms, and it makes a sensitivity by making a
piece of scar tissue that opens up, or opens the third eye, or opens
clairvoyance or clairaudience, or remote viewing, or remote
influencing, or a number of different things.

<br><br>


KC:  Isn&rsquo;t it true that
fluoride deadens or hardens the pineal gland?

<br><br>


PP:  Absolutely, but what it mostly
hardens&hellip;

<br><br>


KC:  And since we have fluoride in
our water, basically you could look at that as an Illuminati plot to
deaden the intelligence and the psychic ability of the population.

<br><br>


PP:  What I
try to do, as a scientist, is stay to scientific things. I don&rsquo;t
presume about what the Illuminati want to do.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  But, I
can tell you that the main thing that halides &ndash; which are
chlorine, fluorine, bromine &ndash; mainly what they do in the body
is congeal cholesterol into arterial plaque. I mean, that&rsquo;s
well known.

<br><br>


KC:  So, it
slows down the blood flow in the arteries.

<br><br>


PP:  Yeah, it
closes down the arteries. So there are many ways to sterilize water
other than chlorine and fluorine. There are many ways, for example,
they say: <I>Well,
we use fluorine</I><I>
</I><I>for
tooth decay.</I>



<br><br>


You have a
whole fleet of boats up and down the West Coast of the United States
and the East Coast of the United States that can&rsquo;t fish
anymore, because we&rsquo;ve killed all the fish, except there are
bottom-feeders called... I won&rsquo;t tell you the name of the fish,
but they&rsquo;re bottom feeders. That&rsquo;s a fish that consists
of... 60% of the weight of the fish is liver, and about 60% of the
liver is that particular fish liver oil, which contains a compound
called &ldquo;Activator X&rdquo; by Price of the <A HREF="https://www.ppnf.org/catalog/ppnf/" target="_blank">Price-Pottenger
Foundation</A> of years-ago fame.

<br><br>


He found out
right after World War II that one drop of that... Well, you can take
that fish oil, which is highly-fishy-tasting. Get it cold; the waxes
and false isomers will solidify. You can filter those out and the oil
left over has very little or no taste to it. That oil, you can put in
the sunlight and it won&rsquo;t turn rancid for hundreds of years. It
should have been used in place of sperm whale oil for lubricating
watches, but they didn&rsquo;t use it for that.

<br><br>


KC:  Is this cod liver oil?

<br><br>


PP:  No, it&rsquo;s
not cod liver oil. It&rsquo;s a different oil, but those boats could
go out and bring back boatloads of this fish. It grows from
Antarctica to [the] Arctic and everywhere in between.

<br><br>


KC:  What does that have to do with
fluoride in the water?

<br><br>


PP:  What it
has to do with is that that oil, one drop put in a slice of bread &ndash;
eaten daily &ndash; and you [will] have no caries whatsoever; there&rsquo;s
no tooth decay. It eliminates tooth decay. And they did this on
thousands and hundreds of thousands of children in Europe after World
War Two.

<br><br>


KC:  And likewise you can guard
against hardening of the arteries.

<br><br>


PP:  Well, then you don&rsquo;t get
the hardening of the arteries from the fluoride or the chloride. Now,
what happened was... and I&rsquo;ll take the hit for this, let&rsquo;s
put it that way. It&rsquo;s my conjecture that the only reason we use
chloride in the water was because the politicians have already spent
all of the Social Security money, so you&rsquo;ve got to have
something there so that people die at retirement age.

<br><br>


KC:  [laughs]

<br><br>


PP:  Then because of health care
getting better, we had to have something else that made it happen
even faster, so we put fluoride in the water.

<br><br>


KC:  Wow. That's something.

<br><br>


PP:  They could have gotten rid of
tooth decay with an absolutely benign substance that we had a whole
industry here that could go out and bring us back all we could ever
use for the whole world, very inexpensively and totally
non-negatively in the body. But we didn&rsquo;t do that.


<br><br>


Now, the
reason that that fish oil doesn&rsquo;t turn rancid is, obviously,
because it&rsquo;s an antioxidant. It&rsquo;s the best antioxidant
known to man as far as I know. Price called it Activator X. It has a
definite chemical formula. It could definitely be put out there. But
it&rsquo;d eliminate most of heart surgery; it would eliminate tooth
decay, so it&rsquo;s not put out there because that isn&rsquo;t
efficient in our capitalistic system.

<br><br>


KC:  Well, you&rsquo;re talking
worldwide though, as well, right?

<br><br>


PP:  Yeah, it
would be worldwide. Like I say, we did it in Europe after World War
II, for years, but we took that Activator X... By the way, there&rsquo;s
a small amount of it in wheat germ oil, so that was taken from wheat
germ oil. Now we found &ndash; I found &ndash; the ratfish had this
stuff in, you know, massive amounts.

<br><br>


BR:  When you said Price, did you
mean Dr. Weston Price?

<br><br>


PP:  Weston Price, yeah. So it&rsquo;s
my conjecture they&rsquo;re only&hellip; I mean the only reason I
could see that we would be using that is to kill people off. Why else
would you do that?

<br><br>


DW:  You're
saying, about the pineal gland. Because I have a whole long section
in my video that everybody&rsquo;s seen, most of this audience has
seen it, all about the pineal gland. So, you&rsquo;re saying that
this oil, if taken, would help to decalcify the pineal gland, or
somehow increase its sensitivity?

<br><br>


PP:  If the pineal gland is
calcified by halides, yes it would.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay.

<br><br>


KC:  But you&rsquo;re not naming the
fish.

<br><br>


PP:  I wasn&rsquo;t really naming
the fish.

<br><br>


KC:  Other
than the ratfish that you just talked about?

<br><br>


PP:  No. And that&rsquo;s not the&hellip;

<br><br>


KC:  &hellip;not the main source.

<br><br>


PP:  No, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s
called in certain areas of the world.

<br><br>


KC:  Hmm. Okay. But I was curious.
You said something about, you know, there&rsquo;s camps being built
around the United States. Do you know the purpose behind them?

<br><br>


PP:  Yes. They&rsquo;re camps to
detain people.

<br><br>


KC:  Is this something that goes on
the tail-end&hellip; because I&rsquo;m looking for the agenda that
goes behind the crash of the dollar, that basically you&rsquo;re
saying is coming at some point in the near future, quite possibly.
Right? That&rsquo;s what your sources are telling you?

<br><br>


PP:  I think that&rsquo;s a great
possibility. I&rsquo;m planning for it.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. And then, on top of it,
there are camps being built, and you can verify that?

<br><br>


PP:  Well,
they&rsquo;re giving tours of some of them, and you go on the
Internet and you&rsquo;ll find out that there are a number of
locations where people say: <I>Well,
here&rsquo;s a camp that&rsquo;s built</I>.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, and what about the role
of viruses in eliminating the population? Is there any validity to
that?

<br><br>


PP:  I have no idea. It&rsquo;s not
my area of expertise. I have suppositions.

<br><br>


KC:  Well you clearly are a healer,
so have you got advice on how people can protect themselves from
viruses?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I think all that advice
is available if you just download it from the FDA websites or the
various websites of, say, FEMA and Homeland Security.

<br><br>


KC:  Really?

<br><br>


PP:  Oh,
absolutely. Wear a mask, wash your hands; they&rsquo;re absolutely
correct.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  Another
good thing to do is go someplace [where] there&rsquo;s not a lot of
people. We&rsquo;re sitting here filming in an area that there&rsquo;s
not a lot of people. The town says <I>Entering
the Town</I>
on one side of the sign, and on the other side of the signpost, it
says <I>Exiting
the Town</I>,
and 1st Street&rsquo;s in some great big city somewhere else, because
[laughs] there&rsquo;s not another street.


<br><br>


KC: [laughs] Okay. Well, so what is
it that you think is coming in the future in terms of... Let&rsquo;s
talk about outer space a little bit. Do you think that there&rsquo;s
anything out there that we need to be aware of?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I
think there&rsquo;re all kinds of things out there [that] we need to
be aware of.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. I mean, is the only
threat... In other words, is the only threat&hellip;

<br><br>


PP:  Well it&rsquo;s a major threat
that we right now don&rsquo;t have any deterrent for.

<br><br>


KC:  What threat?

<br><br>


PP:  A threat from outside the
planetary bounds.

<br><br>


KC:  Well,
what about the satellites that have recently been classified, such
that they won&rsquo;t tell us about incoming bodies? That&rsquo;s all
classified suddenly.

<br><br>


PP:  Well, that I don&rsquo;t know
about. I didn&rsquo;t realize that had been done, but if it&rsquo;s
been done, it&rsquo;s obviously been done for some reason. And that
reason may be to stop panic.


<br><br>


I know the
government has a tremendous belief in: <I>Whatever
you do, don&rsquo;t cause panic in the people</I>.
Because, when you cause panic in the people, then it draws attention
to the lawmakers, the Senate, the Congress, the Presidency, and the
ruling party. And they&rsquo;re not looking...


<br><br>


You know, it&rsquo;s
like the old Chinese curse: <I>May
you live in interesting times</I>.
You know, try to live in times that are not at all interesting;
they&rsquo;re boring as hell -- nothing&rsquo;s going to happen.


<br><br>


So, I think
that anything that might happen that would cause people to start
thinking about: <I>Well,
why isn&rsquo;t something being done here?</I>
We&rsquo;re out of money. We&rsquo;ve been out of money for years. So
we don&rsquo;t have money to go do anything about it, so why let the
people worry?

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, but you were telling me
something about the fact that you think there&rsquo;s really only ten
months left for the, sort of, rollout of what could be, like,
reversing the agenda. I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know if you believe
it&rsquo;s possible to reverse the agenda that&rsquo;s being rolled
out at the moment. You&rsquo;ve said we&rsquo;ve got about ten
months, because the Earth... we&rsquo;ve polluted our own nest.

<br><br>


PP:  Okay.
Here&rsquo;re just a few things that you can look up, and the things
I talk about are things that are openly available on the Internet;
Library of Congress or a lot of things now on YouTube; a lot of
things on, you know, Ask.com and Google.com, and so forth. You can go
in there and start making searches, and looking, and you can find a
lot of information. There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of information.

<br><br>


KC:  About?

<br><br>


PP:  About the
things that you just spoke about, and specifically you can find out
that &ndash; oh, it&rsquo;s about a couple weeks ago, we just had a
very near flyby of a huge asteroid that would&rsquo;ve caused,
depending on where it hit, thousands, if not millions of deaths on
the Earth, if it had hit the Earth. And it was a near flyby.


<br><br>


Now, maybe that nearness was 100,000
miles, but 100,000 miles is sure different than the distance between
here and Mars, or here and Pluto. It came by very close. It could
have been one of those things that hit the Earth, and we have nothing
to stop something like that.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay,
you&rsquo;re saying we have nothing to stop something. Is it possible
black
people in black projects
have
something to stop that?

[Ed. note: no reference to
African-Americans intended]


<br><br>


PP:  No, I don&rsquo;t believe so.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, and what about...

<br><br>


PP:  If they did, I don&rsquo;t
believe they&rsquo;ve had the money to build it.

<br><br>


KC:  And what about positive aliens?
Do you think that they might interfere with something of that nature?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, if there are such things
as positive aliens, I think that, yeah. You know, I wonder. I look at
Earth, and I look at the things we&rsquo;ve done to destroy this
fragile little spaceship that we live on going through space. You
know, we talk about burning, we talk badly about all the burning of
the rainforests in Brazil, and yet most of the oxygen&rsquo;s
produced by plankton.


<br><br>


Our use of nickel-cadmium batteries,
and lead batteries, and putting them out into the environment has
killed a good part of the plankton. Cetaceans are beaching themselves
so that there&rsquo;s enough food left for the others.

<br><br>


KC:  Because they&rsquo;re that
wise. And self-sacrificial.

<br><br>


PP:  Well I
think that they are, and of course, you had to have worked with them
in some of the military programs to understand how wise they are.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, well I&rsquo;m going to
have to wind this up. I would love to talk to you all night and all
day, and especially if you were able to come out with some of the
more fascinating things that you&rsquo;re involved in.


<br><br>


But Project Camelot wants to thank
you very much. I want to thank you for your service to humanity.
You&rsquo;ve clearly been involved in some things that are healing
for the population out there. You&rsquo;re here, trying to testify to
something coming that you firmly believe that people need to be aware
of, and so I want to thank you.

<br><br>


PP:  I
appreciate your interest &ndash; anything that can get information
out to the people. And my suggestion to the people is... because this
stuff is not really hidden. It may be squirreled away somewhere, but
it&rsquo;s there, and you can go out and find the information for
yourself.


<br><br>


My suggestion
is you do it. My suggestion is that you prepare yourself for an
emergency, because no matter what you do in life, you&rsquo;re going
to run into an emergency. If you prepare yourself for it, then you
stand a very good chance of surviving it, and if you don&rsquo;t
prepare yourself for it, you stand a very good chance of not
surviving it.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay. Thank you, and Pete
Peterson, I really want to thank you again. Bill, you want to say any
closing words yourself?

<br><br>


BR:  I think this is the most
important interview we&rsquo;ve ever done.

<br><br>


KC:  Okay, and David, you got
anything you want to add to that?

<br><br>


DW:  Well, Pete, I just want to say
I appreciate your courage for inviting us out here. I think that the
data that you&rsquo;ve given about the consciousness and the
information field is really instrumental in my work, and I hope we
can continue that discussion.

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I think that we&rsquo;ll
probably continue a relationship for a long time, and I&rsquo;m
perfectly willing to share that information. I&rsquo;m at a point in
my life that the only thing I can do now to make my life worthwhile
is to share the wisdom that I&rsquo;ve obtained as a stone rolling
through this interesting experience of life on Earth.

<br><br>


[music fades in]

<br><br>


PP:  &hellip; been involved with
trying to build flying saucers, you usually found that with flying
saucers, if you look at most of the movies, there always seems to be
a robot involved with it...
