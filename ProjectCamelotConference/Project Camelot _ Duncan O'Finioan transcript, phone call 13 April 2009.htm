This is Kerry Cassidy                  and Bill Ryan from Project Camelot, and we're here with Duncan                  O'Finioan. It's Monday, April 13th, 2009. Hello Duncan, and                it's lovely to talk to you.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Duncan                    O'Finioan (DO&rsquo;F):&nbsp; It's great to be back                  with you guys.</font><img src="duncan_o_finioan_med.jpg" width="450" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; We're going to go into some of the things that you've                  been experiencing lately and try to kind of &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; because                  it's been quite a while since we've spoken. We're going to                  be talking about some things that are going to be on record                  here, and then there also will be some asides that will be                  off record.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Sure.                    What's going on with myself and some others that came out                    of some of these projects is not supposed to happen. We've                    always known that I have one embedded alternate personality                    which we now know has a name. And that name is Omega Unit                    One-Nine-Seven. That's its designated name. We just call                  him One-Nine-Seven. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The alternate personalities were the torture-based integrated                  personalities created by the government scientists, or the                  mil lab scientists, that were used on various black operations.                  But what is happening is, these alternate personalities are                  becoming self-aware. Almost like a computer becoming self-aware.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You see, one personality was not supposed to be in touch with                  the other personality. We were supposed to switch. The words,                  symbols, signals, tones, sound, etcetera. But some of us are                  starting to switch on a daily basis. I'm switching without                  realizing it. It doesn't take the fight-or-flight syndrome                  to make me switch anymore. Could be a glitch in the original                  programming. I definitely believe it's something that was completely                  unforeseen by the original programmers. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have found four distinct personalities in me. You know,                  I have the one that's talking now, I have One-Nine-Seven, I                  have a little boy. And, what we've been able to ascertain is                  that the little boy is who... the personality is who I was                  at the moment of the split. So the little boy's just like lost                  in there. Then there's one that we call <em>the berserker</em>,                  and that personality is damn near animalistic.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan                    (BR):&nbsp; To use the words from <em>The Hulk</em> movie,                  that you wouldn't want to make angry, right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Right.                    Right. That one manifested a couple of months ago, and the                    only thing it wanted to know was: <em>What                  were the orders</em>. And when no orders to be given, it went                  back to sleep.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; That's                very interesting.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; But...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Sounds                    like you're at the bottom of a deep, deep well. Part of this                    is probably my hearing problem. I'm having a lot of pain                  in my ears the past couple 'a days.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Okay.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; I'm                    sorry to hear that, Duncan. I remember that you told us that                    you were having this progressive problem when we first met                  you a couple 'a years ago.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Yeah.                    It's been progressively, month after month, just getting                  worse.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Oh                God. OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; When                    you say: <em>What we have found</em>... who                  is &ldquo;we&rdquo;? Is this a group of you who have been through                  the same program, who've been comparing notes? Or is some professional                  who understands this stuff in a position to help you, or to                  help you all?&nbsp; Can you tell us a little bit about how                  it is that you've come to do this research on yourself and                  your companions?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; To answer your first question -- Both.                  There is a small group of us who came out of these other projects.                  One that I'm working with now, I actually helped train. And                  we were on various assignments together and share a lot of                  the absolute same memories, and we each have separate memories                  that we're still working on. We also have a professional psychologist,                  who is an expert in multiple personality disorder, who has                  worked with black operations people in the past.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He recognizes                    exactly what's going on and he has been a tremendous help.                    So I have someone else that's a psychologist that we're working                    with as well, who is a very close friend of the one lady                    that I worked with. She's the one who connected us together.                  It&rsquo;s getting scary, guys. [laughs] It's like some of                  these alternate personalities have their own agendas.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Isn't                    it possible that this is a sign of health though, actually,                    that these walls are breaking down and that you're starting                    to become aware of... you know, exactly what's going on and                    that maybe the personalities themselves might...? If you're                    saying their becoming self aware, are they becoming aware                  of each other?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Yes. Exactly right. And it's almost like                  we're communicating with each other. The only way to tell,                  now... At one time, years ago, if I switched to One-Nine-Seven,                  it was obvious. All right? Even when One-Nine-Seven spoke,                  it was obvious.

Now, that is basically the only                  thing this personality cannot hide -- is the changing of                  the eye color.

They                    called Dan, and Dan took the show for me that night. I have                    not listened at all to the program.

Because, in our <u><a href="https://projectcamelot.org/duncan_o_finioan.html">interview                  with you originally, and Corso</a></u>, St Thomas was where                  you were recognized. Originally you didn't know why you were                  recognized there, but it was a fascinating incident -- a                  number of incidents -- that went on there. It's certainly                  a military enclave and I'm wondering if you know why it is                  you're going there?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; I                    know exactly why. That reason is two-fold. We'll get the                    simple one out of the way first. It's business. I have a                    more than partial interest. I own full power of attorney                    over a section of property down there on Smith Bay, that                    has rental houses on it, that I'm in charge of. The main                    reason is the island of St Thomas is One-Nine-Seven's                  home. That's where he was created. That's where he's from.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Where                One-Nine-Seven was created?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Correct.                  That's where the splitting process took place. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; I                    see. So One-Nine-Seven goes back there. Do you think that                    there is a... maybe there's a scalar frequency being beamed                    at you to bring out these personalities? Or perhaps programming                    that's going on when you're in St Thomas? Do you have                  missing time at all when you're there?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; No.                    Not missing time. As far as the scalar waves or electronic                    emissions, I would agree with that. What a lot of people                    don't know is [laughs] just to the west of St Thomas,                    of course, is Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico has the largest underwater                    submarine base in the world. Not well known, but it is a                  fact. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People who know me down there, and who also know me here,                  have made the comment numerous times that when I go to Saint                  Thomas I'm like a kid on the island. You know, I'm no longer                  48, nearly 49 years old. I'm 15-16 again. I'm like a kid, you                  know? It's like everything just lifts off of me. The island                  has... It has almost a magical feel.

I mean...                    islands, theoretically, are nice places. However, is it possible                    that this is an implant to make you feel that it is, you                    know, a lovely wonderful place, to attract you back to it                  numerous times?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO:&nbsp; It is. That's very possible. You know, I've been                  to Puerto Rico many times. I lived right on the ocean more                  than once. I've been to some other islands. I don't have the                  same feeling that I have when I'm in St Thomas. It could                  be a fact that, you know, I have memories of being a kid -- of                  being a small boy -- on St Thomas, and, I think it's                  a... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's a combination of things, but I think it comes back to                  that is where the traumatic personality split first took place.                  When I was a child was in St Thomas. Not on St Thomas                  proper... it was on one of the channel islands that's around.                  Ah... the building actually still stands, and it's government                  property, cordoned off.

Well, I think that's happening. There's                  a lot of things going on at the subconscious level that my                  conscious level isn't aware of until after it's done, once                  it's completed. I think what has to happen -- what must                  take place is -- a total merging of these two personalities. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the                    other two that have manifested...&nbsp; Geez, I don't                  know what to do with those.

And... going                  back to Dan Doe, when he was here and we spent three days together,                  he wanted to go to the gym where I worked out so he could observe,                  and he did. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he                    was witness to my eye color changing.

He said:&nbsp; <em>Dude,                  your eyes just changed. </em>But to me it was like everything                  was in slow motion, you know.

But what's                    happening is that you've already changed over to One-Nine-Seven,                    so One-Nine-Seven is receiving the speech, right?

More of that kind of vengeance                  because, you know, our alternate personalities are extremely                  intelligent.

But he didn't know his... the origin. So in                    many ways he was like you.

He wants to find out what the hell happened to him. He's                    very analytical. He's very determined. He keeps on going                    like <em>The Terminator</em>. He's determined                  to find the truth. He's a much higher-ability person than most                  of the people around him, and he's very relentless. And...                  it just sounded a little bit like that personality type that's                  what you were describing One-Nine-Seven to be.

I can understand                  that. That has actually been mentioned to me before. And the                  one distinction that always comes to mind with the differences -- as                  I was told by several people who watched the movie -- is                  that he's finally told that he, as an adult, volunteered for                  the program.

But,                    quite right, you didn't volunteer. And we do remember that.                    So, Duncan, what're you seeing right now, because you're...                    I'm not sure. Do you consider yourself a trained remote viewer,                    or is the psychic part of your ... ah... sort of warrior                    personality?

[laughs]                  I suck. I'm terrible. I get what is more commonly known as                  peek psychic impressions. I'll see images. I'll see events                  happening. Maybe only a brief glimpse of something that I have                  to sit down and dissect and take it apart, and figure out exactly                  what it was that I saw. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Is                One-Nine-Seven...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Normally...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Is                One-Nine-Seven a remote viewer and/or psychic?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Yeah.                    One-Nine-Seven is extremely psychic. Much more so than I                  am. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Just a couple of days ago I listened to Ed Dames                  being interviewed on Coast to Coast, and many of the people                  listening to this would be familiar with Ed Dames' work.&nbsp; And                  he was asked by George Noory whether he used psychics in his                  remote viewing program. And Ed Dames said -- and it's really                  very interesting -- he said: <em>Psychics are not the same                  as remote viewers.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said psychics are either completely on, or way off, and                  they can't always tell the difference. They don't use a methodology.                  Things just come to them spontaneously, and they almost have                  no control over this. He said remote viewing is a technology                  that can be taught. And Ed Dames said that he doesn't use psychics                  in his remote viewing program because their actually harder                  to train because they keep on going off on their own intuitions                  without actually using the methodology. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thought that was a very interesting distinction to make,                  and I would certainly regard you as being psychic, and not                  someone who wants to get involved with very black and white,                  linear remote viewing protocols. That's not really your style.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; No,                    it isn't. I've tried remote viewing, you know. I've listened                    to Ed off and on for a few years. Ah... I have my own opinions                    about [laughs] Ed Dames, but, what he said is essentially                  correct. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I will                    say, however, that a lot of psychics, what they see is absolutely                    spot-on. Where they make the mistake is trying to put a date                    to it, or an exact location. Putting a date on a vision is                    something that's damn near impossible. Unless you see the                    date -- you happen to see a newspaper or something                  of that nature with the date on it -- it's almost impossible.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Well,                    I took a class from Ed Dames, and I have to say that I have                    studied remote viewing on and off besides that, and I have                    to say that he also stresses that even remote viewers have                    a very hard time finding dates for anything. So it's actually                  difficult, regardless of what method you use. But I also know                  that that's not completely true. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ed Dames does use psychics, and as a matter of fact, Ingo <em>[ed.                    note: Ingo Swan] </em>was a very well-developed psychic who,                    you know, he's in essence, you might say, the father of remote                    viewing. And many remote viewers are natural psychics and                    they... Pat Price was a natural psychic. He was one of the                    first remote viewers. Joseph McMoneagle is a natural psychic.                    I mean, the best remote viewers are often natural psychics                    as well. So what he's doing... a certain amount of dissembling                    there, I would say.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; I can put my side of it together in a nice                  little nutshell. I'm a terrible remote viewer, but I do receive                  tremendous amount of psychic impressions. I do get glimpses                  of things, like on a daily basis, and I will follow them. I'll                  turn left when I normally turn right, that kind of thing. If                  I shake hands with someone, I'll get an impression of what's                  really in their mind. I don't hear their thoughts. I don't                  read minds. I get impressions. I get pictures. I get what I                  call &quot;picting&quot;. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like when we did that first interview... remember when I asked                  you, I said: <em>Are you thirsty </em>and you said: <em>Yes. </em>When                  I looked at you, I got a flash -- an image -- of a Pepsi.                  Now, it was my interpretation that, you know, what I interpreted                  it be is, that you were thirsty.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right. And actually there&rsquo;s where the psychic                  part can break down because I don&rsquo;t drink Pepsi, so,                  what you did was transpose it into what you drink. I totally                  get that and I do remember that incident, which, you know...                  It&rsquo;s obvious that you are psychic when one meets you,                  and sort of talks with you, and so on. And with the Celtic                  and the Native American backgrounds -- those two put together -- obviously                  you were chosen, in part, for those... some of those qualities.                  Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Yes                    we were. But however, I will say, in 1966 when I was taken                    in... You know, a lot more memories have bubbled up to the                    surface since we did that interview. And I do remember children                    from various ethnic origins. We all -- <em>all</em> of                  us -- weren&rsquo;t Native American and Celtic mixed. But                  we were the predominant species.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Understand.                    Can you tell us more about maybe some incidents or some realizations                    that have come to you that might be interesting for the listeners                  here?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I think the biggest realization that                  I've had to come to terms with and to deal with is that my                  father turned me over to this project. It was, ah... [emotional                  pause] quite unnerving to find out -- on the island of Saint                  Thomas, by the way -- that my father was a CIA asset, an                  agent, and that he basically gave the OK for me to be taken                  in. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He took me to have the test administered, and I obviously                  passed the test, and we've had some thoughts on that, that                  I'll get into in just a moment. When he... He may not have                  been able to have said <em>No</em>. However, I do hold the                  grudge that, as I became older, he could have talked to me                  about it, but he chose not to. That's one of the things.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me get this while it's fresh in my mind. Remember the                  puzzle... The picture on the puzzle, that I had to put together,                  was the double helix, the DNA molecule. Yeah, I put the piece                  together. However, there is a running theory that some of us                  have that it wasn't so much that we got the puzzle together                  correctly, but that we were able to pick up the psychic impressions                  from the test administrator. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; On                how to do so?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Correct. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Interesting.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; That's                  a running theory that we have right now.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.                    Very interesting. So that means that, you know, your psychic                    ability was a very big part of why you were selected, is                  what you're saying?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Right. And I do remember vividly most of                  the other kids were spending more time laughing, talking, playing                  with each other, while I was totally focused and concentrating                  on what I was doing. That adds a little more credence to the                  fact that the lady -- who we now know&rsquo;s name is Elsa -- was                  probably broadcasting some kind of thought image to see who                  could pick it up. That was the... actually the real test.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; That                    makes sense, Duncan, because I remember very clearly when                    you did your interview a couple of years ago, although there                    were so many things to talk about and think about I didn't                    pick it up with you at the time, but I remember thinking: <em>Well, okay, there's a kid solving a puzzle here. </em>And                  I remember you reporting that this woman said: <em>Hey, we've                  got one -- </em>or words to that effect. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; But                    I remember thinking: <em>Well, what's so special                    about a kid solving a puzzle? </em>You know, kids solve puzzles                    all the time. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; But                    you're saying that, actually, it was quite a simple puzzle                    but what she was actually doing, she was directing you and                    you were following her directions, andthat's how she knew                  that she'd got one.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Right.                    Because while I was doing the puzzle she was standing behind                    me. By this time she had... She was totally ignoring the                    other kids. She was standing behind me, focusing on me. Also,                  I remember my mother was focusing on me as well. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, my                    mother was very psychic as well, 'cause she was full-blooded                  Cherokee. And she would have dreams, visions, hints -- like                  90 percent of them would turn out to be true. My father's grandfather                  was supposed to have been a Celtic Druid. So when you put those                  two bloodlines together, I guess, they got what they were looking                  for. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yes.                    Very interesting.

Do you still feel that way?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; I do. Be prepared to be mobile. What I have                  been seeing are cities and towns in total darkness, on fire,                  with people screaming. Some people just... have just laid down                  in the street and just refused to get up. Um... some of them                  are very frightened, and in the darkness and the smoke there                  is something that is coming through. It's very bad -- very                  evil -- but I can't see what it is. This isn't any one particular                  city or town. This is pretty much going to be everywhere.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; I                presume that you haven't got a time on this?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; A                    date? No. Only an impression. The impression is more intense                    now than it was the last we spoke. That it's... It's getting                    closer. You know, I wish I could just say: <em>Okay,                  on this date, this is what's going to happen,</em> but I can't.                  Also, there's going to be a major political uprising in this                  country. This country, politically, is going to split right                  down the seams -- it's going to tear itself in half -- and                  I think that will happen within the next two years. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everybody... One of the things that a lot of people ask me                  about is 2012. Yeah, we are headed towards a culmination of                  events. I will not venture out and say that it will happen                  exactly on 2012. The reason I say that is due to the differences                  in calendars. No one can tell me exactly what today is. They                  can tell me what today is with the Julian calendar, an Aztec                  calendar, a Chinese calendar. But no one can actually tell                  me what today actually is. So whatever's coming may be 2011,                  2012, 2013, 2014 [laughs] and on it goes. But it is coming.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Are                    other people that you're, you know... You're sort of in a                    group now that you're talking about. Maybe you're in contact                    with others that are like yourself. Are they also seeing                  things in the future?

She said, and I'll quote her: <em>An                  evil wind does blow, and it's not going to stop.</em> She's                  flat told me: <em>Get ready. I can't see what it is. I don't                  know what it is, but it's comin' and it's almost here. </em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Do                    you feel like, possibly, your personality One-Nine-Seven                    could have been created in part to deal with those times                  in some form or fashion?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; [laughs]                    That's one of the things that we've been discussing. Ah...                    Yeah. We do. You know, like I've said, these people who created                    us were evil geniuses. There's no doubt about that. But even                    a genius can be wrong. There are things that have transpired                    with these alternate personalities that, we believe, where                    completely unforeseen by the creators. They've unleashed                  a Pandora's Box. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When they opened us up and let us out of Pandora's Box we                  were used for some very explicit evil deeds. There's no doubt                  about that, and we're learning to deal with that. But, if everyone                  remembers the story of Pandora's Box, the last thing to exit                  the box was hope. So that's what we're putting together with                  the skills that we were ingrained with, trained and taught,                  is hope. To try to turn it around, do a complete 180, and use                  what we can to help. We'll just see how successful we are.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; The group that you're working with... Because of                  the emails that we get about this subject, people having told                  us that they watched your interview, and I remember one of                  the words that somebody said&nbsp; that -- it was really                  quite chilling -- they said that they felt that you were                  telling their story on their behalf.

What's the order of magnitude?                  Is it hundreds? How many people are there?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; I                    have been contacted by <em>many</em>.                  I would say... Contacted personally? Close to a hundred. Some                  of these people are in the group that we formed. Essentially                  what I am, I'm the mouth-piece for the group, and I personally                  think they should've chosen someone else. I have a tendency                  to go overboard occasionally. I do have a temper, even in this                  personality. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In some interviews I have not been so kind with some callers.                  People would come in with really overboard, off the wall narcissistic                  questions [laughs] and I haven't been really kind. But it's                  a job that I've been stuck with and I will continue to do the                  best I can do.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To expand                    on your question... Oh, I... My project with 1966 -- I                  am what is known as &quot;second generation&quot;. I was contacted                  by someone who was in a very, very similar project in the 1950s.                  He would have been first generation. One of the people in our                  group was right after me. She was third generation. Another                  person in our group was about fifteen years later. That person's                  fourth generation. So you see the progression. It hasn't stopped.                  It continues.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yeah.                    And the implication, Duncan, is that if you've been contacted,                    let's say, by the best part of a hundred people, it doesn't                    take much for you and I to figure out that there must be                  thousands out there.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; I would have to say yes. As a matter of                  fact, Dan -- who we discussed earlier -- has estimated,                  from information that he has received from one of his &quot;CIA                  contacts&quot; , there's an estimated one million of us in                  one form or another. Not necessarily as trained, or put through                  what we have gone through, but a million <em>like </em>us.                  In like ways.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; I                    assume that these, then, are the products of the experimental                    technologies of different countries, not just the United                  States. Is that correct?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; That                    is correct. These experiments and projects are not just home                    to the U.S. No, they've been worldwide. As a matter of fact                    I was contacted by someone in Russia who said that he was                  part of a very like project there.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Isn't it true, though -- and obviously Daniel                  should speak for himself here --  but my understanding is                  that he feels that he was genetically engineered, in part,                  to be... In other words, it wasn't just training. There was                  actually genetic engineering that went on even, I guess, possibly                  before birth. Is that your understanding?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; It                    is. It is. We've discussed that. There's also been talk that                    the genetic engineering part started even in the first generation.                    As far as I'm concerned, which is actually the only one that                    I can truly speak for in this matter, I've been augmented.                    That much I know. My adrenal glands are much larger than                    normal. My bone density and mass is much more than normal.                  That's why I've never had a [laughs] major broken bone before.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; So, in other words, your mother, when she conceived                  you, could have participated -- maybe unknowingly -- in                  some kind of genetic program.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; I'll tell you what one of our remote viewers                  said, and I think since you've studied remote viewing, you                  probably know. Remote viewing is not only in the future and                  the present, it can also go backwards. They saw my mother in                  a hospital, the egg was removed, was injected and then re-implanted.                  So if that is true -- and I'm <em>preferencing</em> --  that <em>if</em> that                  is true, then yes, definitely, I was genetically altered.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. I think that, in a certain sense...                  Now again, I don&rsquo;t know, would you consider yourself                  a hybrid?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve given that a tremendous amount                  of thought and, with what I know now, even more so than when                  we did the first interview, I would have to say yes. Now, a                  hybrid to what? [Kerry laughs] that&rsquo;s the question.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right. Well, my understanding is... I mean, all                  of humanity is a hybrid in one form or another because we&rsquo;ve                  been through so many different genetic engineerings, if you                  will. But you specifically, in a group of you, you&rsquo;re                  not unlike Dan Sherman, who you... I don&rsquo;t know if you                  ever saw his interview that we did with him. He was specifically                  engineered -- genetically engineered. He has his own evidence                  of that with his mother. But he was specifically engineered                  to communicate with ETs on a psychic and intuitive level. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; You know, I&rsquo;ve                    been asked that question a lot: <em>Where do I fit in with ETs and the visitors and                  what-not? </em>I&rsquo;m up front.

Do I believe in extraterrestrial                  life? Yes. I do. I mean, my god, go out on a clear night and                  take a look! [laughter] I mean, look up! I mean, to say that                  this little ball of rock floating around Sol is                  the only place with life on it -- or intelligent life -- in                  this vastness.

I know that we were <u><a href="https://projectcamelot.org/duncan_o_finioan.html">interviewing                  you with Corso</a></u> and there was a very clear pulse that                  hit the stereo when it was turned off when we were... actually                  during the interview. When you&rsquo;re on St Thomas are                  you seeing, number one, maybe an unusual amount of craft in                  the sky and/or activity?

But it&rsquo;s                  right there.

So I would have to say: <em>Probably so. </em>There&rsquo;s                  probably underwater connecting tunnels to some of the channel                  islands that dot that whole area.

Actually, if you have family records on                    St Thomas, it might also explain how they might have found                    you, assuming that you were not genetically implanted. Because                  it seems like St Thomas is some kind of a base.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Oh,                    definitely. Most definitely. St Thomas and St Croix. St                    Croix is also a refueling base, as well as a large Air Force                    contingent. Puerto Rico has a... [laughs] one of the largest                    military presence per capita than any other place on the                    mainland USA. They have a Naval base, Air base, Army base,                    Marine base. You name it, they&rsquo;ve got a base                  there.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right.                Incredible.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve had a number of people who&rsquo;ve                  written to us, having seen your first video when you described                  how were in the MRI machine, and it started to pick up this                  implant that was in your head and the thing caught fire. A                  number of people have said to us: <em>Hey, wait a minute. An                  MRI machine doesn&rsquo;t catch fire. Did he really mean an                  MRI machine? Or is this a different kind of machine that I                  don&rsquo;t know about?</em> Is there any clarification that                  you can offer on that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Oh, yeah. Absolutely. It wasn&rsquo;t the                  actual machine, it was the control panels. What I was told                  later on after that, is that there was feedback. If I&rsquo;m                  understanding this correctly, an MRI machine acts just a little                  like radar when it reads the image back, and that&rsquo;s what                  happened. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly the machine itself, if that                  makes any sense.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; That                    clarifies things a lot, actually, for the more technically-minded                    people out there. Because an MRI machine is a Magnetic Resonance                  Imager. It works on magnetic resonance. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; If                    it was resonating magnetically with something, then I could                    imagine some kind of a resonance pulse would set up, that                  actually would create problems. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Yeah.                    What happened is, there were no problems. When they pushed                    me back into the tunnel there was no problem. They started                    talking to me... no problem. Then as soon as that thing started                    to spin and make the sound, when the magnetic waves begin                    to start, it was like someone drove a hot spike through my                  skull. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That&rsquo;s when I started seeing all the images, all the                  memories, all the blood, the gut, the mayhem... the whole gauntlet,                  and I came out absolutely screaming. I could smell the smoke.                  The techs and the nurses were trying to get hold of me, get                  a handle on me and calm me down which, I was told, was extremely                  hard to do [laughs] &rsquo;cause I was... It was like somebody                  on a... having a total breakdown. I remember screaming.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; That                    sounds like one of the kind of experiences that could have                  triggered one of your other personalities at that time.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Very                true. Very true.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Okay. Thanks for clarifying that, Duncan. I&rsquo;ve                  got a final question. How do you see, or how would you like                  to see, your own life playing out in the next few years? What                  do you see ahead of you? Because you&rsquo;re here as a Warrior,                  not just for the military, but for the human race and representing                  this bunch of people who want you to be their spokesman, and                  their leader, and their representative. And you&rsquo;ve played                  a hero for all here. So you&rsquo;re fighting a fight, but                  not in the way that the military intended you to. How do you                  see things playing out in the next few years for yourself?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO:&nbsp; What I&rsquo;d like to see, and what I have seen,                  is two entirely different things. What I would like to see                  is some admissions by some governments that these operations                  took place, are taking place and they stop -- and just have                  some peace and watch the kids grow up -- two acres, the                  lawn and have a little woodworking shop or something. That&rsquo;s                  what I would like. But that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;ll ever                  have. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What I                    have seen is myself and others of the group leading groups                    of people to safety. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve seen.                  That&rsquo;s also what some of the other people in the group                  have seen. &lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s going to get so hot.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Exactly.                I think the times are coming, right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; Definitely. And they&rsquo;re coming a lot                  faster than some people realize. When they start it&rsquo;s                  going to be like a domino effect, you know... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Exactly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DO&rsquo;F:&nbsp; ...once the precursor hits, and the precursor&rsquo;s                  going to be a total split in the political system in this country.                  That&rsquo;s going to happen. And once that happens... [sighs]                  all bets are off. It&rsquo;s going to be crazy. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yeah. I think... I&rsquo;ve seen one version of                  that myself. So... Okay. Thank you, Duncan.
