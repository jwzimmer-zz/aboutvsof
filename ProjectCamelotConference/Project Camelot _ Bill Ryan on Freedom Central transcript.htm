<br><br>

BILL RYAN (BR):  It&rsquo;s
a paradox. I love the way that David Icke explained it on Saturday:
that we are infinite love, infinite consciousness, temporarily
experiencing what it&rsquo;s like to be here with our feet on the
ground, trying to figure it all out. And what we&rsquo;re doing is
we&rsquo;re playing games; we&rsquo;re just playing games.


<br><br>


That doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s
anything trivial about it, but what else is a spiritual, playful
being going to do in all of eternity, apart from to play games?
That&rsquo;s a good way to learn; this is all a big training course.


<br><br>


And so there&rsquo;s a paradox because
just like children playing in the playground at school, it feels
important when they&rsquo;re playing some game and somebody&rsquo;s
trying to chase them and they&rsquo;re trying to catch them and
they&rsquo;re trying to get away, and they&rsquo;re trying to figure
out all this kind of stuff.


<br><br>


Or just like being in a movie, it&rsquo;s
just another kind of game. It feels important, but the paradox is
that it&rsquo;s not.


<br><br>


So I&rsquo;m enjoying pretending that
this is important &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not &ndash; because I know
who I am. That gives us our ground of security. If they kill me, I
don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;ll just come back. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
at all. I like the line in <I>Star
Wars</I> where Obi-Wan Kenobi
says to Darth Vader: <I>If you
kill me, I&rsquo;ll be more powerful than you can ever imagine. </I>


<br><br>


MELANI from FREEDOM CENTRAL (FC):  Mm&hellip;
interesting.

<br><br>


BR:  And so, this is why it&rsquo;s
very important not to fall into the trap which we are <I>intended</I>
to fall into, of <I>believing</I>
this illusion that we are small, mortal, powerless,
temporarily-animated hunks of meat, and when it&rsquo;s all over,
then that&rsquo;s the end. And in the meantime we&rsquo;ve got to
fight for survival and worry about how we&rsquo;re going to feed
ourselves and clothe ourselves and keep warm, and all this stuff
that&rsquo;s at the bottom level of Maslow&rsquo;s Triangle.


<br><br>


The real truth is somewhere else and
this is why, just as David Icke has been saying in every presentation
he&rsquo;s been giving this year, this is why he starts with the
fundamental reality that <I>who
we are is the biggest secret</I>.



<br><br>


Universities destroy knowledge and
religions destroy spirituality. This is where we&rsquo;re at today.


<br><br>


So we&rsquo;re not talking about
believing anything. You have to get above all of that, and when
you&rsquo;re above all of that looking down at the whole thing,
having taken off into the clouds... And this is what for lack of any
better word we can call the <I>spiritual
realm</I>, not the <I>astral
realm</I> where you&rsquo;re
talking about ghosts and ghoulies and inter-dimensional beings who&rsquo;re
playing games just as we play games down here; you just can&rsquo;t
see them. It&rsquo;s just the same; they&rsquo;re just non-physical
in our terms.


<br><br>


But when you get above all that, then
you look down at the whole thing and all you&rsquo;re looking at is
you&rsquo;re looking at a virtual reality game, and that&rsquo;s why
it doesn&rsquo;t matter.


<br><br>


But when you and I are playing a
virtual reality game on our computer, if we do that or going to see
the <I>2012</I>
movie, we&rsquo;ll be feeling this in our body viscerally &ndash; it
feels important. It&rsquo;s like we want to win or we want somebody
else to win if we&rsquo;re watching the game, but it&rsquo;s just a
game. Everything&rsquo;s a game. And so I&rsquo;m enjoying the game.


<br><br>


This is like a personal statement:
what gives me, what it feels like gives me strength in the game is
the knowledge of who I am, because that&rsquo;s home base. That&rsquo;s
where you go back to. That&rsquo;s where you return to after the
movie is over and then you talk about it and you think about it and
you think: <I>Hey, that was fun
-- I&rsquo;ll go back and do that one again next week. </I>


<br><br>


This is why fighting doesn&rsquo;t
work, because fighting continues the game. We&rsquo;ve been fighting
for millions, billions, trillions, possibly quadrillions of years.
And all that does, it just prolongs the game.


<br><br>


And so this is a variant of what
Einstein said: <I>That a
problem can&rsquo;t be solved by the level of consciousness which
produced the problem in the first place</I>.
We&rsquo;ve got to rise above that. And the application of that in
the situation is you can&rsquo;t solve this problem on planet Earth
by being a human being... just being a human being... because that&rsquo;s
the level of consciousness which has created the problem.


<br><br>


You can only resolve this problem from
a spiritual standpoint. Love is universal and that capacity that we
all have as spiritual beings must never be forgotten.


<br><br>


David Icke has said this in his own
way. He&rsquo;s looking at the Illuminati, he&rsquo;s looking at the
Reptilians, he&rsquo;s looking at the child-eaters, he&rsquo;s
looking at the torturers, he&rsquo;s looking at the warmongers, and
he&rsquo;s saying: <I>I feel
sorry for them. They&rsquo;ve lost their way. They&rsquo;re spiritual
beings who&rsquo;ve forgotten who they are. They&rsquo;re playing a
game and they&rsquo;re still stuck in it</I>.



<br><br>


At a different level, they&rsquo;ve
got all kinds of abilities, they&rsquo;ve got billions of dollars,
they&rsquo;ve got psychic abilities and the help of nasty ETs. But
they don&rsquo;t know who they really are. They can&rsquo;t get out
of their trap, either because they&rsquo;ve been doing it for
billions of years also.

<br><br>


This whole thing has been rolling on
forever, almost. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter... what else are we
going to do in all of eternity? You see? It&rsquo;s fun, and you&rsquo;ve
got to see it as fun.


<br><br>


This is why I enjoy my work, because
it&rsquo;s a game. But it&rsquo;s a very serious game, you know. If
somebody actually put a pistol to my head, I don&rsquo;t really know
what I would do, you know.


<br><br>


FC:  [laughs]

<br><br>


BR:  My body would be frightened,
because the body is just an animal, like the car that we&rsquo;re
driving, and animals get frightened when they&rsquo;re threatened. My
body would probably be frightened.

<br><br>


As a spiritual being I would think:
<I>Oh, I wonder what it&rsquo;s
going to be like, going into the light. </I>You
see?

<br><br>


FC:  So obviously, the whole search
itself is very important for people. This is something I really want
to focus on. You say you understand and know who you are. Does that
have to do also with understanding your past lives and how they
impact here?


<br><br>


BR:  Yes, sure. I spent hundreds of
years in Tibet and I came to the West in 1850. I was born into a
Victorian family in London, and it seemed like a good idea at the
time.




I know a lot of people who&rsquo;ve
come from other cultures, shamanic cultures, or from other planets.
It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.


<br><br>


But we&rsquo;re not talking about this
very locked-down, programmed reality, as David Icke would put it,
that is, our current post-industrial Western world which is very
heavily under control, whereas our spirituality actually has taken a
retrograde step compared the aborigines and the bushman and the
shamans in South America who understand the whole story and have for
thousands of years, you know.


<br><br>


So I came to the West. It seemed like
a good idea at the time. I picked up information when I was
meditating in Tibet that <I>Those
guys over there need help. I don&rsquo;t know where they are, I don&rsquo;t
know who they are, but that&rsquo;s where I am going next time
because they need help. </I>


<br><br>


I got hit really hard, because this is
what happens to everyone who comes from anywhere else. It doesn&rsquo;t
matter where you come from. When you come into this reality and you
get knocked on the head, big time, and many people don&rsquo;t make
it in their first lifetime. It&rsquo;s tougher than they think.


<br><br>


And I didn&rsquo;t make it that first
lifetime, meaning that it was a bit of a tragedy and that all kinds
of strange things happened and I could tell the drama, but it&rsquo;s
just drama. It&rsquo;s a lifetime, so what?


Okay, start again. Reset.
Control-Alt-Delete. Reset. Come back. Do it again. You know?


<br><br>


And I finally got my act together this
time. I had a number of things; I know who I was since then. I&rsquo;ve
some adventurous times. It&rsquo;s not really the subject of this
interview; I could go on for a long time.


<br><br>


FC:  No, I love it, please do.


<br><br>


BR:  But you see, if we go exploring
our past lives, in a way that&rsquo;s more drama that we go into.
It&rsquo;s like: O<I>h my God,
I was Cleopatra; or oh my God, I was this nasty person; or I was this
good...</I>

<br><br>


It doesn&rsquo;t matter. That&rsquo;s
over. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, but it <I>can</I>
give us some insight into patterns that we repeat this lifetime,
which come from a program that is remaining from an old situation
that we still think is happening now.


<br><br>


This is why people are afraid of
drowning. Why? Because they had a nasty situation with water in their
previous lifetime. They&rsquo;re afraid of water when they&rsquo;re
three years old. Why? Because it happened before.

<br><br>


And so much that we set up here is
part of our <I>mental reaction</I>,
not our <I>spiritual reaction</I>,
because the mind is something that we take with us. I have a slightly
different definition of &ldquo;mind&rdquo; than David Icke does, but
then that&rsquo;s another story as well. We aren&rsquo;t really
talking about semantics here.


<br><br>


But so much of what we set up for
ourselves when we put the chess pieces back on the board and we start
the game again in another lifetime is some kind of residue from the
past. And this is the only reason why it&rsquo;s important: to clear
things out. Not because: <I>Oh,
I was this. This is so interesting. This is fascinating and I&rsquo;m
going to write a book about it. </I>


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s not important! The reason
why you find out about it is so you can forget all about it and let
it go, so that it doesn&rsquo;t influence you now, so that you&rsquo;re
completely free, so that you&rsquo;re making <I>real</I>
choices now in present time.


<br><br>


And that&rsquo;s why... once again
we&rsquo;re talking words... but any kind of clearing technique &ndash;
regression can do it; there are many other practices that do it as
well. You can even do it in meditation. This is why remembering the
past is powerful, not so that we reminisce, but so that we can let
go.


<br><br>


And that&rsquo;s the key to it,
because only then can you be really, really here and now. That&rsquo;s
when you have all of your power, when you&rsquo;ve unshackled these
heavy weights from your feet. And many of those are actually rooted
in the past.

<br><br>


What we see here on planet Earth with
all of these things that are perfectly real: we&rsquo;ve got very
nasty people who&rsquo;ve got their own karma, they&rsquo;ve got
their own past, they&rsquo;ve got their own trap, they&rsquo;re
playing their own game, they&rsquo;ve got their own purposes, they&rsquo;ve
come from their own places. They&rsquo;ve come here from other
places, too.

<br><br>


It&rsquo;s just a continuation of the
same thing, and so this is why what David Icke says is correct, that
you&rsquo;re not going to handle this by protesting on the streets.
You&rsquo;re not going to handle this by taking a hundred-thousand
Chinese assassins and go to murder them all.


<br><br>


It just continues it all. Fighting
doesn&rsquo;t work.


<br><br>


What Project Camelot is doing is
bringing knowledge to the people about what we&rsquo;re <I>not</I>
taught in schools, what children are not taught by their parents,
what we don&rsquo;t read in the newspaper &ndash; and it&rsquo;s what
you&rsquo;re doing here in the work that you&rsquo;re doing &ndash;
is that we have to know the truth about where are because if... Here
we are in Zurich. If we want to drive to Paris, and we&rsquo;ve got a
map in front of us, we have to know where we are, otherwise we&rsquo;re
never going to go down the right road to get to where we want to go
to.


<br><br>


What one has to do is not to get
locked into intentions, so that one is controlled by the intentions,
rather than the intentions being a product of one&rsquo;s own desire
to reach an outcome.


<br><br>


That intention... you can&rsquo;t make
yourself a cup of coffee, or get up in the morning, or answer the
telephone. And once again, this is an aspect of the paradox. In the
highest possible level, these things don&rsquo;t matter. It doesn&rsquo;t
matter whether you have a cup of coffee in the morning. It doesn&rsquo;t
matter whether you answer the phone. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether
the world blows up in 2012. So what? We&rsquo;ll just find another
planet and come back, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.


<br><br>


But on the other hand, in the context
of the game, it does matter and you can&rsquo;t have a game without
intentions. It&rsquo;s very important to separate out these two
realities, and they coexist in a working paradox.

<br><br>


For me, my answer to the question that
you asked Ruth about what advice would I give people, I would totally
recommend you find out <I>who
you are</I> -- because if you
don&rsquo;t really know who you are, you don&rsquo;t have that
reservoir of strength and certainty which is going to see you through
any situation whatsoever. Even if someone&rsquo;s holding a gun to
your head or a needle against your arm, you know who you are.


<br><br>


Secondly, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s
helpful to know where you come from because that then can help you
figure out what programs are running you this lifetime that are
unconscious and which are your true free choices.


<br><br>


You&rsquo;ve got to be able to
separate this out. Otherwise if you feel like doing something you
don&rsquo;t know where it is that that&rsquo;s come from. You don&rsquo;t
know whether it&rsquo;s an old program or whether it&rsquo;s
something that&rsquo;s a really smart choice.

<br><br>


Thirdly, I&rsquo;d say don&rsquo;t
fight.


<br><br>


Fourthly, I&rsquo;d say you have to
understand that these guys need help, and not in a condescending way.
There are people all over the world who are doing real spiritual
work. The word &ldquo;work&rdquo; is applicable here because it takes
time, it takes focus, it takes energy. You&rsquo;ve got to shut the
door; you&rsquo;ve got to do whatever it is that you do.


<br><br>


There are a whole bunch of ways of
doing it, and I do this too. Kerry does it. A lot of people do it
that I know. They are handling problems in the non-physical realm
where these games aren&rsquo;t playing.


<br><br>


There are a lot of non-physical beings
that need therapy! They&rsquo;re upset. They need someone to talk to.
Something happened a billion years ago and they&rsquo;re still angry
but they don&rsquo;t have anyone to talk to.


<br><br>


FC:  Are they manipulating us while
they&rsquo;re doing this?

<br><br>


BR:  Yes, sure. They&rsquo;re just
taking out their anger like a kid on the street who&rsquo;s had a bad
childhood and then they go around wrecking the place. That kid
probably needs help. He doesn&rsquo;t need prison. He needs someone
to talk to. He needs a friend. He needs somebody to say: <I>You
know what? You are a wonderful being. You&rsquo;ve had a hell of an
experience, tell me about it. What happened back then? Did your
father abuse you? Did your big brother beat you up? What happened to
you that&rsquo;s made you so angry?</I>



<br><br>


He might just start to get to the
bottom of that because that&rsquo;s his past. Now, one can
communicate with these non-physical beings just as you can
communicate with the kid in the street if you can get him to talk to
you. They&rsquo;ve got problems. They&rsquo;re screwed up!


<br><br>


They&rsquo;re angry, they&rsquo;re
upset, they&rsquo;ve had stuff done to them. They&rsquo;ve got a
cycle of abuse that happens just on a physical level where you&rsquo;ve
got somebody who was abused by their parents then becomes the abuser
of their own children. They pass it on.


<br><br>


The reason why they pass it on is
because they go into the identity that they&rsquo;re the winner in
the game. It&rsquo;s like: <I>I
lost that game, so I&rsquo;ve got to adopt the winning strategy.
What&rsquo;s the winning strategy? I become the abuser and I win</I>.
They see it this way. This is how all these situations get
perpetuated.


<br><br>


And in the non-physical realm it
happens in exactly the same way. You have to communicate with these
beings telepathically. There are ways to do it. You can use
biofeedback machines or you can do it in meditation. You can handle
these guys, and I know people who are doing a lot of work with this.


<br><br>


What&rsquo;s really important is that
every significant presenter of information in the realm in which you
and I and we are operating in, many, many of&hellip; We&rsquo;re
working as a huge team:  Project Camelot, David Icke; our friends
David Wilcock, Alex Collier, George Green; a whole bunch of people,
including people I don&rsquo;t even know. They all have a profound
spiritual orientation &ndash; every single one of them.


<br><br>


Now, we met Patrick Geryl. The reason
why he&rsquo;s wrong is because he doesn&rsquo;t have a spiritual
orientation. He&rsquo;s a scientist. He&rsquo;s trying to figure it
out using mathematics. He will never do that. It doesn&rsquo;t work
that way.


<br><br>


Bill Deagle -- we spoke to Bill Deagle
for an hour and a half last night. He&rsquo;s a profoundly spiritual
person. Kerry is profoundly spiritual person.

<br><br>


We spoke about Bob Dean, our great
friend. He&rsquo;s a wonderful, wonderful man. Everyone we speak to,
and almost all the unifying thread of all the people who we talk to,
they&rsquo;re profoundly spiritual people.


<br><br>


You spoke with David Icke. He starts
off his seven-hour presentation by talking about how we are all
universal consciousness and infinite love. What kind of a spiritual
message is that? We need to hear more of that.

<br><br>


And so everyone who is really working
hard as educators to... I don&rsquo;t know what words to use here...
to wake people up, but to remind people of what they already know.


<br><br>


You see, the words <I>remind</I>
and <I>remember</I>,
they&rsquo;re important words, because you can&rsquo;t be reminded of
something that you don&rsquo;t already know. You can&rsquo;t
<I>re-cog-nize</I>
something that you don&rsquo;t already know. That&rsquo;s where that
word comes from: to <I>re-</I>cognize
it. To <I>re-know</I>
it.


<br><br>


This is why when people read books
like Ruth&rsquo;s book, or like many, many other books &ndash; some
people have different reference points, like the <I>Law
of One</I>. They will read a
page and then they go: <I>Ahhh!
Now I understand. </I>


<br><br>


But it&rsquo;s not <I>new</I>
information -- it&rsquo;s old information that they&rsquo;re
recalling. You see, in my personal opinion, we are not <I>evolving</I>;
we&rsquo;re <I>recovering</I>.
I think this is a profound misapprehension in much spiritual teaching
that we are somehow evolving from amoeba into some spiritual being.
No-no-no-no-no.


<br><br>


We were all gods, we started off as
gods. We&rsquo;re all in a fallen state. We&rsquo;re all god-like
beings who have forgotten who we are and so we&rsquo;re getting it
back again, we&rsquo;re recovering, we&rsquo;re clawing ourselves
back out of the mud-hole, washing ourselves down, getting all of the
stuff off us, and we&rsquo;re remembering who we were.


<br><br>


So it&rsquo;s a recovery process, it&rsquo;s
not an evolution at all. An evolution is to discredit who we really
were because we started as gods. You see? It&rsquo;s a fundamental
orientation that is missing.


<br><br>


Everyone has their own touchstone,
their own seed crystal
which is going to start that process of reawakening themselves.
There&rsquo;s no right answer. Your right answer might be an
inappropriate answer or not such a workable for somebody else. We all
have to find our own answers.


<br><br>


Once again, referencing what David
Icke was saying a couple of days ago, this is why I will never want
to work against someone else&rsquo;s intuition. If your intuition is
pulling you to read the <I>Law
of One</I>, and if you&rsquo;re
getting good value from that, I say whatever you&rsquo;re doing
that&rsquo;s working, you keep on doing it.


<br><br>


If someone else says to me: <I>Well
I picked up the Law of One and I couldn&rsquo;t understand a word of
it</I>, I say: <I>Okay.
It&rsquo;s not the right book. Go find something else</I>.



<br><br>


And that&rsquo;s a variant of
something else that I wanted to say because a lot of people write to
us or come up to me and talk to me saying: W<I>hat
should I do? Where should I go? What&rsquo;s a safe place to be? What
action should I take? </I>


<br><br>


And you have to be a mirror and
reflect it back, you have to say: <I>What
you are here to do is probably different or may be different from
what I&rsquo;m here to do. Don&rsquo;t try and copy me, be yourself.
And the reason why you need to find out more about who you are,
rediscover your strength, look at your past, meditate, do whatever
processes or techniques are appropriate for you to remember why are
you here</I> &ndash; <I>because
you&rsquo;re here to do a job.  </I>


<br><br>


This is what you refer to as, in the
<I>Law of One</I>,
as being a <I>Wanderer</I>.
There are many, many terms for this.  Dolores Cannon did a wonderful
Coast to Coast show about three or four weeks ago when she referred
to these people as <I>Volunteers</I>.



<br><br>


It&rsquo;s a very simple word. We&rsquo;re
volunteers from all over the universe, different dimensions,
different planets, maybe different cultures even on planet Earth.
It&rsquo;s like: <I>Okay. I&rsquo;m
going to try and help this movement here because these guys need
help.</I>

<br><br>


And some people say: <I>Well,
where should I go? Should I go to Australia? Should I go to Canada?
What&rsquo;s a safe place to be? Should I go to Peru?</I>
<I>Should I go to</I>...?
You know, it&rsquo;s like: <I>Well,
where I should go might be different from where you should go,
because maybe one of the reasons why you should go there is because
you&rsquo;ve got to meet someone, or you&rsquo;ve got to do a job. </I>


<br><br>


You don&rsquo;t know what your life
plan is, and everyone&rsquo;s got a life plan. You think you came
here without a plan? You&rsquo;ve got a plan, everyone&rsquo;s got a
plan. Everyone watching this video has got a plan.

<br><br>


It&rsquo;s smart to know what your
plan is. If you don&rsquo;t know what your plan is, it&rsquo;s only
because you don&rsquo;t remember it, and the way to figure out what
your plan is &ndash; it&rsquo;s not really a question &ndash; saying:
<I>Oh! I remember</I>.
You&rsquo;ll <I>re-cog-nize</I>
it when it comes to you.


<br><br>


One of the indicators of what your
plan is, is because it gives you energy. You start thinking about it
and it&rsquo;s like: <I>Wow! I
really want to do this!</I> It
gives you energy to think about it.

<br><br>


And you see, <I>work</I>,
the word <I>work</I>
is a relatively modern word. What it really means is something that
you don&rsquo;t want to do. Animals don&rsquo;t <I>work</I>.
Animals just exist.


<br><br>


In the <EM CLASS="western">Marquesas
Islands</EM>, which is a
group of French islands in the South Pacific, in their language,
there&rsquo;s no word for <I>work</I>.
They catch a fish, they light a fire, they build a hut, they shelter
from the rain, they go hunting, they sing a song. They don&rsquo;t
<I>work</I>.

<br><br>


Why are we <I>working</I>?
We&rsquo;re <I>working</I>
because someone has got an idea of how we should structure this:
<I>work</I>.



<br><br>


We don&rsquo;t <I>work</I>!
We <I>live</I>.
And for me, I&rsquo;m at my happiest often, and I&rsquo;m not even
going to use the word &ldquo;<I>work&rdquo;</I>
in this sentence, I&rsquo;m at my happiest when I&rsquo;m at my most
<I>active</I>.
And the definition of happiness which I use for myself is not like:
<I>Ah, now I&rsquo;m on a cloud
and I&rsquo;m happy and I&rsquo;m sitting with a metaphorical gin and
tonic watching the sunset</I>.


<br><br>


That&rsquo;s boring for me,
personally. Happiness for me, is a direction, it&rsquo;s a dynamic
process. It&rsquo;s being on target towards something that you want
to do, or you want to accomplish. It&rsquo;s not a fixed intention,
like: <I>Right, I&rsquo;m going
to kill somebody now, I&rsquo;m going to do this and I&rsquo;m locked
into this idea. </I>


<br><br>


But it&rsquo;s a purpose, and we all
came here with a purpose, and when we&rsquo;re on that purpose then
it no longer feels like work, it feels like a joy.


<br><br>


Sure, our bodies get tired. We talked
to David Icke yesterday, and he was absolutely exhausted, but he was
also joyful in the job that he does because he&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s
been woken up to doing what it was that he came here to do.

<br><br>


What you and I can do, and what I
think is happening in this movement that we call the &ldquo;Ground
Crew&rdquo;, is that people are on the way to realizing something
that they want to do. In the Ground Crew meeting here in Zurich that
we&rsquo;ll be having in a week&rsquo;s time, it&rsquo;s not about
organizing people, it&rsquo;s about inspiring people.


<br><br>


To say: <I>Okay,
I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what to do. What do you want to do?
And if you want to organize a food co-op, then who else wants to help
this person? Who&rsquo;s enthusiastic? </I>The
person whose hand goes up really quickly, they&rsquo;re the guy who
should help this person.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s not about organizing people
into a kind of militant army. It&rsquo;s about allowing oneself to
understand what it is that one is really here to do. That process of
understanding, I think, is part of the awakening process that you
asked Ruth about, that there is an awakening process happening. I
don&rsquo;t understand it, but it is happening.


<br><br>


Everyone we speak to, everyone we meet
when we&rsquo;re traveling, everyone we talk to who has also been
traveling and who reports back from conferences that they&rsquo;ve
been to, this phenomenon is happening like a wave. There&rsquo;s a
wave of the expansion of consciousness.


<br><br>


And again, I totally agree with David
Icke&rsquo;s representation of this, that the Powers That Be are
really, really worried about this, because otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t
have to lock down on us so hard. This is why they&rsquo;ve got to
microchip us, or control us, or prevent us from traveling, or prevent
us from communicating, or eavesdrop on our conversations, or try and
put something in our bodies through a needle that&rsquo;s going to
compromise the effectiveness of this vehicle that we&rsquo;re all
dependant on here in this reality to move around.

<br><br>


They have to do that. They have to do
<I>all</I>
of those things because they&rsquo;ve got no other power. And what
does that tell us about the limitation of the box that they&rsquo;re
in?


<br><br>


I just love the way that David Icke
characterizes that, and for me that says: Okay, I agree with him that
it may get complicated, it may get really interesting, it may get
more difficult; we may have all kinds of problems that we haven&rsquo;t
encountered so far in our lives up until this point.


<br><br>


But another story that David Icke told
in his presentation was how he was told by a channel 19 years ago
that one of the many things that will happen as this wave of
consciousness grows is that we need to organize ourselves into
groups. Because together we&rsquo;ll be stronger on a logistical,
practical, level.

<br><br>


We have to form communities. We need
to form collectives which are able to handle things logistically,
simply because here on planet Earth we&rsquo;re dependent on keeping
our bodies alive. We need food, we need water, we need heat, we need
shelter, we need protection.


<br><br>


We don&rsquo;t need to have needles
inside us. We don&rsquo;t need to have things which are sprayed in
the atmosphere through chemtrails. There&rsquo;s a whole thing going
on. Electronically, our minds are influenced; on a physical level,
our bodies are compromised.

<br><br>


And there are ways together that we
can support ourselves. There are antidotes to all of these things.
There are technological ways that we can shield ourselves from this
and we need to help each other when the pressure really, really
starts to crank up.


<br><br>


Everyone that we know says it&rsquo;s
going to get worse before it gets better, and I would agree with
that. I don&rsquo;t know how bad it&rsquo;s going to be, I don&rsquo;t
know what the timeline&rsquo;s going to be. I think it&rsquo;s going
to get tricky. It&rsquo;s not the end of the world; it&rsquo;s not
the end of the human race.


<br><br>


I think it&rsquo;s the most amazing
training course and I think it&rsquo;s quite tough. And at the end of
all of this, there&rsquo;s going to be something which we emerge into
which will be a wonderful new start for the human race.


<br><br>


But between now and then... I don&rsquo;t
know how long it&rsquo;s going to be; I don&rsquo;t whether it&rsquo;s
two years or three years or ten years. But after that, I think that
we will have emerged from all of this and that&rsquo;s it going to be
a fantastic recovery process. I want to be around to see that happen,
because that really sounds like fun to me.


<br><br>


Last night we were talking to Bill
Deagle, who was saying that he thought the time scale might extend to
2019. He doesn&rsquo;t buy the 2012 stuff either. But between now and
then there may be a lot of things to handle.


<br><br>


FC:  I must say, just going to back to
everybody has to find what it is they came here to do &ndash; like I
say, you come to the point where you say: <I>Yes,
yes, I want to do that! </I>That&rsquo;s
exactly what happened when I started watching Project Camelot. I&rsquo;m
not joking and I&rsquo;ve said this before to Kerry that I lost weeks
of my life. And with that, I knew what I had to do.


<br><br>


I came to the conference that you had
on the first of August, in Amsterdam, spoke to you, and I think my
husband said to you: <I>How do
you do what you do? </I>And he
had quite an<I> </I>emotional
conversation with you. With that, at that conference, we knew exactly
what it was we had to do.


<br><br>


I had media experience, and I thought:
<I>All right, I know that this
is something that I could happily go into. I&rsquo;m not going to
worry about money. I&rsquo;m not going to worry about how much money
I&rsquo;m going to make, </I><I>my
big </I><I>house; I&rsquo;m
just going to do it because I feel that there&rsquo;s nothing in the
world that I&rsquo;d rather do more.</I>



<br><br>


And I still feel that way in spite of
various things that have happened to us, and our information being
confiscated by the Powers That Be or whoever it was, at various
points.


<br><br>


I think it&rsquo;s very important for
people to wake up and realize that we all have a part to play and
they need to figure out what it is, why they came here, and what it
is they chose to do when they came here, and why aren&rsquo;t they
doing it, you know?



BR:  Yes. If you jump off the cliff,
the angels will always catch you, but you&rsquo;ll never know until
you jump.


<br><br>


FC:  Yes, very true, and they have
caught us. We&rsquo;ve been very, very blessed.


<br><br>


BR:  Absolutely. So it&rsquo;s got
something to do with trust. It&rsquo;s got something to do with
courage. It&rsquo;s got something to do with daring to believe that
you can be all you can be &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t want to sound
like an American military commander here, you know.


<br><br>


But actually, before I entered this
phase of my life where I was working 24/7 on Project Camelot, I was a
team-building specialist, personal development specialist. I&rsquo;ve
got outdoor experience; I used to take people up in the mountains. I
started off my career when I was 21 or 22 years old in Outward Bound
schools.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s what in the older paradigm;
the English stiff-upper-lip military language would have called
&ldquo;character training&rdquo;. But what it really is -- it&rsquo;s
about a playground in which no harm is going to come to anyone, but
there&rsquo;s the opportunity for people to learn what they really
can do.


<br><br>


I used to work with delinquent kids
who used to go abseiling and rappelling off cliffs and we used to go
into the mountains and camp out. And they had transformational
experiences, because they never realized that they could do any of
this stuff. People can do <I>anything</I>.
People can do so much more than they are permitted to know.


<br><br>


Richard Branson, who many people will
know as the founder of <I>Virgin</I>,
which is quite a huge financial business empire in Britain...
[laughs]... and I&rsquo;m not actually advocating doing this, but one
of the things that got him on his way was when he was a little tiny
kid, his mother, rather than saying to him: <I>Get
down off that tree right now</I>,
would say:<I> Go higher! Go
higher! You can go higher. Bet you can&rsquo;t reach that branch! Go
right up to the top of that tree!</I>

<br><br>


And little Richard would climb up, and
he was quite frightened. He would go right up to the top of this tree
and his mother would say: <I>That&rsquo;s
wonderful! You&rsquo;re such a brave boy! You can do things that no
one else can do! You are great! You are the best kid in the whole
world! </I> Now he&rsquo;s a
billionaire.


<br><br>


His mother &ndash; and this is the
kind of thing that people get locked up for now &ndash; would take
this little kid, drop him off in a different neighborhood, and say:<I>
Now, let&rsquo;s see if you can find your way home. </I>And
little Richard would wander around the streets and have no idea what
was happening, knock on a door, saying: <I>I&rsquo;m
lost</I>.


<br><br>


FC:  [laughing]

<br><br>


BR:  Okay? And then the person would
take this little Richard back home to where he came from and then his
mother would say: <I>That&rsquo;s
wonderful! You solved the problem! You did so well! You are so great!
You can do anything! </I>And
he&rsquo;s a billionaire and that&rsquo;s because his mother was so
crazy.


<br><br>


FC:  She trained him well, didn&rsquo;t
she?

<br><br>


BR:  Yes. Absolutely. But most mothers
now tell their children: <I>Don&rsquo;t
go out the front door because something terrible is going to happen
to you. Don&rsquo;t talk to that stranger because they&rsquo;re going
to do something terrible to you. Don&rsquo;t take any risks. </I>


<br><br>


I have a friend of mine in England.
He&rsquo;s somebody that used to be my climbing partner because I&rsquo;ve
done a lot of rock climbing in my life. His name is Paul. He&rsquo;s
a wonderful man. A lot of people sign off their letters saying &ldquo;Take
care&rdquo;. He signs off his letters saying &ldquo;Take risks&rdquo;.



<br><br>


FC:  I love it! [laughs]

<br><br>


BR:  Isn&rsquo;t that great? We should
be told <I>Life is a risk! </I>Life
is... everything you do is a risk. When you catch the bus, or you
take your car to go out to where you&rsquo;re going, it&rsquo;s a
risk. When you get in a plane to go back to Holland, it&rsquo;s a
risk.


<br><br>


When you commit yourself to your
husband, to your partner, Richard, it&rsquo;s a risk. By publishing
this video, it&rsquo;s a risk. Life is risky. You&rsquo;re never
going to get out of it alive.

<br><br>


FC:  Yes.


<br><br>


BR:  You&rsquo;re never going to get
out of life alive. Life&rsquo;s a risk, so enjoy it.


<br><br>


FC:  Just give me a bit of a
background again on Project Camelot and how you got started, what
inspired you to go on this journey.


<br><br>


BR:  Mm. [big sigh] &hellip; Right.
The reason for the pause there is I&rsquo;m thinking about what level
to go into this.


<br><br>


FC:  Take as long as you like.


<br><br>


BR:  Using whatever language you might
choose; I am a <I>Wanderer</I>,
I am a <I>Volunteer</I>.
This is what I came here to do, I&rsquo;m pretty certain.

<br><br>


And just as many people watching this
video, and you yourself will recognize, that when you finally think:
<I>Okay, now I&rsquo;ve arrived
at something which I really want to do</I>,
you look back on your life and you realize that all of the
experiences you had, even ones that weren&rsquo;t particularly
pleasant at the time, were all part of the training program which you
chose in your plans.


<br><br>


Like: that&rsquo;s why I did this!
That&rsquo;s why I did this! This is why I experienced that. This is
why I spent the two years with this terrible person. This is why I
spent a year and a half in this terrible job. This is why I chose
this terrible parent, or whatever, because it made me who I am today
that helps me now, with this resource base I&rsquo;ve got, to do this
job now.


<br><br>


At the time we don&rsquo;t understand
what&rsquo;s happening. We think: <I>Oh
poor me! Why am I doing this</I>?
It&rsquo;s all part of the plan.


<br><br>


Now I recognize that so much of what I
experienced has actually led me to this point. I spent the first
eight years of my life in Africa. I worked in the Outward Bound
schools. I was a leadership and a team-building trainer. My mother
was a writer who coached me in writing and presentation skills. She
was an author. She always used to say I should write a book. I
haven&rsquo;t done that yet, but there&rsquo;s a book in here waiting
to come, you bet there is, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.


<br><br>


In my management consultancy career, I
learnt how to handle executives, how to handle people in authority,
how to handle meetings in large corporations, how to present... You
know, it&rsquo;s like all of this suddenly comes into play.

<br><br>


And so I&rsquo;ve arrived at the point
where this is just a wonderful playground where I can start to deploy
all of these skills and abilities. At the time I just thought I was
being a human being trying to make it all work. But this is what it
was all about.

<br><br>


Now, I had an abduction experience 20
years ago which it in itself is a very long story, and I don&rsquo;t
understand all of that story. And many people who&rsquo;ve had
abduction contactee experiences don&rsquo;t understand their stories
either.


<br><br>


Rather than feeling that: <I>Oh
my God! Something terrible happened to me and these guys were abusing
me when they carried me out of my tent in the Himalayas at 7,000
meters in December</I>... I was
abducted out of my tent. This was not a military operation. I was
floated over the glacier in the middle of the night in when the
temperature was about minus 14, minus 15.


<br><br>


FC:  Were you conscious when this
happened? Did you see it?


<br><br>


BR:  Yes, but I couldn&rsquo;t move, I
was paralyzed. It&rsquo;s a standard abduction experience in a rather
unusual place.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s a very, very complicated
story about time and I still don&rsquo;t understand the ins and outs
of it, but I&rsquo;m as sure as I can be that what was happening then
was this was part of a set-up. It was part of a set-up for what I&rsquo;m
doing now. It&rsquo;s like... I don&rsquo;t know what they were
doing. It was probably a software upgrade. There&rsquo;s probably a
software upgrade of some kind.


<br><br>


I think that some of the abductions
that take place are probably hardware or software upgrades. I can&rsquo;t
prove it. It&rsquo;s just my own silly idea, but that&rsquo;s how I
have resolved that situation, temporarily, for myself.

<br><br>


At that time, I had a girlfriend
called Angie, who... That was a very, very strange story, and I had a
number of strange experiences which led me to conclude that she was
not fully human in the accepted sense of the word. Now, I don&rsquo;t
even know what I mean by that, but there was certainly something
inside her that wasn&rsquo;t human.

<br><br>


FC:  Was this the one that grew, like
two feet overnight?


<br><br>


BR:  She grew two-and-a-half inches
overnight &ndash; not two feet.

<br><br>


FC:  Oh, right.
[laughs]

<br><br>


BR:  Two-and-a-half inches. And I
don&rsquo;t know whether it was overnight or not, but it was
certainly within two weeks. I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s one of these
things that&rsquo;s medically impossible.


<br><br>


And every now and then she used to say
to me things that seemed to come from somewhere else. They didn&rsquo;t
seem to come from this little 26-year-old girl doing an ordinary job,
who looked, walking down the street, like any other 26-year-old girl.
Every now and then she would say something that came from a
<I>completely</I>
different place.


<br><br>


And one of the things that I remember
that she said to me over breakfast one morning. It&rsquo;s like, we
had the coffee and the toast on the table, and then she suddenly
looked up at me and she said: <I>The
earth is a very beautiful place, and it won&rsquo;t always be this
way.</I>


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s like: <I>What?</I>
And then she kind of flipped back into her 26-year-old little girl
mode and she didn&rsquo;t even acknowledge that she had said it. You
know.

<br><br>


She would say things like that. She
would say to me: <I>You&rsquo;re
a very special person. We won&rsquo;t always be together, but I will
always love you. </I>And she
would say this to me over and over again. She&rsquo;d say: <I>You&rsquo;re
very special, you&rsquo;re very special</I>.



<br><br>


At first I thought she was just being
nice. Now I think she was trying to tell me that I&rsquo;m very
special in some way. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;m the
only person who&rsquo;s very special; there are tens of thousands of
people who are very, very special.


<br><br>


When she walked out on me, she said:
<I>My purpose in your life is
complete.</I>


<br><br>


FC:  How did you deal with that?

<br><br>


BR:  I couldn&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t
deal with it at all. I was devastated. I had no frame of reference
with which I understood that at all.


<br><br>


Only later did I realize that her
presence in my life was part of this preparation. At the time I had a
very deep sense that I was involved in something important and I had
no clue what it was. I thought: <I>My
God, I&rsquo;ve been chosen for something. Why am I experiencing this
with this girl? Why is she in my life?</I>



<br><br>


I had another similar experience with
my best friend at the time who I went on the mountaineering trip with
in Nepal where I was abducted out of my tent. He was one of these
guys as well. It&rsquo;s just... it&rsquo;s ridiculous.


<br><br>


He would say things to me. I remember
once when I was being silly about something; I can&rsquo;t even
remember what it was. He talked to me. I mean, he was my best buddy.
I used to, in the days when I used go down to the pub, I&rsquo;d go
down to the pub with him. I used to go climbing with him. He was a
wonderful man. His name was Dave.


<br><br>


He talked to me and his voice changed.
He said: <I>You are way out of
balance.</I> He said: <I>I
don&rsquo;t know where these words are coming from, but you are way
out of balance.</I> I mean,
this is my friend. He never said anything like that before or since.
I mean, he was right. My life was way out of balance at that time,
and I was being coached.


<br><br>


Alex Collier, in his presentation in
Los Angeles, when he came out of retirement &ndash; I hope not
temporarily &ndash; and he came to speak. Very, very powerful
presentation.


<br><br>


FC:  Indeed.

<br><br>


BR:  He&rsquo;s another very spiritual
man. He introduced the idea, just as like an open question to anyone
who was listening at that time, was: <I>Would
you be open to being mentored by an extraterrestrial race?</I>



<br><br>


And some people ask us, somebody asked
me just yesterday:<I> Where are
the benevolent ETs? Where are they? We&rsquo;re surrounded by these
Reptilians. Where are the good guys? You know, come on out, we need
your help.</I>


<br><br>


Well maybe they&rsquo;re mentors
sitting there, right here and now, waiting for us to wake up to the
fact&hellip; Like maybe all we&rsquo;ve got to do is ask.<I>
</I>We&rsquo;re not asking from
the point of view: <I>I&rsquo;m
so small. I&rsquo;m a pathetic human. I can&rsquo;t understand
things</I>.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s like: <I>Okay,
we&rsquo;ve got an agreement. I recognize that I&rsquo;m open to
learning. I would like to wake up in the morning with a very clear
sense of something which I&rsquo;m confused about</I>.



<br><br>


It&rsquo;s not like an intention, but
it&rsquo;s just like: <I>This
is where I want</I> to&hellip;
Now, some people talk about asking their Higher Self the same
question and that&rsquo;s another very, very viable technique. Ruth
and I talk about this all the time. We say: <I>Okay,
what does our Higher Self say? Our Higher Self can often come up with
some very good information.</I>



<br><br>


But we&rsquo;re also able to ask our
friends. We have a mutual friend... maybe we can&rsquo;t mention his
name without permission, but he reverts to his guides all the time.
It was his guides who suggested to him very strongly that you should
look in the engine of your vehicle after it had been interfered with.
Lo and behold, he was right! Where did that information come from!?

<br><br>


Somebody watching there, somebody
looking at the whole thing, they&rsquo;re going: <I>Hey!
We can tell you something if you&rsquo;re willing to open up and
listen to us. </I>


<br><br>


There are non-physical beings, or
beings that may be physical from their viewpoint but non-physical
from our viewpoint because we&rsquo;re talking about over-lapping
realities and dimensions.


<br><br>


I saw a being in my bedroom 20 years
ago when all this stuff was happening with Angie. It appeared like a
kind of hologram. It was kind of phasing in and out of reality. It
was real, it was very real. Now, I&rsquo;m sure for him he was solid,
but I saw him like a kind of hologram. He kind of appeared, looked
pretty physical, looked at me there for about five seconds, then
faded out again.


<br><br>


Jake Simpson, our insider contact who
we&rsquo;ve got on Project Camelot, said that the military of some
countries have mastered this technology &ndash; because it&rsquo;s
just technology &ndash; and they can walk through walls. Their
super-soldiers can walk through walls.


<br><br>


He referred to it as a <I>phase-shift</I>.
You shift the phase... I don&rsquo;t know what this means! You shift
the phase of these electron clouds, quantum probabilities, and empty
space that we call matter, such that they just move through each
other.


<br><br>


Why not? The only reason why two
things hit each other and bounce off is because you&rsquo;ve got the
apparency of a force through the various electromagnetic reactions
that are at a quantum level. I&rsquo;m not saying this technically
accurately.


<br><br>


You&rsquo;ve got the Strong Nuclear
Force, the Weak Nuclear Force, you&rsquo;ve Electromagnetism and
you&rsquo;ve got Gravity &ndash; these are the four basic forces as
best as I remember it. And the combination of these things results in
the apparency of things being solid, and the fact that I can&rsquo;t
put this hand through this wall.


<br><br>


I have spoken with somebody who was at
a party where there were some people who seemed to be
Illuminati-connected, Illuminati, basically. They are black
magicians, among many other things. They can do all kinds of stuff.
And ultimately, because everything is a solid expression of thought
or spirituality, whatever words you want to use, we can actually
transcend this stuff without using high technology.


<br><br>


And so he watched a demonstration by
somebody who put his hand through the wall. Like <I>wwwhhht,
</I>like a special effect in a
movie, straight in, straight out. And people can bi-locate, people
can levitate.


<br><br>


If you read that wonderful book which
I read many years ago that David Icke referenced in his presentation,
Michael Talbot&rsquo;s <I>The
Holographic Universe</I>,
there&rsquo;re a couple of chapters in there about miracles in the
past.


<br><br>


David Icke talks about fire-walking.
There are many, many documented instances of people in a state of
religious ecstasy, which basically is in a trance state, some kind of
an altered state, where red-hot branding-irons don&rsquo;t touch
their skin; they&rsquo;ve got big hooks in them, and then the hooks
are taken out of their body, and then suddenly, there&rsquo;s no
wounds anymore.


<br><br>


In the modern day we&rsquo;ve got
these psychic surgeons in the Philippines, who can reach inside
someone&rsquo;s body, take out a tumor, remove it again, and then the
body just heals over, that&rsquo;s it, and then he&rsquo;s got the
tumor in a jar. No anesthetic, no nothing, he just reaches in and
pulls it out. These are
Filipino psychic surgeons.


<br><br>


Lyall Watson in his books <I>Supernature</I>
and <I>Lifetide</I>,
talks about this quite a lot. There are a whole bunch of them in the
Philippines.


<br><br>


FC:  Wow.

<br><br>


BR:  There are about, last I heard,
about 20 of them. There&rsquo;s a guy in Brazil whose name, I
believe, translates as &ldquo;John of God&rdquo;. He handles
something like up to 3,000 patients a day. They come in a long line;
they&rsquo;re about ten seconds each. He says: <I>Okay,
you need this. You need this. You need this</I>.



<br><br>


And sometimes he picks up a rusty
razor blade, opens them up with this rusty razor blade, no
anesthetic, no nothing. He just says: <I>Right,
okay</I>, [makes slicing
sound], pulls something out, and that&rsquo;s it. <I>Okay.
Right. Next!</I> And then
there&rsquo;s no wound, there&rsquo;s no nothing, and they&rsquo;re
fine.


<br><br>


FC:  That&rsquo;s incredible.


<br><br>


BR:  And his name is &ldquo;John of
God&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d love to go and see him. I mean, he&rsquo;s on
the Internet. You can check him out, you can go on tours, you can go
and see him, and then you can be one of those 3,000 people. And if
you get the rusty razor blade treatment, make sure you&rsquo;ve got
your camera.


<br><br>


FC:  [laughs]

<br><br>


BR:  So all of that is testimony to
the fact that, as Michael Talbot would put it, we are living in a
Holographic Universe.


<br><br>


FC:  Yes.


<br><br>


BR:  And we got into talking about
this because I was talking about my friend who told me about the
party that he went to with these strange Illuminati characters, where
he put his hands through the wall. And before that we were talking
about this Being that was in my room who materialized. And before
that we were talking about seeking help from our etheric friends who
are also in this non-physical world.


<br><br>


But all of this, if you see it all as
a <I>Star Trek</I>
holodeck, where you&rsquo;ve got all of these different things, and
whatever you see depends on what, as David Icke would say it again,
what radio station you&rsquo;re tuning into. All of these are
metaphors. You have to kind of <I>grok</I>
this, you know, these concepts.

<br><br>


You realize that there&rsquo;s so much
room for anything to happen in life that you want to. Miracles become
possible. There is no such thing as coincidence. One can plan one&rsquo;s
own life. You can meet who you need to meet. And if you want to apply
this on a physical level, you can step in a jump-room and you can end
up on Mars, because it&rsquo;s just another application of practical
magic.


<br><br>


There&rsquo;s nothing really going on
anyway, it&rsquo;s just a dream. Why don&rsquo;t you make it a lucid
dream and then you can do anything you want to. Some people do that.


<br><br>


The Tibetan mystics &ndash; and I
spent hundreds of years hanging out with them, and I used to be one,
I think, at some point &ndash; had these sorts of abilities. They can
do all kinds of stuff over there. It&rsquo;s never really been
exported into the Western world.


<br><br>


In the West, we&rsquo;re very
technology-dependent.  We exist in a very, very controlled way. We&rsquo;re
lied to, controlled, manipulated, from the moment that we&rsquo;re
born. And we think that we&rsquo;re the most advanced race on Earth,
and actually, we&rsquo;re really the most primitive.


<br><br>


This is where I have my difference,
and this is a leap here: I love the way that Richard Dolan, in his
presentation at the Los Angeles Camelot Conference and in other
presentations he&rsquo;s made, he argues the point very, very
cogently that just because a civilization is technologically
advanced, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it knows what&rsquo;s going on.
It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s spiritually advanced. It doesn&rsquo;t
mean that it&rsquo;s going to have grown beyond the point of being
benevolent.


<br><br>


And he uses this wonderful example
that just supposing we now had a time machine, we could go back just
a thousand years and talk to some of the people in the year 1000
A.D., and you could bring your camera with you, you could bring your
laptop with you. You could maybe bring your car with you. You could
bring your cell phone with you.


<br><br>


They would see all of this incredible
technology that, to them, would be like magic. They would say: <I>You
are such advanced beings, you must have solved every problem in
wherever it is that you come from. You must all be benevolent. You
must all be like angels</I>.
<I>You must have handled the
problems of war, poverty and disease, because look at this technology
that you&rsquo;ve got. </I>


<br><br>


The logic doesn&rsquo;t work. The
logic doesn&rsquo;t work. Just because you&rsquo;ve got fancy toys
that do things that seem like magic, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re
at an advanced level of spiritual ability. It just means you&rsquo;ve
got fancy toys, and some of the ETs are like that.


<br><br>


That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with
this hypothesis that says that just because they&rsquo;re flying
about, they&rsquo;re using things that don&rsquo;t seem to be rocket
ships, and seem to access to other dimensions, and they can do fancy
stuff with all of their toys, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are
advanced beings, spiritually. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re
benevolent. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re friendly. It
doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t have their own problems.


<br><br>


It just means that they&rsquo;re
beings operating in this universe playing games like we all are. They
have their own karma, they have their own past, they have their own
agendas, they have their own purposes. They may be doing things with
us, to us, that we can&rsquo;t even imagine and it&rsquo;s very, very
dangerous to make the assumption that they&rsquo;re all wise and all
benevolent. They may not be.


<br><br>


I just wanted to slip that in because
it&rsquo;s so important, given that we&rsquo;re talking about
technology.


<br><br>


FC:   I see. Well, on that vein, I
want to get into talking about extraterrestrial beings, either on or
off Earth. What is actually going on? Who is running this planet? And
[laughs] when are they going to come out and let us know they&rsquo;re
here?


<br><br>


BR:  Ah! There&rsquo;re a couple of
simple questions for you.


<br><br>


FC:  Yes.


<br><br>


BR:  [sighs] I don&rsquo;t know. There
seems to be a move towards something. Let&rsquo;s just build this up
slowly.


<br><br>


Larry King, on his show <I>Larry
King Live</I>, has had more
people on his interview show talking about UFOs and extraterrestrials
this year than he has ever had before. Why? Interesting.


<br><br>


Last year, the head Vatican
astronomer, his name I can&rsquo;t remember, made a public statement
&ndash; this is my paraphrase &ndash; saying that: <I>If
extraterrestrials exist, we must remember that they are all our
brothers and sisters under God. </I>So
that came right out of the blue. Where did that come from, or why did
he say that?


<br><br>


Last week, approximately, if I
remember rightly, the same guy held a five-day conference all about
the possibility of the reality of extraterrestrial life.


<br><br>


Another interesting thing that&rsquo;s
happened is that NASA has announced that there is water on the Moon
as a result of the LCROSS space probe crashing-into-the-Moon
experiment that they did.


<br><br>


Richard Hoagland, who we know, he&rsquo;s
an interesting guy with interesting theories. He&rsquo;s no fool. We
like him. He&rsquo;s a smart guy. He makes a lot of interesting
contributions to these debates. He predicted on Coast to Coast that
the next step in this chess game was that they would announce that
there&rsquo;s water on the Moon, because that&rsquo;s one of the
things that... It&rsquo;s like introducing these ideas. It&rsquo;s
like: <I>Oh, there&rsquo;s
water on the Moon.</I>


<br><br>


Okay, now most people realize that
where there&rsquo;s water, there could be life. Next thing, they&rsquo;ll
find something else. So it&rsquo;s coming.


<br><br>


Clay and Shawn Pickering, who are two
New York-based researchers, and what they told us isn&rsquo;t new to
the extent that it has not been reported before. Michael Salla has
reported this story. It&rsquo;s been reported on the Open Minds
Forum.


<br><br>


It created a little bit of a stir
about 18 months ago when they reported that they&rsquo;d been
contacted by a US Navy source who disclosed the reality of meetings
in the United Nations, of one meeting at the United Nations behind
closed doors that was disguised as something else, but was <I>really</I>
a meeting about preparing internationally for the Disclosure of the
extraterrestrial reality. And after that it went to a number of other
venues in various places.


<br><br>


Based upon the principle that if there
is to be Disclosure to the world&rsquo;s population, the Americans
have got to be in agreement with the Russians and the Chinese and the
Germans and the French and the Brits and the South Africans and the
Australians and everyone else about how they&rsquo;re going to play
this story out; if you take South Africa...


<br><br>


If the American President makes a
statement, then the next thing that will happen is that the South
African president will be asked the same question by the South
African press, saying: <I>What
do you know about this? </I>He&rsquo;s
got to give the same answer. Otherwise you&rsquo;ve got a real
problem, because you&rsquo;ve got people giving different accounts.


<br><br>


What account to give, and what to say,
and how to say it, apparently is being discussed at very high levels
and has been for at least 18 months and probably for much, much
longer than that.


<br><br>


When Clay and Shawn Pickering
contacted us -- this is all on the Project Camelot site -- they
referenced our interview with Stephen Greer. We&rsquo;ve had a lot of
interesting feedback about that. Some people really didn&rsquo;t like
it. It&rsquo;s like: <I>How
could you challenge this guy? How could you be so belligerent?  How
could you disagree with him so strongly when it&rsquo;s just meant to
be an interview?</I> they say.

<br><br>


Clay and Shawn Pickering said: <I>This
is the best interview you&rsquo;ve ever done because the level of
passion and disagreement and intelligent debate, and heated
intelligent debate, mirrors exactly what is the reality behind closed
doors at the highest level of policy</I>.



<br><br>


They said: <I>This
is completely representative of the angst and the disagreement and
the concern that there is among good people at the highest levels of
policy. </I>


<br><br>


They don&rsquo;t have the answers to
these questions either. They don&rsquo;t know who they can trust.
They don&rsquo;t know what to say. They don&rsquo;t know what it
means if somebody comes along saying:  <I>I&rsquo;m
an ET -- here&rsquo;s some technology and we&rsquo;re giving it to
you because we like you. </I>


<br><br>


Now of course, I&rsquo;m saying that
in a sort of playful way, but how can we understand and how can we be
sure of the agendas of these beings? Some of them will be genuinely
friendly and others may not be.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s very, very important to
make the right decisions about these and it&rsquo;s very, very
important to give people the right information. I think that whoever
it is who&rsquo;s pushing for this Disclosure &ndash; and it is
coming, I believe. Something&rsquo;s coming. We don&rsquo;t know when
and we don&rsquo;t know what and we don&rsquo;t know how much truth
it&rsquo;s going to contain.


<br><br>


Pete Peterson, when we spoke to him at
the end of June of this year, told us that he had been told by his
own source&hellip; Now, let me back up a little bit here, because
this has become an Internet rumor that&rsquo;s kind of gone wild.

<br><br>


I&rsquo;ll just repeat again exactly
what he said. He said that he had been told by a source of his that
television time had been booked for the 27th of November, across many
networks, in which Obama was planning to make an announcement. After
then immediately after that he said: <I>Just
because it&rsquo;s planned doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s going to
happen</I>. We spoke to him a
short while ago and he said he&rsquo;d give it 50/50. That&rsquo;s
just his personal guess.


<br><br>


This is the information that David
Wilcock was referring to when he went out on quite a long thin limb
on Coast to Coast. Now, we love David, he&rsquo;s a good friend of
ours, he may know things that we don&rsquo;t know. But based upon
what we were all told by Pete Peterson at the same time, I would not
have said something quite so strongly as David did.


<br><br>


The problem is with making a
prediction like that is -- like Blossom Goodchild last year -- you
get to look a little bit silly if you&rsquo;re wrong. So I want to
present this with every <I>caveat</I>
I can think of, that who knows whether it&rsquo;s going to happen the
27th of November?


<br><br>


It looks like, if they were going to
make a run-up to this, they should be saying a little bit more than
just they found water on the Moon.


<br><br>


It sounds like there are several other
intermediate steps before they say something. Clay and Shawn
Pickering tells us that the heated debates behind closed doors are
still going on and they&rsquo;re not close to being resolved yet.


<br><br>


My personal feeling, and I do want to
say this on record, is that we&rsquo;re not going to hear anything on
November 27th. I&rsquo;d love to be wrong, but I think it&rsquo;s too
early. I think that may have been hopeful.


<br><br>


It may well have been booked, but who
knows what other provisional bookings they&rsquo;ve made for the
coming months? We just don&rsquo;t have that information. Pete
Peterson doesn&rsquo;t know either. He was just reporting what he was
told.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s coming, we don&rsquo;t know
when, we don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re being told, and some
people in the Disclosure movement think: <I>Right.
Our long battle for 30,40, 50 years, ever since Roswell, is going to
be over as soon the President or whoever it is makes his announcement
to the White House Press Corps</I>.



<br><br>


And I would say: <I>Well
actually that&rsquo;s where it might just begin</I>,
because we don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re going to say. We don&rsquo;t
know how some of those questions are going to be fielded. We don&rsquo;t
know what happens after that. There may be a whole new game on in
terms of: <I>Oh my God! They&rsquo;ve
told us this, and we know that that&rsquo;s not true</I>.



<br><br>


Now, everyone in the world is
believing that good comes from the President&rsquo;s mouth. So now
we&rsquo;re doing a new level of problems to deal with in terms of
what&rsquo;s true, what&rsquo;s not true, what&rsquo;s been reported,
what do people believe, how is this making people react, and why they
are doing all of this.


<br><br>


You have to see this whole thing as a
chess game, and a chess game can be played out in many different
ways. It could be a distraction to give people something to get
fascinated with for several months while this all comes out while
meanwhile, they&rsquo;re doing their micro-chipping quietly on the
other&hellip;

<br><br>


I mean, it&rsquo;d be a wonderful way
to take the heat off the swine flu debate by suddenly announcing that
ETs are real. All of a sudden this thing about whether or not
children should get vaccinated starts to feel not very interesting.
It&rsquo;s much more interesting and sexy to talk about this other
stuff. They could be doing it now.


<br><br>


There are so many things happening at
once at the moment. The <I>2012</I>
movie was released just a few days ago. I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet.
I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s not very good, but it&rsquo;s very
spectacular. But they&rsquo;ve released that for a reason, and there
is definitely is a plan to drive us into fear, because fear makes us
easier to control.


<br><br>


One has to think the way they think.
These people are very clever. Everything that happens is for a
reason. There may be a whole bunch of misdirects going on that are
causing us to feel and think and worry about and maybe react against
this thing over here, and something very quietly is happening over
there.  We need to be smart enough to try and anticipate what these
games are. Once again, I use the word &ldquo;game&rdquo; advisably
because we have to see it that way.


<br><br>


When our interview with Deagle, the
one that we did last night, is published &ndash; and I hope to do
that this afternoon because it&rsquo;s very, very important stuff &ndash;
he presents a different scenario for what we might be experiencing,
not just up to 2012 but up to maybe as late as 2019. He doesn&rsquo;t
think at all that things are suddenly going to go pear-shaped in
December 2012.


<br><br>


He&rsquo;s a very smart man, is
Deagle. He&rsquo;s sure that Patrick Geryl and Cliff High have got
this all wrong. He says that there is likely to be some very intense
solar activity that&rsquo;s going to result in physical effects on
this planet, and that there will be a crustal displacement.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s a very interesting theory,
this &ndash; not a pole shift -- but the Earth&rsquo;s crust is like
the skin that&rsquo;s formed on hot milk. It&rsquo;s sort of looks
like its solid, but actually, it can move around. It doesn&rsquo;t
break up, but it can break up, and it kind of floats about on this
viscous surface, which actually is the hot magma underneath the
crust.


<br><br>


He says that his calculations and
insider sources indicate that over a period of time, what is likely
to happen is that there will be a gradual crustal displacement that
will happen at about walking pace that will happen over a period of
several months.


<br><br>


Geologically, that&rsquo;s very, very
fast, but it doesn&rsquo;t make for a good disaster movie because the
continents will start to rearrange themselves at the rate of about
two kilometers an hour, a walking pace, something like that.


<br><br>


But after three months, everything is
going to be in a slightly different place. And then the weather&rsquo;s
going to change, and then the ice caps are going to melt, and then
the sea level&rsquo;s going to rearrange itself. He says that Japan
is probably going to disappear, and all kinds of things that are
pretty heavy duty, but the world&rsquo;s not going to end. It&rsquo;s
going to result in problems in the food distribution.


<br><br>


There&rsquo;s likely to be corona mass
ejections which will influence and affect anything that operates
electromagnetically.


<br><br>


We&rsquo;ve had insider information
ourselves at Camelot. We heard back in April [2009] from the wife of
an electrical engineer who had suddenly been briefed that he had
about three or four years to handle the problem of every transformer
in the British National Grid burning out.


<br><br>


We corresponded with the wife of this
guy. There were several emails over a three- or four-day period
because this guy was away.


<br><br>


And she said: <I>Look,
I can&rsquo;t answer your questions because I&rsquo;m not a scientist
and I&rsquo;ll put them to him as soon as he returns home.</I>



<br><br>


And we heard nothing else at all
because presumably &ndash; we can only assume and it felt absolutely
real &ndash; we could only assume that this guy got home and said:
<I>What the hell are you doing?</I>
<I>We can&rsquo;t talk to
anyone about this. It&rsquo;d be too dangerous, and I&rsquo;ve been
threatened. You can&rsquo;t do this. Please, you shouldn&rsquo;t have
talked to these people. </I>


<br><br>


And then we&rsquo;ve heard from other
people with very, very similar things. Bill Deagle confirms this.
There are electrical engineers all over the world working in the
public domain who&rsquo;ve already been briefed that they need to
take care of stuff that might possibly happen.

<br><br>


And the population reduction plans...
[laughs] This is such a big subject; it&rsquo;s very hard to go at it
in a linear way. The population reductions plans are basically...
See, the obvious question is: <I>Look,
if you&rsquo;re going to have significant Earth changes and a
breakdown in the infrastructure and a breakdown in food production,
and all of this, which are going to be life-threatening of
life-ending for a lot of people, why are they worried about reducing
the world&rsquo;s population at the same time through artificial
means, as they are? </I>


<br><br>


Deagle&rsquo;s response to this,
basically, is that it&rsquo;s a matter of timing. They&rsquo;re
trying to anticipate when these things will happen. They need to have
the world&rsquo;s population reduced by the <I>time</I>
that these things really kick in because otherwise their own survival
may be threatened by too many people running around doing
unpredictable things.


<br><br>


But before that, they don&rsquo;t want
to wipe people out too quickly, which is one of the reasons why they
may not have done it until now, because they want to keep up the
manufacturing base, which they&rsquo;re dependent on because the
gadgets which they use to keep them alive in their underground
bases... somebody&rsquo;s making these things; they&rsquo;re not
making them in their own factories. You and I are making these
things, metaphorically speaking.


<br><br>


So the people in the factories all
over the world need to be able to keep up their production. And so
it&rsquo;s a matter of keeping things going for as long as possible
and then just before the music stops, metaphorically speaking, then
they&rsquo;re going to say: <I>Okay,
you guys are not needed anymore. Now we start to reduce the world&rsquo;s
population.</I> And then the
Earth changes start and then they all go underground; and then
they&rsquo;ve got their <I>Plan
B</I> which is the bases on the
Moon and Mars.

<br><br>


Now, all of this, Deagle says, may
only start to pan out as late as 2019. He doesn&rsquo;t buy the 2012
thing at all, and I don&rsquo;t either. I suspect that the 2012 thing
is a big misdirect, and the very fact that we&rsquo;ve got this
Roland Emmerich movie coming out confirms to me that it&rsquo;s more
likely to be a misdirect. It&rsquo;s like: <I>Right.
If he&rsquo;s saying this, then something else is going to be
happening. </I>In the meantime,
we&rsquo;re all meant to be believing this.

<br><br>


But there&rsquo;s something going on,
and we and you and a whole bunch of other people who are watching
this movie right now are busy trying to figure this out. We&rsquo;re
not jumping on the bandwagon to claim that Bill Deagle is correct
about this, but he&rsquo;s very, very smart, he&rsquo;s very, very
well intentioned; he&rsquo;s got his own insider sources, and what he
was describing &ndash; which very soon after, if not before this
video is published, we will have that full hour and a half audio on
our site; it&rsquo;s the kind of thing you need to listen to three or
four times, because it&rsquo;s very, very intense &ndash; it rang
true to me. It rang true to me.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s not a disaster, but it&rsquo;s
a big change. It happens every 11,500 years, and was the same kind of
thing that we read about in the legends, as the legend of Atlantis,
the Great Flood, so on and so forth. A whole bunch of stuff happened.
But it wasn&rsquo;t a big wipeout; it was just a little bit of a
reset and a little bit of a reorganization. And a lot of the high
technology that existed back in those days disappeared.


<br><br>


And then that correlates, of course,
with what Hoagland has been saying all this time, which is really,
really interesting. He says all these ruins that are on Mars and on
other rocky moons. Iapetus, one of the moons of... is it Saturn or
Jupiter? I can&rsquo;t remember &ndash; it&rsquo;s got incredible
structures on it. [Ed note: Saturn]

<br><br>


I mean, the whole Solar System seems
to be littered with artifacts of different kinds. But he says it&rsquo;s
just humans having done their thing in previous ages. He says it&rsquo;s
not ETs building this stuff -- it&rsquo;s us. It&rsquo;s our history.
He said it&rsquo;s <I>our</I>
history! We don&rsquo;t know our own history. Very, very interesting
pieces.


<br><br>


Now, of course, there are probably ET
bases there as well. We heard from &lsquo;Henry Deacon&rsquo; (Arthur
Neumann) about the Mars base that&rsquo;s occupied, or rather,
jointly occupied, by human military, or human military intelligence,
whatever you want to call them. But there are other ETs there as
well. There&rsquo;s life and people, you know, people, everywhere.


<br><br>


But a lot of the stuff out there,
Hoagland claims, actually is us from previous ages. We&rsquo;ve been
out there and we&rsquo;ve left our ruins behind. I don&rsquo;t know
whether it&rsquo;s true or not. It&rsquo;s a fascinating thesis, and
Deagle is not... Let me put this right: Deagle is not in disagreement
about this. We do want to point people towards Bill Deagle&rsquo;s
work.


<br><br>


And a lot of people say that he&rsquo;s
a fear-monger, and a lot of people say that David Icke is a
fear-monger. And actually I introduced David on Saturday by saying
that he&rsquo;s one of the most positive, optimistic, courageous
people that you could ever think of. And he says that the idea that
this might all have a bad ending never really occurs to him. And
Deagle is exactly the same.


<br><br>


But he&rsquo;s not saying, and David
Icke isn&rsquo;t saying, that we&rsquo;re not going to have a tough
time. We may have a tough time. And some people may have to drop
their bodies and pick up another one somewhere.


<br><br>


But that&rsquo;s not the end of the
game, and that doesn&rsquo;t make it all into a disaster movie; it
makes for quite a lot of drama and quite a lot of change and quite a
lot of interesting things going on.


<br><br>


But in the biggest picture, after all
this, there actually is the opportunity for the human race to emerge
into what many, many psychics have seen as being, after all of this
chaos, some kind of a Golden Age which will emerge.

<br><br>


And one of the messages that I want to
give here is that if this was all going to be a dreadful, terrible
story, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here. You see, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here. I
know that. I wouldn&rsquo;t be here. I wouldn&rsquo;t have come here
in 1953 to do what I&rsquo;m doing now. I would&rsquo;ve gone off to
some other planet&hellip; I mean, there are all kinds of wonderful
places to be out there where you can really have a lot of fun doing a
lot of different things.


<br><br>


I&rsquo;m here because there&rsquo;s a
good chance that this game is going to result in a good outcome. In
the meantime it&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s interesting, it&rsquo;s a
learning experience, it&rsquo;s a training course for you and me, and
everyone else too. I&rsquo;m really pleased that I volunteered for
this, but I didn&rsquo;t volunteer for a dead end.


<br><br>


And all the wonderful children who are
coming in, who they&rsquo;re trying to control with Ritalin and all
these drugs and all these&hellip; you know, I mean, all the Indigo
children, they&rsquo;re coming in in waves and waves. The cavalry is
coming. They&rsquo;re little kids running around &ndash; the cavalry
is here!


<br><br>


We get letters from people, we get
e-mails to Project Camelot. We get more and more letters from younger
and younger people, people who are in their teens, people who are in
their early 20s, and they have levels of awareness and information
which they&rsquo;re holding in their understanding that I never had
when I was that age.


<br><br>


When I was 20, even when I was 30, I
hadn&rsquo;t got a clue what was going on! I had no idea at all! I
was trying to figure it all out. And these guys are really on the
ball. Some of them can&rsquo;t spell very well, but that&rsquo;s not
important!

<br><br>


We have so many people saying: <I>I
know I&rsquo;m here for a reason. I want to find out what I&rsquo;m
here for. I understand all this information. Your information has
helped to wake me up. Your information has helped me realize that I&rsquo;m
here</I>&hellip; You know. We
get this from more and more people, and younger and younger people.


<br><br>


And of course we&rsquo;re working as
part of a huge team. You&rsquo;re going to start getting these
messages as well, if you haven&rsquo;t already started to get them.


<br><br>


FC:  Yes. Mm-hm.

<br><br>


BR:  And there are people working all
over the world in different cultures, in different ways, and all of
this is happening. It&rsquo;s a movement. It&rsquo;s a movement.


<br><br>


And all of these young kids, they
would not be here if this was a dead-end, fixed, rigged game. They&rsquo;d
have gone to another table, another planet. They&rsquo;d be doing
something else. They wouldn&rsquo;t be here. They&rsquo;re here
because there&rsquo;s a good chance&hellip; because it&rsquo;s fun,
because we&rsquo;re working together, because they can reconnect with
people who they&rsquo;ve got an agreement to reconnect with.


<br><br>


Many of us have known each other
before. This is why, I&rsquo;m sure, that since you started doing
what you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;ve been bumping into people who
you&rsquo;ve only met for one or two days, and you think: <I>My
God, I felt I&rsquo;ve known you all my life!</I>



<br><br>


It happens all the time! And the
reason for that is &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re not strangers, they&rsquo;re
old friends. You have an agreement; it&rsquo;s part of the life-plan
to meet up and work together because this is what you&rsquo;ve done
many times before. The reason why it&rsquo;s fun to work with people
is because it was fun last time. So here we go again.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s like a long series of
movies, where you get the same characters again, faced with a
different problem, and here we go. You know? And that really is the
way that it is.


<br><br>


And so, that, for me, is one of the
most important messages of hope that there is, that this whole
cavalry wouldn&rsquo;t be investing themselves here if it was all
hopeless. They&rsquo;re investing themselves here because there&rsquo;s
something really valuable that could come out of this.

<br><br>


I don&rsquo;t think anything&rsquo;s
fixed. It&rsquo;s not fixed to have a good outcome; it&rsquo;s not
fixed to have a bad outcome. But it&rsquo;s a fascinating game. And
my message to anyone who&rsquo;s watching this, who feels that
this... that what I&rsquo;m saying is <I>saying</I>
anything to them... is you are probably watching this video right now
for a reason. Nothing happens by accident. If you find yourself
thinking: <I>What should I be
doing? What should I be being? </I>[laughs]
Even if German is your language and you&rsquo;re fascinated by Ruth&rsquo;s
book, then that&rsquo;s a good place to start.


<br><br>


Whatever it is that you feel drawn to
do at this moment, then that could be what it is that you&rsquo;re
here to do. Be smart, be careful, check things out with people, be
aware for all the tricks you possibly can do, but follow your
instinct. If you spend all your time trying to think it out
logically, you&rsquo;re not going to get anywhere. You&rsquo;ve got
to jump off the cliff. The angels will catch you because the angels
are real.

<br><br>


FC:  Brilliant, that&rsquo;s
excellent, thank you Bill. I just want to go back to the question of
please tell us about who&rsquo;s actually running this planet. Is it
the Reptilians?

<br><br>


BR:  [laughs]

<br><br>


FC:  Who is it&hellip; what&rsquo;s
going on?

<br><br>


BR:  Okay. Okay. Who&rsquo;s running
the planet? The Anunnaki are part of the picture. The Anunnaki are an
interesting bunch of people. There is a lot which I don&rsquo;t know
about them. And these seem to be a good example of what I was talking
about a little earlier in this conversation, that rather than saying:
<I>Oh, my God, these are people
that we&rsquo;ve got to worship, or we&rsquo;ve got to fight, or
we&rsquo;ve got to propitiate to, or we&rsquo;ve got to appease, or
we&rsquo;ve got to negotiate with,</I>
actually maybe they&rsquo;re people who came here with a problem.


<br><br>


And there is information from
different sources, including some of my own information, which feels
real &ndash; and I&rsquo;ve heard this elsewhere &ndash; is that they
may have lost their planet. Because bad things happen out there. It&rsquo;s
a violent universe.


<br><br>


For any race of beings, any advanced
race of beings that loses a planet, that&rsquo;s a tough problem to
solve because it&rsquo;s like somebody losing their house in an
earthquake and then wandering around wondering where they can live.
They think: <I>Oh, that&rsquo;s
a nice house, and that&rsquo;s a nice house</I>,
but everyone&rsquo;s already living in the nice houses, you know.


<br><br>


Now, this is a very poor analogy. You
can&rsquo;t just wander into a beautiful empty house. All the
beautiful planets are already occupied. They&rsquo;ve already got
people, or beings, who seem to be there.


<br><br>


Now it&rsquo;s possible that &ndash;
and I present this as a hypothesis &ndash; it may be that they&rsquo;re
working through their own karmic history as a race. Just supposing a
planet was destroyed, then the race had nowhere to go; but because
they hadn&rsquo;t been very nice to people before that, nobody wants
to take them on board as refugees. Then they&rsquo;ve got a problem.


<br><br>


One of the things that Clay and Sean
Pickering said&hellip; now, they don&rsquo;t know anything about the
Anunnaki, this is highly compartmentalized. I think that at least
some of the Anunnaki, or the people who are called the Anunnaki, are
Reptilians. And remember that the word &ldquo;Anunnaki&rdquo;, as
translated by Sitchin, simply means &ldquo;those who came from heaven
to Earth&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s like a generic term for
extraterrestrials, really, visitors. They don&rsquo;t call themselves
the &ldquo;Anunnaki.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know what they call
themselves.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s possible that these are
refugees looking for a place to squat, a place to take over, people
to negotiate with, a role to play, a place to be &ndash; I don&rsquo;t
know.


<br><br>


If we imagine that there&rsquo;s a
race that lost their planet, they&rsquo;re likely to be heavily
traumatized, they&rsquo;re likely to be split into different groups,
they&rsquo;re likely to have disagreements between themselves about
what they should do. Some of those beings, some of those people,
might say: <I>Okay, we should
ask for help</I>. Others might
say: <I>No, we&rsquo;re a
warrior race. We just go in and invade those people. We have no
respect for them anyway, and besides, we like their real estate. </I>


<br><br>


[FC laughs]

<br><br>


We&rsquo;ve been told that the
Anunnaki have split into a number of different factions, and actually
they don&rsquo;t necessarily get along well with each other. Some of
them may well be friendly. Some of them may not be.


<br><br>


I met Barbara Lamb, who is a therapist
who works with contactees. She&rsquo;s widely respected; she&rsquo;s
a wonderful person. I met her in Los Angeles in February. And she
told me that a Reptilian had materialized in her room, physically,
held her hand for two minutes, looked her in the eye, and gave her
the information that he had been bred as part of a program to
communicate with people, chosen people, with the message that they
are not all unfriendly. That was his role, and Barbara Lamb
understood this because she&rsquo;s heard all of these stories.


<br><br>


You know, just because somebody&rsquo;s
eight feet tall with muscles and scales and green&hellip; I mean, I
don&rsquo;t know what they look like, you know. They probably look
pretty frightening. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean to say that they&rsquo;re
not nice people.


<br><br>


As Ruth said, the bottom line, once
you disentangle all of this mess that we&rsquo;ve got down here at
this level of reality, everyone is infinite consciousness. Even a
nasty Reptilian who eats babies. They&rsquo;re infinite consciousness
too. They&rsquo;ve just forgotten who they are, just like you and I
have, maybe.


<br><br>


And so there&rsquo;s room for
compassion in this. This is where the infinite love thing fits in.
See, there&rsquo;s room for compassion, there&rsquo;s room for
realizing that these guys might have a big problem. Most people who
do something that&rsquo;s antisocial or violent or nasty, they&rsquo;re
just trying to solve a problem.


<br><br>


If somebody holds you up at knifepoint
down a dark alley and steals your wallet, they&rsquo;re just trying
to solve a problem. If somebody bombs another country, they&rsquo;re
just trying to solve a problem. If somebody takes over a planet,
they&rsquo;re just trying to solve a problem. If your partner screams
at you and throws a plate at you in the kitchen because they&rsquo;re
upset, they&rsquo;re just trying to solve a problem.

<br><br>


They&rsquo;re just self-medicating by
doing something that makes them feel better. So any bad thing that
anyone ever does is just they&rsquo;re trying to solve a problem.
It&rsquo;s just that, usually, when these things result in a negative
effect on somebody else, it doesn&rsquo;t really finally solve the
problem, it&rsquo;s just very temporary. It just feels like they&rsquo;re
solving a problem. It doesn&rsquo;t actually end the whole thing.


<br><br>


This is what karma is. Karma is trying
to solve a problem in a way that creates another problem, creates
another problem, creates another problem, creates another problem,
and the whole thing never ends. You&rsquo;ve got to lift yourself up
to a higher level to realize how to really handle these problems, not
try and solve them by react, react. So, so much about that.


<br><br>


But this is where compassion comes
into this, that rather than fighting these guys, we&rsquo;ve got to
understand that they may be here because they&rsquo;re trying to
solve a problem, and they&rsquo;re trying to solve a problem in a way
that might not be good for their karma, and might not be good for us
physically.


<br><br>


Now, you asked me who&rsquo;s running
this show. It&rsquo;s certainly very real for me that there are
Reptilian entities who are operating behind, or operating <I>within</I>,
senior figures who are influential in this whole chess game that is
modern geopolitics; and also in the alternative media world as well.

<br><br>


If you&rsquo;ve got Reptilians who are
smart enough to take over a human body, in whatever metaphorical way
you can imagine &ndash; they might stand behind them in another
dimension; they might be like what is called a <I>walk-in</I>,
where they say: <I>Okay, out of
here, I&rsquo;m taking over this body now</I>
-- and they look like a human, but who they were before that was
something completely different. This can happen at any stage of one&rsquo;s
life; you don&rsquo;t have to be born in here.


<br><br>


That may happen with politicians, it
may happen with bankers, it might happen with industrialists, it
might happen with UFO researchers. In theory, if we don&rsquo;t watch
our backs, it could happen to you and me. These are the kind of
things which, if you regard these beings as having the ability and
the strategic capability to figure out: <I>Okay,
what position should we occupy on this chessboard?</I>
Then they are going to be occupying positions and they&rsquo;re going
to be occupying people. It&rsquo;s absolutely logical that if they
could do that, they would do that.


<br><br>


And not only are the bad guys
occupying positions and occupying people, the good guys are occupying
positions and occupying people. Who do you think we are? Now, before,
I was saying how I was in Tibet for a long time. I think I&rsquo;ve
been on this planet for&hellip; I mean, I haven&rsquo;t got any
memories earlier than about 2,000 years ago, but maybe I just came in
a little bit early, just to get used to it. If I came here to planet
Earth from somewhere else, hanging out in Tibet to get the hang of it
is actually a pretty nice place to do one&rsquo;s induction, before
you really start to get involved in it.

<br><br>


I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but I
know that some people have come straight in here; this is their first
lifetime. I&rsquo;ve talked to them.


<br><br>


I had another girlfriend, this is a
story I haven&rsquo;t told publicly, I won&rsquo;t give her name,
because she could easily watch this. I had another girlfriend who had
come here from the Pleiades two lifetimes ago &ndash; not last
lifetime. In other words, this lifetime is her second human lifetime.
The previous lifetime, just like us, she had a really, really tough
time. She had a very, very tough time. Because if you come here from
anywhere, it&rsquo;s tough. This is a tough planet! [laughs] It&rsquo;s
not easy to be here.


<br><br>


Especially if you&rsquo;re used to
other ways of operating, other levels of technology, other abilities
that one might have that you have to give up when you&rsquo;re here
because things don&rsquo;t work that way, with human bodies and human
brains, because the brain is the interface.


<br><br>


The brain&rsquo;s got something to do
with telepathy, even if it&rsquo;s a fundamental spiritual ability.
Hardware and software work together. You can have advanced software,
but if the hardware&rsquo;s not right, the software won&rsquo;t work.
So, that&rsquo;s got something to do with it.


<br><br>


Now, this is all part of your question
about who&rsquo;s running the planet. Behind the scenes here there is
an invisible game going on &ndash; I won&rsquo;t use the word &ldquo;war&rdquo;.
There are good aliens and there are bad aliens, and they&rsquo;re
very, very probably occupying human conditions and playing things
out. And they&rsquo;re probably hunting each other.


<br><br>


When Bob Dean said that there are
human-looking aliens walking the halls of the Pentagon, and some of
them are being hunted... which is what we were told by our source who
we call John Robie, who is a character in a movie [Ed note: <I>To
Catch a Thief</I>], because we
like calling our pseudonyms characters in movies &ndash; he was Tony
Dodd, who has now passed on. He was a very well known British UFO
researcher, very widely respected, a wonderful man. I never met him
personally.


<br><br>


He communicated to us quite intensely.
He said these guys are being hunted down. What he never told us,
specifically &ndash; probably because he never knew &ndash; is, is it
the good guys who are being hunted down by the bad guys, or the bad
guys who are being hunted down by the good guys? You see?


<br><br>


FC:  The bad guys are being hunted
down by the good guys?

<br><br>


BR:  Or the other way around.


<br><br>


FC:  Oh&hellip;

<br><br>


BR:  Or possibly both, you know. Who
knows what&rsquo;s going on out there? It&rsquo;s just the idea that
when Tony Dodd reported during our site as John Robie, and confirmed
by Bob Dean, saying that there is one race &ndash; this is pretty
much what Bob Dean said from memory &ndash; he said that there is one
race which he has been told about that looks exactly like us. You
wouldn&rsquo;t notice them if they stepped next to you in the train.
You&rsquo;d never notice them if you met them at a party. You&rsquo;d
never notice them if you were working for them or with them, or had
them working for you, or if they applied for a job in military
intelligence. You wouldn&rsquo;t notice... they&rsquo;re just <I>human!</I>

<br><br>


And, bridging slightly over that, this
is something that &lsquo;Henry Deacon&rsquo;  (Arthur Neumann) said
over and over again. He said: <I>They&rsquo;re
humans! There&rsquo;re people out there. They&rsquo;re just like us.
Some of them look a little bit different, some of them have slightly
different skin, some of them are big, some of them are small, some of
them have got different-shaped eyes. </I>


<br><br>


But, hell, we have that on Planet
Earth as well! Why do you think we all look so different? It&rsquo;s
because we&rsquo;ve got genetic components from all these other
different races and they&rsquo;re all slightly different. But
fundamentally, maybe with the odd exception, you know, they&rsquo;ve
all got two arms, two legs, a head, two ears, two eyes, a nose and a
mouth, and a brain that&rsquo;s up here, and they&rsquo;ve got their
own chakra system and they&rsquo;ve got their own biology.


<br><br>


But they&rsquo;re pretty much human.
It seems to be the template, for this Galaxy at least, maybe with one
or two exceptions. And if some of those humans are so similar to us
that you couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re
here. They&rsquo;re probably very brave volunteers doing their own
thing, and if any one of those is watching this video, come contact
us, because we&rsquo;d like to interview you! [laughs]

<br><br>


FC:  I personally want to interview a
Reptilian... if they can speak.


<br><br>


BR:  Ahhh, yes, you&rsquo;d probably
have to have an intermediary to pick up their telepathic contact. One
of the things, going back to... now, this whole thing isn&rsquo;t
going in a straight line, but what Clay and Shawn Pickering told us
was that the Disclosure program, which they have been told about by
their US Navy source in great detail, concerns two extraterrestrial
races. They didn&rsquo;t know about any of the others. They said
nobody knows what the Grays are doing. They&rsquo;re doing their own
thing. &lsquo;Henry Deacon&rsquo; told us that. He said: <I>We
don&rsquo;t know what those guys are doing. They&rsquo;re doing their
own thing</I>.<I>
</I>Quite interesting.

<br><br>


He [Clay and Shawn Pickering&rsquo;s
source] talked about a Reptilian race who are subservient to another
race, which is a silicon-based life form that is <I>not</I>
humanoid. That it&rsquo;s got tremendous abilities, but is so alien
in every sense of the word that it&rsquo;s really hard to understand
what it is that they want, how they operate, anything about them at
all, because it&rsquo;s a totally different paradigm.


<br><br>


They&rsquo;re just crystals. They&rsquo;re
crystals! Basically, they&rsquo;re crystals that can apparently move
and levitate and communicate telepathically, and they can change
their shape, because just like you&rsquo;d imagine a big clever
crystal would, it just grows something outside of it, which is
another part of the crystal.

<br><br>


I don&rsquo;t know much about this,
and it&rsquo;s a very wild story, and they don&rsquo;t like the
environment of planet Earth because it doesn&rsquo;t suit their
bodies very well. And so this is a novelty in terms of UFO
researchers, in terms of UFO research. And they&rsquo;ve had a bit of
a tough time with their story because everyone says: <I>Oh,
this is crazy; this is nonsense.</I>
So they don&rsquo;t have many people who are believing them.


<br><br>


But their source, their US Navy
source, is part of a team of six who has been surgically modified,
which apparently is quite a traumatic process, been surgically
modified to be able to communicate with these beings, and he&rsquo;s
had deep interaction with them.


<br><br>


But one of the reasons why there are
debates about whether to trust them [meaning these crystalline ETs]
or not is because they don&rsquo;t answer many questions, and they
don&rsquo;t reveal many facts. But people&hellip; but everyone just
feels wonderful when they&rsquo;re in their presence and they seem to
be benevolent, but they&rsquo;re also withholding a lot of
information.


<br><br>


But they&rsquo;re <I>alien!</I>
How do you figure this out? Everyone&rsquo;s still trying to work it
out. Nobody knows. There&rsquo;s more about this in this big
interview, a four-hour interview [with Clay and Shawn Pickering].


<br><br>


The race that&rsquo;s subservient to
them is a Reptilian race. He said that their source believes that
they suffered an Extinction Level Event; they lost their planet. He
says &ndash; this is their source; when I say &ldquo;he&rdquo; I&rsquo;m
referring to their source; we haven&rsquo;t met them directly, we&rsquo;ve
been invited to meet them, we haven&rsquo;t met them &ndash; he says
that the Reptilians, all they want to do is to walk around.


<br><br>


All they want to do is to walk around.
They spend their life in big spaceships. They don&rsquo;t have a
planet... apparently. It fits; it sort of fits.


<br><br>


What do they look like? He said
imagine a miniature T-Rex: big teeth, a tail, and scales. They weigh
500 kilograms (1,000 pounds), two and a half meters tall (eight feet
high). They&rsquo;re very, very strong. They are a warrior race.
They&rsquo;re highly intelligent. They&rsquo;re very ruthless.

<br><br>


Another source of ours has described
these beings as: imagine the instincts and the ethical level of
responsibility of a crocodile, but with very high intelligence. They
don&rsquo;t think the way that humans do.


<br><br>


Once again going back to David Icke,
David Icke was saying just a couple of days ago, he also was
referring to these beings as they, in his terminology<I>:
they operate through mind, they operate through a program, they will
do whatever is expedient, they will do whatever is practical, they
will do whatever is in their own interests, and they don&rsquo;t have
any empathy, they don&rsquo;t have any sympathy.</I>

<br><br>


It sort of fits that behind all of
that &ndash; and this is where we go back to what Ruth was saying,
which is absolutely true &ndash; behind all of that, you&rsquo;ve got
some form of cycle of abuse that has made them into what they&hellip;
These are tough kids on the block. We have children like that too,
almost. Almost. Some of them. You don&rsquo;t want to come near them
on a dark night, you&rsquo;d be better off with a crocodile. Some of
them.


<br><br>


But behind them, they&rsquo;ve
experienced something that has made them into that. They&rsquo;ve had
a tough time, and this is their response. They&rsquo;re trying to
survive in the world that they think is unsympathetic to them. This
is just their response. They&rsquo;re trying to solve their own
problem by being in a certain way. <I>Maybe.</I>



<br><br>


These Reptilian characters, he says
that the difference between them and a T-Rex is that... if you
remember what a T-Rex looks like, they&rsquo;ve got these little
vestigial arms; these guys have got longer arms with very dexterous
fingers. So they&rsquo;re tool-makers, you see.


<br><br>


If you think of the evolution of a
biological species, you&rsquo;ve got to go through the tool-making
phase. This is why dolphins haven&rsquo;t evolved high technology,
because they can&rsquo;t make tools. They&rsquo;ve got no fingers,
they&rsquo;ve got no hands. All they can do is make noises and play
complicated games and swim around in the sea. They&rsquo;ll never be
an industrial race, or an electronic race, because you&rsquo;ve got
to go through that phase by making things.

<br><br>


And they have been through this phase
of making things. They&rsquo;re highly intelligent; they&rsquo;re
highly able, post-industrial. They have space flight, they have the
whole thing.

<br><br>


And what I do not know is whether
these are the same as the Anunnaki. What we do know about the
Anunnaki&hellip; And I had a fascinating conversation with David Icke
about this. I keep on talking about David Icke because he&rsquo;s a
reference point that many people watching this video will recognize
and be familiar with, and I had a fascinating conversation with
David. I was telling him all that we heard about the Reptilians and
the Anunnaki, and he was telling us, and it was absolutely matching
totally.

<br><br>


One of the characteristics is that
when they are in contact, in physical contact, they will not reveal
what they look like. They regard their appearance in a ritualistic
way, or a way that has become ritualistic, as sacred. It&rsquo;s part
of their custom and ritual and fixed way of operating that you cannot
look at their face, or that we cannot look, or humans can&rsquo;t
look on their face. It&rsquo;s not done.


<br><br>


 And &lsquo;Henry Deacon&rsquo;
(Arthur Neumann), who has encountered these characters physically, in
the flesh &ndash; he never saw their faces because they&rsquo;re all
wearing cloaks and headdresses and funny stuff like that... this is
what they do. They&rsquo;re very ceremonial. It&rsquo;s an ancient
culture which has ritual deeply engrained in everything which they
do. Why not? They can do anything they like. They&rsquo;re aliens.

<br><br>


And when David Icke was describing how
the ritual, and the status, and the sense of axiomatic importance
that is ascribed to royalty, &ldquo;the Divine Right of Kings&rdquo;
and all the rest of it, this all comes from the Anunnaki. This is how
they regard themselves.


<br><br>


And when you meet them, it&rsquo;s
like meeting a king, or like meeting a queen. You&rsquo;ve got to
talk in a certain way, you&rsquo;ve got to avert your eyes, you&rsquo;ve
got to hold your hands in a certain way, you&rsquo;ve got to approach
them in a certain way. You&rsquo;ve got to do everything in a certain
way. Otherwise, our source said... I don&rsquo;t think it was a joke;
he said: <I>If you don&rsquo;t
do it right, you end up on their dinner plate. </I>


<br><br>


[laughs] It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s
a certain way that you go about all of this. You&rsquo;ve got to
defer to them, you&rsquo;ve got to, you know&hellip; But what&rsquo;s
really, really interesting is that if this is the same group as Clay
and Shawn Pickering are talking about, and they describe these guys
in great detail &ndash; you know, you can see them when they&rsquo;re
describing them; they describe them vividly &ndash; they are
subservient to this silicon-based life form. And the hypothesis is
that the silicon-based life form rescued them when they destroyed
their planet. So, somehow they&rsquo;re operating symbiotically.


<br><br>


Everything that I said here raises a
huge number of questions, and I don&rsquo;t have the answers to them.
I don&rsquo;t know whether these Reptilians are shape-shifters.


<br><br>


The silicon-based race, apparently
they can shape-shift, but they don&rsquo;t shape-shift physically;
they affect the perception in the brains or the minds of the people
watching. So when this guy, when this source, the first time that he
came across one of these things, if I remember rightly, he was with a
group of people in a room, and he was announcing that he was going to
have an important meeting.


<br><br>


And he went to the middle of these
people in this room and he was briefed by a senior military officer
for five minutes, until the military officer then became this big
crystal... because it wasn&rsquo;t a military officer at all! They
<I>perceived</I>
a military officer.

<br><br>


And what was really interesting is
that all of those people in that group saw something slightly
different because this was a mental perception. And then they were
completely confused by this. They all went off into another room and
compared: <I>Well, this is what
I saw. What did you see? Well, he was wearing brown shoes. No, he
wasn&rsquo;t, he was wearing black shoes.</I>
You know... <I>He was two
meters tall. No, he wasn&rsquo;t, he was quite short.</I>
You know...

<br><br>


But they [the men] saw a person. And
the rest of it was something to do with what they were sort of
expecting. It was an individual response to something that they were
being evoked to see, or evoked to sense and hear. But they [the
silicon life form] can only maintain it for about five minutes, then
they collapse into their real state, which is a physical state.


<br><br>


The question immediately to their
source was: <I>Well, is this
some kind of a hologram or an illusion, or a&hellip;? </I>


<br><br>


And: <I>No,
it&rsquo;s absolutely physical. They&rsquo;re a rock. They&rsquo;re a
rock in a suit. </I>


<br><br>


You know. It&rsquo;s a really weird
thing. He said: <I>They&rsquo;re
a rock! Y</I>ou know.
[laughing] He couldn&rsquo;t&hellip; So it&rsquo;s a big crystal
thing. It&rsquo;s straight out of some bad science fiction movie.
It&rsquo;s not what you expect. But they have the capacity to
influence how they&rsquo;re perceived for short periods of time.
Fascinating stuff. Absolutely fascinating.

<br><br>


And the Reptilians, if it&rsquo;s the
same group of Reptilians, are subservient to them. The silicon-based
groups don&rsquo;t seem to hang around on planet Earth; they&rsquo;re
out there somewhere.


<br><br>


And nobody knows where they&rsquo;re
<I>from</I>.
This is another problem. They&rsquo;re not answering the question
where they&rsquo;re from. I need to listen to the interview again,
but I think the response is something like: <I>You
wouldn&rsquo;t understand</I>.
Which isn&rsquo;t very helpful. It may be true, but it&rsquo;s still
not helpful.


<br><br>


And there may be different branches of
the Reptilians, but the Reptilians are a theme. They are a theme.
They&rsquo;re coming up over and over again. There are people who&rsquo;ve
encountered them, there are people who&rsquo;ve been contacted by
them, there are people who&rsquo;ve had experiences like Barbara Lamb
had, there are the shape-shifting experiences.


<br><br>


In our most recent interview with
Jordan Maxwell, bless him, he came out saying: <I>David
Icke should not be persecuted for what people perceive as being his
&ldquo;crazy ideas.&rdquo; He is absolutely right in what he says.
I&rsquo;ve had the same reports. They&rsquo;re separate reports.</I>



<br><br>


And then he told this incredible story
about this girl who had been left alone in the house in an American
military base &ndash; I mean, this is straight out of Hitchcock, or
something worse &ndash; you know, looking in the mirror; behind,
there&rsquo;s this Reptilian being who steps out of the closet and
starts gliding across the carpet towards her!


<br><br>


And this is a twelve-year-old... I
think it is a young daughter of an American military officer, with
guards around the house because this guy knew that there was some
kind of a threat, but didn&rsquo;t know what the threat was. And this
thing came from a closet! Left big scratch marks on the door,
straight out of a bad movie, and then disappeared. This girl was
completely freaked out, and Jordan got this story from the girl, who
is now a woman, telling this.


<br><br>


This happened on an American military
base. These things happen all time, they can&rsquo;t control it. Just
stepping into a dimensional portal, they can control where they
appear. This is why they appear in cupboards and funny places like
this, otherwise they&rsquo;d pop in the middle of a cocktail party.
That doesn&rsquo;t work. So, you know. Or in the middle of a street,
or in the middle of a shopping mall. No, they always appear in
cupboards and things. Or little corners, or basements, or, you know.
They can control where they appear, when they do appear.


<br><br>


And the rest of the time they&rsquo;re
here manipulating one of the chess pieces on this chess board, which
is a prominent figure whose role it is to influence other people. So
it&rsquo;s a perfect strategy. This is why some of them are
politicians, this is why some of them are industrialists, they&rsquo;re
probably in the media and they&rsquo;re probably in UFO research.

<br><br>


If I was a Reptilian with an agenda
like that, that&rsquo;s exactly the pieces that I would occupy. It
makes perfect sense, and it makes for a great movie.


<br><br>


FC:  Yes, doesn&rsquo;t it.

<br><br>


BR:  Okay.

<br><br>


FC:  Tell me, are they actually eating
the children?

<br><br>


BR:  Some people say so. In Bill
Deagle&rsquo;s 2006 Granada Forum lecture, there&rsquo;s a part where
he says: <I>I could tell you
what they do, but I&rsquo;m not going to because I would fall apart.
</I>Bill Deagle is a good man.
He couldn&rsquo;t talk about what he knew. He couldn&rsquo;t talk
about what he knew. He was in the middle of a presentation.


<br><br>


&lsquo;Henry Deacon&rsquo; (Arthur
Neumann) told us that in his place of work, in his classified place
of work, we know where that was, he attended a briefing all about
this subject, and he walked out of the briefing because he couldn&rsquo;t
stomach it. He told us he was amazed at two things: one of them, he
was amazed at how everyone was just sitting there listening to this
and taking notes. And he was also amazed that nobody stopped him from
walking out.

<br><br>


FC:  What did they tell him?

<br><br>


BR:  He was hinting heavily. Like many
insiders who&rsquo;ve got something important to say, he will talk
indirectly about it. And the way that he alerted us to this story
was, we were sitting in a restaurant with him, talking about all of
this stuff... we&rsquo;ve spent hours and hours and hours and hours
and hours with him, met him on many, many occasions, and we&rsquo;d
often meet him for dinner. And he was making a reference to a short
story, a short science fiction story which I read many years ago, but
I can&rsquo;t remember if it was by Philip K. Dick or if it was by
Heinlein, or whoever it was, but the title of the story was <I>To
Serve Man.</I> [Ed note: the
author was Damon Knight.]<I> </I>


<br><br>


This is the story. And it was a little
bit of a silly short story, and most science fiction short stories
are about 12 pages long, and they&rsquo;re quite fun and they&rsquo;ve
got a little punch line, and you&rsquo;ve got maybe 20 of them in a
book. And this story was called <I>To
Serve Man</I>.


<br><br>


And the theme was these aliens had
appeared, and it had been discovered that, in some document that
somebody had seen with them, that there was this document that said,
&ldquo;To Serve Man&rdquo;.


<br><br>


And people were saying: <I>Oh,
this is great -- they&rsquo;ve come here to serve us. They&rsquo;ve
come here to</I>, you know, <I>to
help us, to assist us</I>. And
it actually turned out that what it really meant; they were going to
serve us up on a plate. It&rsquo;s actually a very bad play on words.

<br><br>


And &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; (Arthur) was
making pointed references to this as he looked in the menu of this
meal, and I didn&rsquo;t get it, and Kerry didn&rsquo;t get it. We
didn&rsquo;t really get what he was talking about. And he kept on
make&hellip; He was becoming more and more pointed, and more and more
pointed, until he virtually had to spell it out for us. When he
realized that we&rsquo;d understood that there were at least some of
these aliens who are eating people, then he said: <I>Okay,
I don&rsquo;t need to talk about that anymore.</I>

<br><br>


And it seems to be a theme. And one of
the problems in this whole research area is that &ndash; and it&rsquo;s
also the problem with the president of any country going out towards
the press and saying: <I>Oh,
yeah, Roswell was real</I>. &ndash;
it&rsquo;s like after half an hour, or an hour, or two hours, or two
days or two weeks, someone then starts asking the question: <I>Well,
we&rsquo;ve heard about this. Is this true?</I>
You see. And it goes to unsavory places. It goes to places that you
don&rsquo;t want to go.


<br><br>


Our research takes us to these places.
Our research takes us to what the Illuminati are doing, to what&rsquo;s
happening to the Vatican, to what the Reptilians are doing, to
extremely nasty places where I never&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to go
to those places. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like fun anymore, really, when
you&rsquo;re looking at all this stuff. You think: <I>Oh,
God, I don&rsquo;t want to deal with this stuff! It&rsquo;s not nice!</I>

<br><br>


But if one is going to be a really,
really honest researcher, you&rsquo;ve got to follow the data trail.
And this is what David Icke does, this is what Bill Deagle does, it&rsquo;s
not what everybody does. Some people say: <I>Nah,
I&rsquo;m not going to go there. I&rsquo;m only going to talk about
nice aliens.</I> Or:<I>
I&rsquo;m only going to talk about Earth changes -- I&rsquo;m not
going to talk about aliens at all.</I>
Or: <I>I&rsquo;m only going to
talk about what the politicians are doing, or what the economy is
doing.</I>

<br><br>


But if you look at it from a high
enough place, you see that all of these things are interconnected,
even the nasty stuff. And this is where, again, when you go back to
David&rsquo;s opening statement, and Ruth&rsquo;s opening statement,
if you hold that line, that we are infinitely capable, infinitely
wonderful, infinitely beautiful spiritual beings, and all else is
illusion, drama, and play, <I>maya</I>,
then you can handle it. It&rsquo;s like: <I>Oh,
okay </I>[snaps fingers], <I>you
know, it doesn&rsquo;t feel very nice but</I>
[snaps fingers] <I>it&rsquo;s
just one of those things in a dream that just feels a bit, yuck, you
know, and then you move on.</I>

<br><br>


It&rsquo;s the only real way to handle
it. How you communicate about it to people who don&rsquo;t have that
viewpoint, I don&rsquo;t know.


<br><br>


FC:  Do you ever come across
disinformationists when you&rsquo;re interviewing people? People who
try to feed you deliberate disinformation? How do you suss them out,
and how do you vet your witnesses?

<br><br>


BR:  Hmm. What a question. I don&rsquo;t
believe, I don&rsquo;t believe &ndash; I&rsquo;m choosing my words
carefully here &ndash; I don&rsquo;t believe that there has been very
much deliberate disinformation in any of our interviews.


<br><br>


And I&rsquo;ll qualify that: that
doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything that we are reporting, we believe
is correct. Some of it <I>has</I>
to be wrong, because you&rsquo;ve got people contradicting each
other. You&rsquo;ve got Dan Burisch saying that there are only three
races visiting us, and Clifford Stone saying there are 57 and
probably more. Someone&rsquo;s got to be wrong.


<br><br>


But they both believe that they&rsquo;re
right. They both really do believe that they&rsquo;re right. And one
thing I want to say here about Dan Burisch is he believes everything
that he&rsquo;s told us. He&rsquo;s not lying to us. He believes it,
but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s true.


<br><br>


As Richard Hoagland said very
graphically in his interview to us and to other people: <I>The
lie is different at every level.</I>
And why would we believe that disinformation doesn&rsquo;t also work
on the inside?

<br><br>


One of the things that they do, and I
learned this a long time ago, is that... Let me think of an example.
I&rsquo;m actually going back to the Serpo story, because this is
where I had some people who first helped me to understand this. For
example, if there&rsquo;s one source who said: <I>Twelve
people went on this mission</I>;
and then another source, on the inside, says: <I>Ten
people went on this mission</I>;
another source says: <I>Six
people went on this mission,</I>
and these are informal briefings, it&rsquo;s actually not very
important, it&rsquo;s just a little bit of information.


<br><br>


Then if any of that information leaks
out, they know where it came from. If it&rsquo;s the story where six
people went on the mission that then leaks out onto the Internet,
then they know that it was the guy who was told that it was six who&rsquo;s
responsible for the leak, because it went down his channel, you see.


<br><br>


And they do this with documents too.
If you ask Bob and Ryan Wood from Majestic Documents, they&rsquo;ll
tell you that they do this with documents. They deliberately put
spelling mistakes and typos into official documents; and there&rsquo;ll
be different typos and different spelling mistakes in different
documents given to different people, so that when they leak, they
know where it came from. So clever, so simple. You see, they do this
on purpose. They do this on purpose. [Ed note: This process of
differentiating the docs is called &ldquo;salting&rdquo; the docs; it
is a widespread practice in the intelligence community.]

<br><br>


And so there are different levels of
that. There are other reasons for disinforming people, of course, on
the inside, so that they get confused. If someone&rsquo;s confused,
they&rsquo;re easier to control. They do it with us and they do it
with themselves, at junior levels. There are huge numbers of
different levels here. And the guys at the top are trying to control
the people at the bottom, and to keep them running around in
different directions.

<br><br>


One of the things that Bill Deagle
tells, and has been saying ever since his 2006 Granada Forum lecture
that he started to get the big picture sorted out because he was a
doctor working, actually taking care of people physically, in many of
these classified locations. Someone&rsquo;s got to take care of them.
He was the doctor. He was on the inside working there, and he would
talk to somebody who didn&rsquo;t know what was happening in the room
next door to him in this classified establishment. But the guy who
was in the room next door to him had been the previous guy who Deagle
had seen, his previous medical appointment, and had told him his
story.

<br><br>


So Deagle was getting all of these
components from all of these people he was talking to -- because
<I>everyone</I>
talks to their doctor. And so he was able to say to the guy here: <I>Ah,
you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening in the room next door to
you? I just spoke to him yesterday. This is what he said. </I>


<br><br>


And so Deagle was starting to get the
big picture here. And this is just a little anecdote about how
compartmentalized things are.


<br><br>


Long before Camelot, in the year 2000
-- this is a fascinating story which I&rsquo;ve never made public --
long before Camelot; I was on holiday in Thailand. I&rsquo;ve been to
Thailand a number of times; I&rsquo;ve got some friends over there,
and I met a Black Ops guy. Actually there are quite a few of these
guys who hang out there. This is where they go when they&rsquo;re on
the run, or when they&rsquo;re trying to hide, or when they&rsquo;re
trying to pretend the rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t exist.


<br><br>


This guy had worked for Bell Labs.
Fascinating story. I realized that he was an unusual guy because he
was talking to me like an advanced Ph.D.--level physicist. I didn&rsquo;t
know anything about him at all.


<br><br>


But I finally asked him: <I>Well,
where did you go to college? What did you used to do? </I>


<br><br>


And then he said: <I>Come
with me. </I>And we walked
along the beach.


<br><br>


And he said: <I>I
never went to college. </I>


<br><br>


And I found that almost impossible to
believe.


<br><br>


He said: <I>For
my high school science project, I was with a couple of other guys&hellip;</I>
and I wish I could remember exactly what he told me. He made some
kind of a vacuum plasma-powered laser gun, or something. You know,
this was his high school physics project. It&rsquo;s like something
out of these silly Disney movies. He was 17 years old. He was a kid.
He made this thing that was a classified &lsquo;Star Wars&rsquo;
weapon, and he made this incredible device.

<br><br>


The next thing he knew
[knock-knock-knock...Bill raps on table], he got a knock on the door
from the NSA saying: Y<I>ou&rsquo;re
a smart kid, we can take care of you, sign here. We&rsquo;ll give you
lots of money and we&rsquo;ll give you anything you want. We&rsquo;ll
take care of your education. </I>


<br><br>


He&rsquo;s a 17 year old kid. Smart
kid.


<br><br>


He said: <I>Yeah,
sure! </I>


<br><br>


This is what happened to Dan Burisch,
by the way. Same story. Almost.

<br><br>


And so they put him to work in Bell
Labs, and they said to him: <I>We&rsquo;ll
teach you anything you want. You&rsquo;ve got a budget of anything
you want. We want you just to learn stuff, get smart, and invent
stuff. </I>Science kid&rsquo;s
dream.


<br><br>


But what they do with people in Bell
Labs &ndash; this is the point of this story &ndash; he said that
when you&rsquo;re going through to your place of work, they put
special goggles on you which blur everything around you, so that all
you can see is this immediate area around you to make sure that you
don&rsquo;t trip over something or bump into a door and so that you
can see the doorknob when you&rsquo;re opening it.


<br><br>


The rest of the stuff you can&rsquo;t
see, it&rsquo;s a blur. So when you&rsquo;re walking through these
other offices and laboratories, you can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s
going on. You can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s written on the wall, you
can&rsquo;t see who&rsquo;s there, you can&rsquo;t see what they&rsquo;re
doing, but you can make it through to get to the door. And all of
these guys have got these goggles on when they&rsquo;re moving, until
they get to their place and then they take their goggles off. And
then it&rsquo;s like, right [snaps fingers] you&rsquo;re in your
place.

<br><br>


And just as Dan Burisch described in
S-4, there are lines painted on the floor which you can also see, so
you go along these corridors like a tram, and if you wander off, then
all the bells start ringing because you&rsquo;ve got a gadget
attached to your ankle, and the next thing you know, you&rsquo;re
surrounded by security guards because you&rsquo;ve gone off your tram
lines. And if you really go off the tram lines and keep on going off
the tram lines, they&rsquo;re going to shoot you straight away,
because they know that something&rsquo;s badly wrong. That kind of
stuff.


<br><br>


He told us that this is the
environment they&rsquo;re working in, and the reason why he quit,
because he didn&rsquo;t want to work in a place like that. You&rsquo;re
under total intimidation all the time... even though he got to play
with antigravity devices and everything else, you know. After a while
it was no fun. Very, very interesting story.


<br><br>


I actually went back there to try and
find him and I couldn&rsquo;t locate him anymore. He&rsquo;d gone off
somewhere else. He&rsquo;d quit. He&rsquo;s one of these guys who
quit, because a lot of these Black Ops guys quit... they really
suffer. There&rsquo;s another story I never told anybody.

<br><br>


You see, if these things come to you,
if you&rsquo;re doing a job, this information comes at you, and
sometimes it comes really early and you don&rsquo;t know what to do
with it.


<br><br>


I was 18 years old, hitchhiking in
northern Canada... this is in northern British Columbia; it&rsquo;s
my first university vacation. I was 18 years old and I had a 200-mile
ride with a scientist who talked to me, as an anonymous hitchhiker. I
never knew his name, he never knew my name. He talked to me; he
poured his heart out for 200 miles, because he was doing research
about implanting chips in people&rsquo;s brains. This was in 1972....
working for the Canadian military. He was a troubled man; he didn&rsquo;t
know what to do.

<br><br>


I can&rsquo;t remember much of it -- I
was only 18; I was a kid! I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on! I
thought: <I>Wow, this guy is
telling me about all this stuff! Is he crazy or what?</I>
And I listened very hard and all I could remember after 200 miles was
that he was telling me about the experiments he was being made to do,
to put chips into peoples&rsquo; brains to control their behavior

<br><br>


Many years later it&rsquo;s like:
<I>Okay, now I remember&hellip;
okay, now this fits with this, and this fits with this, this fits
with this.</I> But these guys
are troubled, you see. They&rsquo;re really, really troubled.

<br><br>


What Peterson said to us, Pete
Peterson, bless him, he&rsquo;s a good man. They&rsquo;re all good
men, who we&rsquo;ve spoken to... and this is all the context of your
question. Peterson said that he was talking to us because he didn&rsquo;t
like the feeling of &ndash; this is an exact quote: <I>He
didn&rsquo;t like the feeling of having to take three baths a day to
avoid the feeling of being covered in excrement. </I>


<br><br>


Once someone gets a little further on
in their lives... Petersen&rsquo;s over 70 now. He&rsquo;s a lovely
man, and he&rsquo;s done stuff. They&rsquo;ve all done stuff that
they have to live with.

<br><br>


Jake Simpson &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure
this is okay to say this. He&rsquo;s a wonderful man too; he&rsquo;s
a really good friend of ours. They do all of this psychological
profiling, and they pass tests and, you know, they get to go on
certain missions and so on and so forth. He said that there was a
particular test that he failed which then confined his military
intelligence history at one point. The test that he failed... it was
a psychological profiling test, it wasn&rsquo;t an actual test, but
they determined that he would be unable to kill a child.

<br><br>


FC:  Oh, my goodness.

<br><br>


BR:  And therefore there were certain
missions that he didn&rsquo;t go on, you know. There&rsquo;re certain
things that he wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; I mean, bless him because he
couldn&rsquo;t kill a child, but it means that in this whole world
that we&rsquo;re inhabiting of espionage, military counter&hellip; in
this whole thing, these people who often get&hellip; they&rsquo;re
good people and they go into these programs. They don&rsquo;t know;
they&rsquo;re not told everything at the beginning. They don&rsquo;t
know what they&rsquo;re being called upon to do.


<br><br>


&lsquo;Henry Deacon&rsquo; (Arthur
Neumann) told us&hellip; You see, there&rsquo;s stuff there that he
hasn&rsquo;t told. There&rsquo;s stuff there that he can&rsquo;t talk
about, because he can&rsquo;t bring himself to talk about it, and we
don&rsquo;t know what it is because he&rsquo;s never told us!

<br><br>


There are Mars veterans just like
there are Vietnam veterans. Not because there&rsquo;s a fight, just
because people&hellip; they do a tour of duty on Mars. They spend
some time working on a project, and they go to Mars and come back,
and go to Mars and come back, and all of this kind of stuff. And then
they get moved on to another project, maybe. It&rsquo;s my term I&rsquo;m
using: &ldquo;a Mars veteran&rdquo;.

<br><br>


He said that later on, after he did
all this stuff with Mars, he was working with a guy in a small
classified project within NOAA; the National Oceanic and Atmospherics
Administration. It&rsquo;s like NASA, but it&rsquo;s NOAA. It&rsquo;s
a public body, but they have classified projects too. That&rsquo;s
when he told us that he knew about &ldquo;the second sun&rdquo; that
was coming in. He encountered that in NOAA. They&rsquo;re just
tracking it. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a big problem or not,
but it&rsquo;s out there somewhere, he said. He didn&rsquo;t really
know much about it. He said they talked about it sometimes.


<br><br>


And there was this other guy who
worked there who, by coincidence, happened to be a Mars veteran. He&rsquo;d
also done his stuff on Mars. And &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; (Arthur) said
these two men would go into their office, they would lock the door,
and they would <I>weep</I>
together. He never told us why. He couldn&rsquo;t say. I don&rsquo;t
know why! I don&rsquo;t know why! Kerry and I have been guessing for
two years. We have no idea! We have no idea.


<br><br>


And it might not matter, and we never
pressed &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; on that. There are places which he, you
know, you ask him questions and they&rsquo;d bounce off. He changes
the subject, or doesn&rsquo;t want to respond. But anyone who&rsquo;s
been in these programs, they have suffered. They&rsquo;re suffering
people.

<br><br>


Another story that &lsquo;Henry&rsquo;
told us, he was involved in the 9/11 operation that morning. We
publicized that. But it&rsquo;s just a good... it&rsquo;s just an
interesting story to tell, because as an electronics specialist, one
of the jobs that he had was to set up the control system which
resulted in those two planes being flown into the Twin Towers &ndash;
control of that model aircraft from thousands of miles away. He set
up the electronics for that. He told us all about it.


<br><br>


But, as most people do in these
projects, he didn&rsquo;t know what he was working on. He was just
working on a control system. He didn&rsquo;t know what it was going
to be used for. They didn&rsquo;t tell him. Why should they? &ldquo;Need
to know.&rdquo;


<br><br>


But on the morning before all of that
happened on the 11th of September, he and the people in his place of
work were given a briefing. And the essence of the briefing was: <I>On
television today you will see a whole bunch of stuff that&rsquo;s
going to be very dramatic, but don&rsquo;t worry about it because
it&rsquo;s just one of our projects.</I>

<br><br>


And he said one of the things that
shocked him &ndash; and it&rsquo;s a little bit like that other story
he told about this briefing that he went into &ndash; he said the
thing that amazed him was that everyone else said: <I>Okay,</I>
and just went back to work.


<br><br>


And he was thinking: <I>Oh,
my God, what are we working on? It&rsquo;s going to result in the
deaths of thousands of people and the destruction of these two
buildings, and God knows what!</I>



<br><br>


And then he had a few hours in which
he realized that he had the capability to sabotage it. Because he was
working with the control system, he could easily put something in the
software that would make those planes miss &ndash; and he didn&rsquo;t
do it. And he lives with that. He lives with the fact that he could
have averted 9/11. He could have had those planes drive into the
Hudson, and they didn&rsquo;t do it. And he has to live with that.

<br><br>


You and I, and everyone else watching
this, they cannot imagine what it&rsquo;s like being somebody who is
carrying that in their soul. And that&rsquo;s why they talk, you see.
That&rsquo;s why they talk. They talk because they are trying to
purge their souls. They&rsquo;re trying to atone for what they feel
they&rsquo;ve done. And on the inside there&rsquo;s no escape.


<br><br>


This is why we&rsquo;re protected.
This is why you may be protected as well, or may come to be protected
as you come and do more and more work, because some of these guys,
there&rsquo;s nothing they can say on the inside. They can&rsquo;t
speak out. They can&rsquo;t go and ring up their local newspaper and
spill their story, or call you or call me. They can&rsquo;t do this
stuff, because if they move, then that&rsquo;s the end of them. Or
the end of their children. Or the end of something. It&rsquo;s not
smart for them to do that.


<br><br>


So what they do, very quietly, is they
will do something very, very indirectly that supports you and me
continuing to do the story. They&rsquo;re rooting for us, you see,
they&rsquo;re rooting for us. There are a lot of people that are
rooting for us. We know that. And we&rsquo;ve been told that by a
number of people -- the &ldquo;White Hats&rdquo; on the inside.
They&rsquo;re doing everything that they can do to help you and me,
and a lot of other people out there, do our work.


<br><br>


Now, then you get the whole chess game
being played, because knowing that this is happening, then of course
this disinformation will come trickling down.


<br><br>


So I use this just as an example
because it comes to mind. After we met with Peterson for many, many
hours, and he told us a whole bunch of unbelievable things, some of
which weren&rsquo;t on the video, after that we&rsquo;ve had a number
of phone conversations with him. And then in some of those phone
conversations &ndash; I won&rsquo;t go into any detail here at all &ndash;
in some of those phone conversations, he said: <I>I&rsquo;ve
just heard this from one of my mates. I&rsquo;ve just heard this from
one of my friends on the inside.</I>



<br><br>


Now, we don&rsquo;t know whether to
believe that or not, not because <I>he</I>
is necessarily providing us with any disinformation, but because then
he becomes a problem to them. But at the same time, they&rsquo;re
trying to&hellip; I mean, one has to think in a military way. You
have to think like a spook. You have to think like you&rsquo;re on
the other side of the chess board trying to figure out what to do.

<br><br>


They know that he&rsquo;s still in
contact with us. They&rsquo;re not going to shoot him in the head,
because then that confirms everything he&rsquo;s ever told us, so
that&rsquo;s the last thing they do. But what they do is they see if
they can twist it round. And then they twist it round by offering him
a little bit of a tidbit of information, hoping that he&rsquo;ll
believe it, and hoping that he&rsquo;ll tell us, and hoping that
we&rsquo;ll believe it, and hoping that then we say it.


<br><br>


So then we have to use some kind of a
filter. And some people, going back to the Clay and Shawn Pickering
story, some people in the UFO community have not touched that because
they feel they can&rsquo;t correlate this information about the
silicon-based life form to anything else that they&rsquo;ve ever
heard. They&rsquo;re worried that this might be a very complex, very
subtle, very clever disinformation ploy to get people fighting in the
UFO community.


<br><br>


It happens all the time, and they&rsquo;ll
use credible people. They&rsquo;ll use people who believe the story,
because a source who believes what he&rsquo;s saying is going to be
much more valuable than somebody who&rsquo;s been ordered to lie, you
see.


<br><br>


Somebody who believes what he&rsquo;s
saying is going to be really credible, and they&rsquo;re going to
say: <I>Well, I really believe
this information, and I&rsquo;ve got these documents, and I spoke
with this person, and I also heard this from another person, and this
is what I really think is happening. And everything they say is true.
</I>


<br><br>


And they&rsquo;re absolutely credible.
They look you in the eye. You can feel they&rsquo;re good people, you
can feel they&rsquo;re being honest, and you still don&rsquo;t know
whether the information is true. This is the problem. Because we
don&rsquo;t know the provenance.


<br><br>


And so what we do, I mean, all we can
do, if somebody tells us something, we say: <I>Right.
How do you know this? Who told you? How sure are you? Is it single
source? Did you hear this from two different people? How long ago did
you hear it? What happened just before you were told that?</I>

<br><br>


We&rsquo;re trying to get the lie of
the land, and what I try and do personally, if I can, is when I&rsquo;m
writing a report I always say, I always put little <I>caveats</I>
in this, and I&rsquo;m always wanting like to take every opportunity
to clarify &ndash; both Kerry and I do this: <I>That
this is what we were told. The person who told us, we believe that he
believed it. Maybe it&rsquo;s not true. </I>


<br><br>


And this loops right back to this
thing about the 27th of November. There are all kinds of <I>caveats</I>
there, see. But the problem is &ndash; and this is the problem that
we have in this job that we&rsquo;re doing &ndash; because even
though we put the <I>caveats</I>
there, and Peterson put the <I>caveats</I>
there, and we&rsquo;re thinking: <I>Well,
you know, I don&rsquo;t know about this, but this is what he said,
and it would be cool if it were true&hellip; </I>Then
it gets copied and copied, and it gets emailed, and it gets on
someone else&rsquo;s blog, and then someone else states it on a radio
show, and so on and so forth, and the next thing you know it&rsquo;s
like: <I>This is what Project
Camelot is saying</I>, and then
on the 28th of November, we&rsquo;ll be liars.


<br><br>


And we&rsquo;re not. We&rsquo;re just
being reporters. But we&rsquo;re trying to be reporters with as much
responsibility as we can. We&rsquo;re not Fox News, that says: <I>We
report, you decide. </I>You
know, we&rsquo;re not&hellip; We&rsquo;re not removing ourselves from
any responsibility here. But at the same time, we&rsquo;re trying to
put together what we feel is credible information. We can kind of see
patterns. We&rsquo;re trying to say to people: <I>We
think we see this pattern, but maybe you see a different pattern. But
let&rsquo;s check it all out.</I>

<br><br>


We&rsquo;re learning all the time. We
know that some of our information is not correct, because it can&rsquo;t
be, because we get people contradicting each other. We do feel that
between 80 and 90 percent of our information is accurate. I used to
say 95 percent; I think it&rsquo;s probably between 80 and 90. That&rsquo;s
quite a heavy load of good information.


<br><br>


We&rsquo;re on the lookout for people
who feed us crazy stuff. People send us crazy stuff by e-mail all the
time. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s easy for a kid to write a crazy
story and say: <I>Hey, I&rsquo;m
a whistleblower. </I>


<br><br>


Sometimes you can kind of tell
immediately. You know, when somebody says they&rsquo;re a Ph.D.
scientist and they can&rsquo;t even spell, you know, then it&rsquo;s
like: <I>Okay, there&rsquo;s
something wrong here</I>.


<br><br>


And at the same time, sometimes you
pick up one of these little threads, and we do use our intuition, for
what it&rsquo;s worth. Kerry and I both use our intuition. When we&rsquo;re
both thinking: <I>There&rsquo;s
something important here, there&rsquo;s something important here</I>,
then we tend to follow it. And then we&rsquo;ll invest some of our
time in checking it out.

<br><br>


It&rsquo;s very important not to
frontload people, meaning, if somebody says &ndash; this is an
invented story, an invented example. If somebody wrote to us and
says: <I>I was at a Mars
base</I>... Anyone can say
that.


<br><br>


Then rather than saying: <I>Oh,
this is what &lsquo;Henry Deacon&rsquo; told us. Is this true?</I>
You see. Then the kid in the basement playing the joke says: <I>Yes,
it is</I>. You see. That&rsquo;s
not a very good question to ask. You&rsquo;ve got to ask open
questions. You&rsquo;ve got to say: <I>What&rsquo;s
it like? What did you see? </I>You
don&rsquo;t ask them any questions to confirm anything at all,
because then all they&rsquo;re going to do is say yes. And so on and
so forth.


<br><br>


Sometimes we come across information
that we just don&rsquo;t buy at all, and there are some people in the
research community that we just don&rsquo;t... we just don&rsquo;t
buy their information; there&rsquo;s something wrong with it.

<br><br>


Now, we may be wrong in some of that
information. We may have bought some information that doesn&rsquo;t
fit. We&rsquo;ve got a lot of information about Dan Burisch, for
example. People say: <I>He&rsquo;s
a liar, he&rsquo;s crazy,</I>
you know, <I>he&rsquo;s this,
he&rsquo;s that.</I>


<br><br>


He&rsquo;s not a liar and he&rsquo;s
not crazy. His information isn&rsquo;t all correct, I&rsquo;m certain
about that.


<br><br>


But he&rsquo;s a good-hearted guy.
He&rsquo;s heavily controlled. He&rsquo;s now been turned against us,
and that&rsquo;s because we trod on someone&rsquo;s toes after the
Zurich conference. We don&rsquo;t know what we did to tread on those
toes, but Dan Burisch is now corralled by a bunch of people who
regard us as some kind of an enemy. And we are not an enemy. We will
continue to present his information with as much intellectual honesty
as we can do.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s a tough battlefield. You
win friends, you lose friends; you become disconnected from people.
But we do think that we know who&rsquo;s good-hearted and who&rsquo;s
not good-hearted. We think we can kind of tell that, probably as you
can.


<br><br>


And one of the things we were told...
and this makes our lives more difficult, but this is one of the
things that also keeps us alive. We were told by a very friendly
insider source, he said: <I>Listen,
</I>he said, <I>don&rsquo;t
try and prove anything. Never try and prove anything. </I>


<br><br>


And actually at that time it just
didn&rsquo;t seem&hellip; because we weren&rsquo;t trying to prove
anything anyway. We don&rsquo;t have any documents. We don&rsquo;t
have an alien in the cupboard that we can wheel out in front of the
camera, saying: <I>Here look at
this.</I> We don&rsquo;t have
anything like that. We don&rsquo;t have convincing photographs. We
don&rsquo;t have affidavits from anybody. We don&rsquo;t have
anything.


<br><br>


All we have is stories, and we&rsquo;re
trying to paint a picture. We&rsquo;re trying to put this mosaic
together so people can see for themselves, so that people can use
this to correlate their own experience.


<br><br>


But there&rsquo;s a very subtle point
here because some people say: <I>You
can&rsquo;t prove anything you&rsquo;re saying! You&rsquo;re coming
up with all this stuff and there&rsquo;s not one document, not one
photograph, not one affidavit, nothing. You can&rsquo;t prove a
thing!</I>

<br><br>


And besides the fact that we don&rsquo;t
<I>have</I>
that stuff, we&rsquo;re not withholding it or anything, but this is
the fuse in the circuit that enables us to continue to work.


<br><br>


Actually, it was Hal Puthoff, Dr. Hal
Puthoff, the very famous physicist, and the guy who ran the remote
viewing program at SRI &ndash; I regard him as a friend, I met him
for a couple of days, a wonderful man. And he was the first person
who said, he said: <I>Look,
it&rsquo;s very important, it&rsquo;s important for the authorities
to maintain plausible deniability. </I>


<br><br>


He said they <I>want</I>
this information to come out, but it&rsquo;s got a built-in
shock-absorber in the system; that they <I>want</I>
all these stories about ETs and these stories about abductions and
these stories about military hardware and these stories about what&rsquo;s&hellip;
they <I>want</I>
this stuff to be slowly percolating into the popular culture, but
without any proof at all.

<br><br>


Because this means that the people
whose reality would be threatened, seriously, if there was a
photograph of an alien, or a conclusive document with Kennedy&rsquo;s
signature, saying: <I>I was
going to do this,</I> signed,
date, the day before he was killed or something, then you get people
reacting to this in shock, jumping out of windows, civil unrest,
effect on the economy, blah, blah, blah, destabilizing governments,
because suddenly, you&rsquo;ve got this stuff in people&rsquo;s face,
and they know&hellip; And you get... and the religious question, for
God&rsquo;s sake, as it were.


<br><br>


So the plausible deniability is in
there all the time because no one is being forced to take anything
onboard if they can&rsquo;t handle it. If they can&rsquo;t handle it,
they just say: <I>This person&rsquo;s
crazy. Bill Ryan&rsquo;s crazy. Mel&rsquo;s crazy</I>
[Melani from FC]<I>. Alex Jones
is crazy. David Icke&rsquo;s crazy.</I>
That&rsquo;s their shock-absorber, and then they go and live their
lives and the world continues in a stable say.

<br><br>


But the people who can take it on
board do, and they say: <I>You
know what? I feel this is true. I don&rsquo;t need any proof; I&rsquo;m
just going to think about this now, and it fits with what I heard
from this other guy.</I>

<br><br>


And this is why it&rsquo;s important,
and workable, and it&rsquo;s all working on a drip feed. We&rsquo;re
actually not only protected by the &ldquo;White Hats&rdquo;, but
we&rsquo;re useful to the &ldquo;Black Hats&rdquo;, because they&rsquo;ve
got a problem.


<br><br>


They&rsquo;ve got a problem because
they&rsquo;re sitting on all this stuff. It&rsquo;s got to come out,
somehow. They&rsquo;ve had a program in place for decades now where
they&rsquo;re seeding this information to the popular culture, as
early as 1952 or whenever it was, when they made the first version of
<I>The Day the Earth Stood
Still. </I>


<br><br>


They were trying to tell the world
then something about what&rsquo;s really going on. Ever since then,
we&rsquo;ve had&hellip; I mean, it&rsquo;s like any kid, any teenager
who watches movies, you ask them if ETs are real, and they&rsquo;ll
look at you like you&rsquo;re crazy. Of course they&rsquo;re real!
It&rsquo;s obvious! They&rsquo;ve been watching cartoons about it
ever since they were four years old; for them it&rsquo;s part of
their reality. They think people who think that it can&rsquo;t be
real are crazy, you see. So it&rsquo;s working, and this is in the
popular culture. They&rsquo;ve been seeding all this stuff in there.


<br><br>


We&rsquo;re very, very useful to them.
We&rsquo;re useful to them because we&rsquo;re helping this process.
We were never part of the plan, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean to say
that they&rsquo;re not opportunistically pleased that we suddenly
appeared on the scene. We haven&rsquo;t been manipulated into doing
this.


<br><br>


But it&rsquo;s part of how this all
goes together. If this does solve their problem so that the world is
able to take upon Disclosure, and we&rsquo;re somehow part of their
strategy because somebody really does want to make an announcement
that tells the truth, I&rsquo;m actually pleased to be part of that.
We&rsquo;re not knowingly being used, but if it&rsquo;s the truth,
it&rsquo;s the truth, and so let&rsquo;s do that.


<br><br>


And in the meantime, of course,
they&rsquo;re reading our emails. They&rsquo;re probably listening to
this conversation, they&rsquo;re going to watch this video and
they&rsquo;re going to analyze what I know. They&rsquo;re going to
figure out what it is that I&rsquo;m saying, what it is that I&rsquo;m
not saying, someone&rsquo;s going to do an assessment to see whether
I&rsquo;m being responsible. They&rsquo;re continuing to update my
profile, they&rsquo;re going to find out whether I&rsquo;m reliable,
they&rsquo;re going to see what else they&rsquo;re going to throw at
me, that I might&hellip; or us. You know, when I say &ldquo;me&rdquo;,
I&rsquo;m only talking about me because Kerry&rsquo;s not here.

<br><br>


They do this with us all the time. And
to the degree that we&rsquo;re useful to them, we&rsquo;re going to
be allowed to continue. I think we&rsquo;re doing them a big favor.


<br><br>


They&rsquo;re interested to know who
we&rsquo;re talking to; they read all our e-mails; they figure out
who is waking up. But you can&rsquo;t avoid that. You can&rsquo;t
avoid that. The only way to avoid that completely is to go into a
hole, stop communicating, and go and do something else all your life.
And that&rsquo;s not the plan either, you see. We have to work with
them.


<br><br>


So it&rsquo;s a kind of symbiosis, you
see. It&rsquo;s a symbiosis. It&rsquo;s a sort of ecosystem, where
all of these, you know, where you&rsquo;ve got the sharks and the
mice and the elephants and the lions and the tigers and the snakes --
they all live together in this ecosystem. And that&rsquo;s kind of
what&rsquo;s happening on planet Earth at the moment. Now, this is a
real metaphor, but that ecosystem is kind of evolving in a particular
direction.


<br><br>


In the meantime, everything&rsquo;s
kind of finding its own level: the energy&rsquo;s flowing, the
information is flowing, and you get this whole thing played out on
this huge, cosmic tapestry which has got something to do with
consciousness increasing. The consciousness needs to have information
so that it&rsquo;s got something to process, so people can de-confuse
themselves.


<br><br>


The kids who are coming into this
world think: <I>What the hell&rsquo;s
going on? Ah, now I know why I&rsquo;m here. Now I know what the game
is. Now I know where these chess pieces are. Now I know what to trust
and what not to trust. </I>


<br><br>


And everyone&rsquo;s figuring this
out, and that&rsquo;s all part of the learning because that&rsquo;s
all part of their responsibility, individual responsibility, to
utilize this training course and to learn what they can learn.


<br><br>


And all of this is against the
backdrop of a whole bunch of nasty people who may or may not have
lost their planet an awful long time ago, who are trying to control
us because they&rsquo;re frightened of the power that we have as
infinite consciousness. And as they say, the guy who said this at the
beginning of the third <I>Bourne</I>
movie: <I>You couldn&rsquo;t
make this stuff up!</I> It&rsquo;s
wonderful! What a...


<br><br>


And it&rsquo;s like David Icke says: <I>I
wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere else doing anything else at any other
time. </I>It&rsquo;s a
fantastic time to be alive. And it&rsquo;s just the place to be. This
is where the action is. We&rsquo;re on the cutting edge.


<br><br>


And for anyone watching this that is
wondering whether this is the right place to be, I defy you to think
of anything else, anywhere else that wasn&rsquo;t quite so much fun
as right now. And the opportunity is to really make a difference.


<br><br>


FC:  Lovely. All right. On that note,
Bill, thank you very much for your time, and it was absolutely the
greatest pleasure to speak to you and get to pick your brains of all
the wonderful information you have. I really hope we can sit down and
have another chat sometime soon because I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;ve
got a lot more to tell. So, I thank you for your time.

<br><br>


BR:  It&rsquo;s been a very great
pleasure.


<br><br>


FC:  Thank you.
