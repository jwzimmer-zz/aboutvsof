BILL
RYAN (BR):  Are we live?
<br><br>

TRANSLATOR:
 Yeah.
<br><br>

BR:
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, colleague, and fellow retired
mountaineer, Brian O&rsquo;Leary.
<br><br>

BRIAN
O&rsquo;LEARY (BO&rsquo;L):  Well, thank you. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t
even know what to say. I&rsquo;m just overwhelmed with good feelings
about all of you. Even those of you that are sometimes angry...

<br><br>

[laughter
and applause] &hellip;because, as you know, anger is a very important
part of the process of transformation.

<br><br>

Some
of you may know about the work of Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross -- about
the phases of grief -- because, you see, we are grieving an old
paradigm. We all know that we&rsquo;re messing up the planet and we
need all the help we can get, whether it&rsquo;s through our ET
visitors, or ourselves.

<br><br>

Elisabeth
K&uuml;bler-Ross did the very important work that we must go through,
the experiences of the emotions of grief.

<br><br>

The
first stage is almost always denial, and most of humanity is in
denial. Our beautiful, precious planet and all of nature is in danger
and it&rsquo;s with that kind of motivation that I approach what I
will be sharing today.
<br><br>

The
second phase, and it&rsquo;s not necessarily a linear progression, is
anger. We heard that last night, and that&rsquo;s perfectly okay.
That&rsquo;s much better than murdering and torturing people. It&rsquo;s
a healthy expression that we know that something is wrong, or at
least there&rsquo;s something that is happening, something that is
changing. It&rsquo;s not necessarily <I>wrong,
</I>but we are in the midst
of a big change.
<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
with great mixed feelings that I come from America. When I was a
little boy and I was told by my parents that we won World War Two --
that was a good feeling. I didn&rsquo;t, of course, know all the
details, but I was raised with a feeling that we could do anything.
<br><br>

Now,
when I was eight years old, I wanted to go to the Moon. I would read
the writings of Wernher von Braun and Arthur C. Clarke, and everybody
thought I was crazy. When I was a senior in high school, I was asked
to write an essay on an important topic. I wrote it on space
satellites. The history teacher handed the paper back to me and said:
<I>Well-researched, but not
relevant. </I>[laughter]
<br><br>

The
following fall, Sputnik went up and twelve short years later, man
<I>allegedly</I>
landed on the Moon. [laughter]

<br><br>

I
use the word <I>allegedly,</I>
because I don&rsquo;t know, personally, whether the Moon landings
were a hoax or real. How am I to tell, if I didn&rsquo;t go there?
And then, this raises the nagging question of epistemology: How do we
know what we know?
<br><br>

Well,
when I was in school I became an Eagle Scout. I climbed the
Matterhorn in 1962, and I was appointed as an astronaut to go to
Mars, in 1967. So, you could see, I was raised with the point of view
that we could do anything.
<br><br>

But,
a few things happened on the way to the vision. One was the war in
Vietnam. That was in 1968, when I was told by the president of the
United States then, Lyndon B. Johnson, that we would scrub the later
Apollo flights and the Mars mission.

<br><br>

Needless
to say, I was very disappointed. So, I went to Cornell University to
teach astronomy alongside Carl Sagan. And I became a peace activist,
and I have been ever since.
<br><br>

It
was interesting last night that there was this feeling of anger that
continued when we went to the Chinese restaurant to have roast duck,
and a very angry man came up to our table and said: <I>You
Americans! </I><I>Oh, Obama
is bad </I><I>schlesht</I>.
[laughs] [Ed note: We don&rsquo;t know if this word is a made-up word
or an actual foreign word.]
<br><br>

So,
you see, the tradition of anger continued, and the last thing I want
to do is support any kind of effort towards war and torture.

<br><br>

So,
what I thought I&rsquo;d do, to center myself and all of us, I&rsquo;m
going to play the piano for about five minutes. [applause] It helps
center me. And, then we&rsquo;ll kind of invoke positive energy here,
so that we can go on with the talk. Thank you. [applause]

<br><br>

[Brian
plays piano for several minutes.]<B>
</B>

<br><br>

[applause]


<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Thank you. It was interesting that Bill introduced me last night as
being the <I>oldest</I>
person on the panel and I sometimes wonder what happened to all those
years! All I know is that I&rsquo;m acting as if this last trip is
our last, and there&rsquo;s a big job to do, if it is.

<br><br>

But,
I don&rsquo;t think it is [laughs] because the world situation...
let&rsquo;s face it -- it&rsquo;s very, very difficult. It&rsquo;s
easy to get angry. It&rsquo;s easy to place blame on those that are
suppressing things. And I, being a peace activist &ndash; and peace
activists act in different ways &ndash; I visualize a big field of
love enveloping everything, and that&rsquo;s where the negativity
dissolves.
<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
a piece of the whole transformational picture, which I&rsquo;ve taken
it upon myself to have a good look at. That is: <I>What
should we do about the energy crisis?</I>


<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
sure most of you are aware of how deep the environmental problems of
the Earth are. In 1975 I was an advisor &ndash; energy advisor &ndash;
to the U.S. Congress, and I worked with Congressman Morris Udall, who
was running for president on an environmental platform. In the
effort, I was able to learn about what many of the options were for
our energy future.
<br><br>

But,
at that time, I was very much in the mainstream, so the notion of
free energy, or zero-point energy, or various advanced hydrogen and
water chemistries, and cold fusion, didn&rsquo;t occur to me. So I
became a solar/wind advocate, and it&rsquo;s still something that
could, conceivably, solve our problems.

<br><br>

But,
all of this was part of a track that I was taking in my life, was to
envision what realistically we could do, as humans, to create a
sustainable future for humankind.

<br><br>

In
the process, I also went through a period of intense metaphysical
exploration. That began to happen in 1979 when I was on the physics
faculty at Princeton University. I started to have remote viewing
experiences. I had a near-death experience, and I had various healing
experiences.
<br><br>

At
that point, I began to realize that science, Western science, was
very limited. And, because the other physicists at Princeton, my
colleagues, six of whom were Nobel <I>Laureates</I>
&ndash; there were 40 of us and we were all men &ndash; didn&rsquo;t
believe anything in the paranormal was real.

<br><br>

So,
I felt very lonely and felt compelled to leave Princeton, and it was
at that time my career became endangered. [laughs] At this point,
having now been in this <I>outside-the-box</I>
mode for 30 years, I&rsquo;m feeling more comfortable with it.
<br><br>

Now,
it was hard, financially, for me to get my children through college,
but I really have enjoyed these 30 years. Because, not only was I
able to explore many metaphysical concepts and have spiritual growth
as well, but I was able to check in with new scientists and observe
their experiments, all over the world, about the realities of
paranormal phenomena.
<br><br>

So,
if it&rsquo;s the healing, or whether it&rsquo;s remote viewing, or
morphogenetic fields, or UFO/ET phenomena, the power of positive
intention, the power of meditators being able to change the
properties of water, or free energy... every time I began to discover
for myself the value, the importance, of these new sciences.

<br><br>

And,
the really good news about this is that the epistemology of this new
science is exactly the same as that of mainstream science. So, you
can have it all ways.
<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;d like to do today is focus on one aspect of new science, and
that&rsquo;s the promise of clean, cheap, decentralized energy. So,
now I&rsquo;m going to sit down and take you on a little slideshow:
<I>The Energy Solution
Revolution</I>, which is also
the title of my latest book.
<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;m looking at now, because I think this is where the real
answers lie. Having visited the laboratories of several dozen
so-called <I>free energy
inventors</I>, I have
absolutely no doubt the technologies are very real.

<br><br>

The
concepts have already been proven. The Wright Brothers have already
flown their first airplane, but we haven&rsquo;t put it to practical
use yet.
<br><br>

So,
the real action in this issue is not technical... it&rsquo;s social
and political.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
very clear that these concepts have great promise for a sustainable
future for the Earth, but the technologies have been suppressed,
especially when they get to the point of being available to the
public. And I began to learn how difficult it really is to get to the
point of implementing technologies such as this, because it threatens
vested interests.
<br><br>

So,
very appropriately here, and I think, maybe, if we turn the lights
down a little&hellip;

<br><br>

I
love this quote from George Orwell, the author of <I>1984:
In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a
revolutionary act. </I>And we
are certainly in one of those times.

<br><br>

The
great, late science fiction writer Isaac Asimov said: <I>When
stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent. </I>

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
going to talk a little bit about an example of the great threat to
our precious planet Earth.

<br><br>

Meredith
and I live in Ecuador. We live in a beautiful spot that is in the
Andes, which reminds me very much of the Alps... without the snow.

<br><br>

Just
to the east of us is the Amazon Basin. It&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s
largest intact rainforest, consisting of an area [the size] of most
of Western Europe, and there are many indigenous peoples who are
voluntarily isolated. It&rsquo;s the rainforest with the greatest
biodiversity on Earth and absorbs more carbon dioxide than just about
any other area of the Earth.

<br><br>

What
you see here on this map, on the upper left side, is the country of
Ecuador. It&rsquo;s this area right here. [indicating map]

<br><br>

So,
this is Ecuador, and we live right here, and the Amazon is all in
here. This is Peru here, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia; and the yellow
areas are all areas in which oil-drilling leases have been issued.

<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
about a trillion Swiss Francs-worth of oil under the ground in these
areas, and the governments, generally, would like the oil companies
to come in and drill, because of their huge indebtedness to banking
institutions in the First World.

<br><br>

So,
about one month ago, the indigenous peoples of Peru occupied a bridge
to prevent the oil companies from coming into the rainforest. The
president of Peru ordered helicopters with machine guns to murder
them.

<br><br>

This
is an example of the kinds of things that are happening right now.
This is the kind of news that&rsquo;s hard to get on CNN. You have a
little better opportunity here.
<br><br>

But
this is an example of just the kind of thing...

<br><br>

You
know, I often reflect about the <I>green
movement</I>, and the green
movement is moving too slowly. So, this is a quote from a writer from
San Francisco, the <I>San
Francisco Chronicle</I>.

<br><br>

This
is Mark Morford and he says: <I>Much
as I love the green movement, in the face of countless billions to be
made by raping the planet for oil, they&rsquo;re merely the
equivalent of trying to water the rainforest with an eye-dropper.</I>
<br><br>

In
other words, the green movement has not been very effective. If we
really want a sustainable solution for the Earth, we&rsquo;re going
to have to have clean energy.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
not going to be able to do it with carbon cap and trading
&ndash; <I>carbon cap and
trading</I>: that&rsquo;s a
scheme to, basically, charge the polluters more money to&hellip; it&rsquo;s
a financial solution to a non-financial problem &ndash; or to
sequester the carbon in caves. These are very gross solutions.

<br><br>

Now,
the president of Ecuador, who&rsquo;s an interesting guy, has
proposed that, maybe, Ecuador could keep its oil in the ground in its
most beautiful, biodiverse, rainforest national park, if the world
community could match funds with lost revenues with Ecuador.
Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s 350 million dollars, or Francs.

<br><br>

Three-hundred-and-fifty-million
dollars per year to keep the oil in the ground; those are the
revenues that would be lost.

<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER:  Millions, or billions?
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Millions. That&rsquo;s still a lot. Does anybody have $350 million,
maybe, to keep oil in the ground in the Amazon? [laughter] Because&hellip;


<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBERS:  [very faint; offering suggestions of who may have the
money]

<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 The Federal Reserve, yeah; AIG; maybe Goldman Sachs, the Lapis Pig.
Anyway, this is an innovative idea. It&rsquo;s a step in the right
direction.

<br><br>

But,
solutions to the energy crisis do exist, but are suppressed by
governments and industry through the profit motive [snorts like the
Lapis Pig], self interest, and &ndash; this is a big word &ndash;
incrementalism, meaning a little bit at a time, eye-dropper.
<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
very clear that, if you were to really look at the data on what&rsquo;s
happening &ndash; regardless
of how you come out on the global warming / climate change debate
&ndash; because, even if it&rsquo;s
a whole reenergized, new energy solar system concept, the loading of
carbon dioxide in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, through the routine
burning of hydrocarbons, is acidifying the oceans and causing
enormous amounts of pollution, respiratory disease, and at least some
contribution to global warming and climate change.

<br><br>

But,
that&rsquo;s just part of it. The amount of water pollution is
enormous. The threats to sustainable agriculture are huge. So, we
need new human systems that are Earth-oriented and visionary.

<br><br>

As
I pointed out the other night, we need to adopt the <I>precautionary
principle</I> which states,
basically, that we can&rsquo;t go on as we&rsquo;re going on. We will
someday reach a tipping point that no amount of chemtrails, or other
gross macro-engineering projects, will be able to solve.

<br><br>

So,
let&rsquo;s create a much-more sustainable, friendly world for
ourselves.

<br><br>

What
kind of criteria would we develop for our energy sources? They need
to be clean, cheap, decentralized, and safe, as well as publicly
accountable.

<br><br>

This
is a very, very tall order. No weapons use, no secrecy, no greed. You
see, we need a whole new social contract, and it&rsquo;s going to be
up to us to create that.

<br><br>

Now,
most of the energy we now use is unsustainable. It&rsquo;s very
obvious that we&rsquo;re going to wars of conquest for the oil... and
the pollution, and climate change, etcetera, etcetera.

<br><br>

Among
the net energy non-solutions, of course, are hydrocarbons or fossil
fuels &ndash; oil,
coal and natural gas. Terrible! Terrible! Nuclear power is expensive
and unsafe. Remember Chernobyl? And there&rsquo;s no safe disposal of
the high-level radioactive waste. There&rsquo;s the potential of
global proliferation of the technologies and weapons.
<br><br>

So,
some people say: <I>Well,
let&rsquo;s have a hydrogen economy. Hydrogen burns clean.</I>
But hydrogen costs more to&hellip; it takes more energy to produce
the hydrogen than you get out of the fuel, unless you do things to
the hydrogen to manipulate its chemical nature.

<br><br>

And,
then, we have a form of over-unity, or free energy.
<br><br>

Biofuels;
biofuels, such as corn -- ethanol from corn -- don&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s
another way of burning carbon. It burns a little bit cleaner, but you
need a whole, big infrastructure to develop it. So that&rsquo;s not
gonna work, and it competes with agriculture!

<br><br>

One
sports-utility vehicle&rsquo;s tank-full of biofuel... one tank-full
of the sports-utility vehicle of biofuel could feed one hungry person
in one year. Yet, in North America and parts of Europe, there&rsquo;s
a huge amount of corn being grown for ethanol. And that&rsquo;s
burning <I>food</I>!
<br><br>

Solar
and wind suffer from high cost. We&rsquo;re talking somewhere in the
vicinity of $20 to $40 trillion dollars for a solar or wind economy
to replace current energy demand. It takes great materials and land
use, and is intermittent and diffuse
&ndash; meaning that it only
works when the wind blows and the sun shines, and it&rsquo;s not very
concentrated.
<br><br>

I
would love for solar and wind to be the answer, but I think we&rsquo;re
in a new century now and we need to look forward rather than
backward.

<br><br>

So,
the new energy technologies include the so-called <I>zero-point</I>
energy devices. Yes, these are basically electromagnetic devices
that, through the use of vibrating electrons
&ndash; either through the
rotary motion of a wheel with magnets or electromagnets, or through
the vibrations of electrons within a solid-state device
&ndash; can tap the enormous
potential energy field of the vacuum.

<br><br>

This
field is called many different things; sometimes it&rsquo;s called
the <I>etheric</I>
field; sometimes the <I>zero-point</I>
field; sometimes it&rsquo;s called the <I>orgone</I>
energy field.

<br><br>

There
are many, many different words for it, and I believe it&rsquo;s the
same field that also underlies our consciousness, that we can truly
be magicians and extract energy and information out of that field
through our conscious intention.

<br><br>

So,
someday I see, envisioned, small solid-state devices that could go
into your circuit breaker box or under the hood of your car.

<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
also cold fusion, which is also called low-temperature,
non-radioactive nuclear reactions. There&rsquo;s a lot of confusion
about cold fusion. [laughter]
<br><br>

Two
University of Utah chemists, Stanley Pons and Martin Fleishmann,
discovered that, when you put a palladium cathode into a solution of
heavy water, nuclear reactions would occur on the cathode. No
radioactivity, but a great deal of heat resulted in the reactions and
the formation of helium from hydrogen.
<br><br>

Since
1989, there have been many replications of these experiments and yet,
20 years later, the mainstream media is just beginning to <I>discover
cold fusion</I>.

<br><br>

Then
we also have advanced hydrogen and water technologies. These are
special forms of hydrogen and water that can actually produce more
energy than goes into the system, as measured by traditional means.

<br><br>

So,
if we look, for the past one hundred years
&ndash; since the time of
Tesla -- there&rsquo;ve
been hundreds of new energy researchers, but they&rsquo;ve been
suppressed by powerful interests.

<br><br>

Only
with modest investments, can we make the necessary breakthroughs.
<br><br>

Okay,
okay. Now, many mainstream scientists, including <I>myself</I>
about 30 years ago, quoted our own bibles that basically said this
violates the laws of thermodynamics.

<br><br>

Well,
the laws of thermodynamics are not <I>laws</I>.
They&rsquo;re only <I>theories</I>
that apply to a certain narrow range of conditions. This is one case
in which mainstream science is corrupted; many other examples, too.
<br><br>

Another
myth of free energy is that it&rsquo;s so advanced [that] it must be
further off into the future. So, let&rsquo;s do what&rsquo;s in front
of us &ndash; windmills and solar collectors. And, I&rsquo;m not
saying windmills and solar collectors are bad, by the way. I think
they&rsquo;ll have many practical applications, especially at remote
sites.

<br><br>

But,
to make this assumption that it&rsquo;s so advanced, would be like to
debate whether... airships, dirigibles, or balloons... which one to
choose after the Wright Brothers first flew in 1903.
<br><br>

The
final myth is that we can trust governments and the marketplace to
support the research and development. Nothing could be further from
the truth!
<br><br>

So,
who are the suppressors of new energy? It turns out to be just about
all of us, [laughs] and that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t have it.

<br><br>

There
are the scientists, and we have already heard this, that <I>scientism</I>
-- which itself is a religion, the religion of science, as it&rsquo;s
currently exercised in the Western world -- totally ignores the
effects of consciousness, healing and other&hellip; many, many other
new sciences<B>
</B>that are longing
to be born.

<br><br>

The
environmentalists are suppressing new energy &ndash; the people that
call themselves environmentalists. And if you don&rsquo;t believe me,
try to reach Al Gore or any of the Green Party people. Mainstream
environmentalism is very cautious.

<br><br>

The
most powerful governments and the large corporations are also
suppressing free energy, because their own vested interests are
threatened. So, they&rsquo;re in denial of it, while some of the rest
of us get angry. [laughs] Sort of like the denial, and then anger&hellip;


<br><br>

And,
by the way, Elisabeth
K&uuml;bler-Ross&rsquo;s next phase of grieving is usually
<I>bargaining</I>:
<I>Yeah, maybe this part of
the government will support the work. Maybe this corporation over
here would want to do it. </I>But
it&rsquo;s like fitting square pegs in round holes.

<br><br>

And
we have the mainstream media. Oh boy, do they ever love to spin
stories!

<br><br>

And
now, 20 years after the cold fusion discovery, with hundreds of
replications and a worldwide scientific community of cold fusion
researchers, <I>60 Minutes</I>
on CBS finally ran a segment on cold fusion. But, they act as if:
<I>Well, you know, this thing
isn&rsquo;t real; but, maybe, it is after all </I>&ndash;
<I>because</I>
<I>they</I>
discovered it!
<br><br>

So,
so many vested interests are threatened by the <I>possibility</I>
of an abundant, sustainable future with clean, breakthrough energy.
<br><br>

We
had a number of meetings among some of the well-known inventors and
researchers of new energy, in Colorado, in 1993 and &rsquo;94.
There&rsquo;re some very well-known people in this picture, including
Stefan Marinov, who was the physicist on the physics faculty,
University of Graz, in Austria. He <I>fell
to his death</I> a few years
ago... likely not to be a suicide.
<br><br>

Okay,
so what we&rsquo;re going to do in the very near future is to break
for air, because it&rsquo;s my understanding, it&rsquo;s rather hot
in here, isn&rsquo;t it? We&rsquo;re gonna have a five-minute break
for air, so we can breathe.

<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

[resuming
after the break]
<br><br>

BR:
Life may sometimes be full of surprises and we&rsquo;re all creating
this experience that we&rsquo;re having right now. So, ladies and
gentlemen, I would like to introduce to you my friend and colleague,
Henry Deacon.

<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

HENRY
DEACON (HD):  Hello. I&rsquo;ve been waiting many years to say
something. Three years with&hellip; what, three years with Camelot?

<br><br>

BR:
Three years.
<br><br>

HD:
Waiting for a moment to feel right. Just a little thing inspired me
[that] Brian said, about cold fusion. So many people I know don&rsquo;t
believe&hellip; still don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s real.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
still unsure about saying this, but once you say it, it&rsquo;s over.
<br><br>

Here's
my American passport. [holds up passport] Notice its color.
<br><br>

DAVID
WILCOCK (DW):  It's brown, for those of you who can't see it from the
audience.
<br><br>

HD:
It's not the normal color, okay? Just to show that my background is
different. It's a government passport, for official business.
<br><br>

DW:
 It says <I>Official</I>
on it and has special government identification inside which he's
showed me and I can verify.
<br><br>

HD:
I no longer... I have not been employed. I have no income, other than
disability for four, five years now, since I left everything.
<br><br>

What
I'd like, simply, to address the cold fusion. I mentioned to Brian
that, when I was at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey,
California, it was open to the public. I don't think it is now; it
may not be. But, this is strongly identifying the location at that
time, the location of what I'm about to talk about.
<br><br>

In
the basement of the Physics Department building, there were some
experiments on the <I>Casimir
Effect</I>. [to Brian] What
is the Casimir Effect?
<br><br>

BO'L:
 It's a special capacitor that produces over-unity energy. It's been
shown, time and time again, in various physics laboratories. And it's
been demonstrated in several laboratories.
<br><br>

HD:
To use the... it's to tap the zero-point energy.
<br><br>

BO'L:
 That&rsquo;s correct.
<br><br>

HD:
And, it wasn't even in a classified room; but, unless... if you
walked by and didn't know about it, you wouldn't know what was going
on. Because, it's in the postgraduate school environment, which
caters to military and government &ndash; the civilian component of
the government of high rank &ndash; who go there for graduate,
postgraduate-level research.

<br><br>

So,
it's just a very small thing, but it definitely makes it very solid
and real, and I've identified a location. So, as of this... once it
hits the Internet...
<br><br>

TRANSLATOR:
 Excuse me, could you say the geographic location again?
<br><br>

HD:
Monterey, California, near Carmel, California. I worked with
different professors on many different projects, including a space
satellite that went... was launched on the Space Shuttle mission one
hundred and something, with John Glenn, his last mission. A hundred
and fifty, or something like that.

<br><br>

I
don't want to go anymore, because I don't want to take any more time,
but just that is enough. This could go on forever.
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

I do
want to thank David for sharing the room. [David laughs] Except, I
wish he didn&rsquo;t read my mind all the time. [laughter]
<br><br>

DW:
 Well, the fact of the matter is that my other witness, Daniel,
confirmed that Monsanto made a little box about this big, and you
could run your whole house on it. They were used in many, many space
probes, and it has been available since at least the &rsquo;60s. [to
Henry] Can you confirm that?
<br><br>

HD:
Oh, yes, absolutely. And then, Brian, talking about palladium...
well, I actually purchased some palladium a few years ago. [laughs]
It has very interesting properties of absorbing hydrogen and being
able to separate... it&rsquo;s a great storage medium for hydrogen
gas, a safe storage medium. So, maybe, it&rsquo;s above value now; we
don&rsquo;t know where it will head. [laughs]
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Yeah. The point here, really, is that there are so many
technologies. Even in the break, some people came up to me and said:
<I>Did you know about this
person, or this person, or this person?</I>


<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
everywhere and, yet, it&rsquo;s still been held back. So, at this
point, our job is to become more public about it, and to demand that
we are allowed to develop this in a way that&rsquo;s socially
responsible.

<br><br>

The
photographs that I&rsquo;m about to show are of some of the
inventors, some of the many inventors, that are very lonely and
isolated. There&rsquo;s this device here; there&rsquo;s this device
that&rsquo;s official.

<br><br>

So
we&rsquo;re dealing with almost an embarrassment of riches, meaning
there are so many different devices, so many technologies -- any one,
or some of which, could do the trick.

<br><br>

In a
way, it&rsquo;s really remarkable how complete the suppression has
been. And yet, to my way of thinking, it&rsquo;s our next step in our
quest for a new science and a world of sustainability.

<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER:  Is he putting his life on the line by coming out on this
stage? [Referring to Henry Deacon.]
<br><br>

DW:
You bet your ass he is. [applause]
<br><br>

HD:
Someone last night told me I had gray hair. [laughs] So, yes, a
friend.

<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 But it isn&rsquo;t white yet. [laughter]
<br><br>

HD:
 It may turn that way pretty quickly now. [laughs] I would like to
mention something else that&rsquo;s offline
for just a minute, if it&rsquo;s okay. It had to do with something
last night, but it&rsquo;s positive.

<br><br>

Dr.
John Mack of Harvard University who... how many people here have
heard of him? Okay.
<br><br>

DW:
About half.
<br><br>

HD:
Someone explain who he was. I can&rsquo;t exactly do that.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 I could. He was a good friend of mine, a close colleague of mine. He
was a professor of psychiatry at Harvard University, who did
extraterrestrial abduction research. He was, unfortunately, killed in
an automobile accident &ndash;
this one may have really been
an accident &ndash;
in London about three or four years ago.

<br><br>

His
abduction research is very important, because he discovered that the
most common denominator of the messages that the ETs gave to the
abductees, was to express how perilous our environmental situation is
on the Earth. And this is directly out of his latest book, <I>Passport
to the Cosmos</I>.

<br><br>

And
I share that concern. You can see that Meredith and I are both just
tremendously concerned about the future of our Earth. And, as the
result of this research of John Mack&rsquo;s,
he came to the same conclusion.
<br><br>

HD:
He had a... before I go on with that. I realize more and more --
especially since I, for some reason, started working with David, even
at a distance -- once you get locked in and go with the flow of the
Universe, for lack of a better word, something very magical happens.
Everything you are [gets] synchronized in; everything happens in
amazing ways; and each of us can do, no matter who you are, can
change the whole future of the whole world &ndash; each of you.
[applause]

<br><br>

Yes,
you have to be patient, sometimes, and wait and not push things.

<br><br>

Back
to Dr. John Mack:
When I went back to school, and went back to graduate school for
further education; I was at Purdue University, and I learned
something new, a new technique. It was called <I>Yang
Chen Qi Gong. </I>

<br><br>

The
first day I went, it was in the Student Union, and they had an
advertisement on the wall; it says <I>the
meeting is at this night, at this time.</I>
And I would look in the door -- many doors where the meetings were,
for different clubs -- and I looked in the door and it was dark, like
nobody there.

<br><br>

So,
I tried next week... still dark. So, I just opened the door, and
there&rsquo;re some people; they&rsquo;re all just sitting on the
floor, complete silence in the dark, and they&rsquo;re all Chinese. I
sat down, and I understood what was going on after about a week or
so, [laughs] and I started practicing this method.

<br><br>

And,
anyway, I won&rsquo;t go into <I>Yang
Chen Qi Gong</I>
anymore
at the moment. But, later, I learned that
Dr. Mack went
to China, not too long before he died, to investigate some phenomena
with his abductees. And, in general, many of his abductees had been
practicing this. It&rsquo;s a meditation, a form of meditation.

<br><br>

And
two of the people that were advanced there were well known and
documented in the university, and now they&rsquo;re all professors in
different places in the world. Well, especially, one named Dr. Fonzu;
[Ed note: Unsure about the spelling.] he was in a state of non-eating
for many months. He didn&rsquo;t have to eat anything; it&rsquo;s
called <I>bigu</I>.


<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;m getting at with John
Mack is that, I think, I
said his abductees -- many of them had been practicing Qi Gong;
but,
I believe it also applies to other forms of meditation, and it
appears that it opens yourself up to contact &ndash; and they can be
good or bad contact. But, I just want to make you aware of that, if
you practice.

<br><br>

So,
when you&rsquo;re practicing, you know, it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re
opening yourself up to that. It&rsquo;s like a beacon.

<br><br>

Okay.
Thank you. [applause]
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Thank you. Well, we have just had a <I>Deacon
Beacon</I>, [laughter]
shedding light on a very important topic.

<br><br>

And
again, the point is that the number of devices and inventors are
scattered all over the world. About 10 years ago, I made a point of
traveling around the world and this [unsure of this word &ldquo;this&rdquo;]
visiting some of them. So, now I&rsquo;m about to show some
photographs of these fellows, if that&rsquo;s appropriate.

<br><br>

BR:
Just before you start that, Brian, I just want to publicly thank
Henry for his contribution here. It&rsquo;s an act of great courage
and great service. And, I want to thank you for your friendship, your
support, and your huge contribution to everything that we are trying
to do here, all of us together in this room.

<br><br>

HD:
This is why I came here.

<br><br>

BR:
And, on behalf of Project Camelot, I would love to invite you to the
Camelot Conference in Los Angeles in September, if you&rsquo;d be
willing to take the stage and share more of your personal
perspectives on the New World that we have waiting for us. We&rsquo;re
not putting you under pressure for any kind of an answer, but is this
something you would consider?

<br><br>

HD:
Can I come in through the Mexican-California border? [laughter]
<br><br>

BR:
We&rsquo;ll smuggle you in, don&rsquo;t worry.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 You have an official passport. [laughter]

<br><br>

BR:
Okay... [applause]
<br><br>

HD:
 You remember <I>2001: A
Space Odyssey</I>? [At] the
end of the movie, there was a star-child. This may have been
mentioned already, a metaphor: <I>This
world is not ending at all. It&rsquo;s just going through birth
pangs, birth pains.</I> A
new child, you know? That&rsquo;s all. [applause]
<br><br>

DW:
 Could you briefly say something about what the other people [Ed.
note: referring to ETs] that you&rsquo;ve met are like to be around?

<br><br>

HD:
 They make you feel very, very happy and good -- almost all of them.
When he says <I>people</I>...
just we&rsquo;re all <I>people</I>
in this Galaxy -- maybe a little bit different-looking; but, it&rsquo;s
like different flowers, that&rsquo;s all.

<br><br>

So,
usually, it&rsquo;s a very elating, uplifting feeling. You may laugh.
The first time -- you&rsquo;ll be laughing, that&rsquo;s all.

<br><br>

So,
if you see something -- like in the <I>Report
from Iron Mountain</I> --
many of the possible things to... alternatives to war, creating
fictitious enemies; one of the things that was listed in there in the
early &rsquo;60s was a threat from outer space.

<br><br>

You
can look at that report. It is not fictitious at all. President John
Kennedy asked that the Rand Corporation think-tank about the
desirability of ending wars and bringing about peace
&ndash; what the feasibility
and possibility would be.

<br><br>

So
the conventional-thinking geniuses came up with alternatives; that&rsquo;s
all, alternatives to war.

<br><br>

They
thought that, if they took all the money that went into war and into
the national reconnaissance organizations, that they would be able to
feed and house everyone on the planet. And then what would the people
do?

<br><br>

So,
we have to have something; so, we create enemies. Just like George
Orwell... we create threats. We create environmental menace. That was
mentioned: environmental menace.

<br><br>

This
was written... this
report was put out in
the &rsquo;60s. You can see -- it&rsquo;s all happening.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 It&rsquo;s very sobering, isn&rsquo;t it? The conventional thinkers
and the scenarios they come up with, which always seem to involve
control. We have to think differently.

<br><br>

HD:
 Think <I>different</I>.
...Apple computer. [laughter]
<br><br>

DW:
I would like to say, while we&rsquo;re on stage, that there was one
time when I was on the phone with Henry.
<br><br>

HD:
No. Mr. Neumann, the real name.

<br><br>

DW:
 Mr. Neumann, the real name,
and he was called by one of these clandestine agencies, and he put it
on speaker phone on his cell phone. I witnessed the entire
conversation take place between them. For someone to try to tell me
that he set this up is pathetic. It was completely random, after we&rsquo;d
been talking for three hours.

<br><br>

HD:
 That&rsquo;s how you run away, and it&rsquo;s like the movie, <I>The
Prisoner.</I> You run away,
and then they find you, and they offer you work, and then you run
away again, and they offer you another job.

<br><br>

DW:
I would say that Henry, or Art, as his real name is, is the
most-knowledgeable witness ever to come forward in human history
about these projects. I again want to personally thank you for
volunteering to do this for all of us. I do consider you a hero for
doing this.
<br><br>

HD:
It&rsquo;s just what I came here for. [applause]
<br><br>

[Ed
note: &lsquo;Henry Deacon&rsquo; is Art Neumann for the record, so
all references to &lsquo;Henry Deacon&rsquo; (HD) will include Art
Neumann, hence (HD/AN) from this point on.]
<br><br>

DW:
Brian, what world would we have if these technologies get freed up?
What can we visualize for the future?
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 It would be a world of great abundance, if it&rsquo;s properly
managed. It&rsquo;s a big <I>IF.</I>
And so, it&rsquo;s up to us to create social systems to facilitate
the ethical use of these technologies.

<br><br>

They
are truly breakthrough. For example, you could have pure water simply
by desalinating the ocean water.

<br><br>

But
there are many, many other things that can happen, too. You can have
abundant food. Because, you see, energy no longer is a block.

<br><br>

The
kind of new world that one visualizes here very quickly becomes a
very, very good world. And, part of the good news about this is that
we can plan it. We can plan this program, the whole thing, including
making the transition as painless as possible.

<br><br>

The
United States Department of Energy recently issued a request for
proposals about new energy technologies. I responded to the proposal,
and I called it <I>Impacts of
a Breakthrough Energy Economy.</I>


<br><br>

In
the proposal, I proposed a novel idea, which is to develop
&ndash; even if it&rsquo;s
hypothetical &ndash; a
question: <I>What are public
attitudes toward a world of breakthrough energy?</I>
Let&rsquo;s bring this discussion out to the public. Let&rsquo;s be
open about this. So, that was part of the proposal.

<br><br>

The
other was to get together a number of people, like as an advisory
group without vested interests, to advise on scenarios of a clean
breakthrough energy future. So far, that hasn&rsquo;t been done. It&rsquo;s
been kept secret, and now we have to be willing to be bold enough to
think about such a future.

<br><br>

Guess
how much money I asked for, for the study. One dollar. [laughter]The
reason for that, of course, is that energy, like everything else,
should be our birthright. At the very least, a world of breakthrough
energy will buy us some time, so that we can truly plan a sustainable
future for the Earth.

<br><br>

DW:
I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing more of these slides. Do you have
other technologies?

<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Yes. Let&rsquo;s look at that.
<br><br>

DW:
But, that was great; that was great. [applause]
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Well, let&rsquo;s do it. Okay.
<br><br>

DW:
Because this is provable stuff. You&rsquo;re saying these guys have
hardware and it already works, right?
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Oh yeah! This is a trip I took about 10 years ago, all around the
world. For example, Paramahamsa Tewari
has a magnetic motor which the government of India has given him,
actually, money and laboratory space to develop this.

<br><br>

He
starts it up as a generator, then he unplugs it and it&rsquo;s a
free-running motor &ndash; or a free-running generator. It&rsquo;s
the other way round. He starts it as a motor and, then, it becomes a
free-running generator.

<br><br>

Suji
Inumata had another
such device in Japan.

<br><br>

Some
of you may have heard of Yull
Brown. He developed
Brown&rsquo;s gas, which is a very special form of water, which
people are now using to burn cleaner fuels, as additives, and also to
actually run cars on water.

<br><br>

Next
one: This is a welding device that Yull Brown developed from Brown&rsquo;s
gas, which is really extraordinary.

<br><br>

Sparky
Sweet &ndash;
I talked about that in the workshop this morning. He&rsquo;s a
retired engineer from General Electric, and he has in his hand a
specially-conditioned magnet which lit up a bank of light bulbs.

<br><br>

Next
slide, please: John Hutchison, Canadian inventor, who is sort of like
a reincarnated Nikola Tesla, and is able to create anti-gravity. This
was an <I>aluminium</I>
&ndash; that&rsquo;s how
Canadians call aluminum &ndash;
bar, and he thrashed it with huge amounts of energy he was able to
generate.

<br><br>

Next
slide: Tom Bearden &ndash; with a little artistic license here &ndash;
Tom is still with us on the Earth, and he&rsquo;s a brilliant
theoretician of free energy.

<br><br>

How
many of you have heard of Tom Bearden? Yeah, about half of you, a
little less; he wrote a book called <I>Energy
from the Vacuum</I>. It&rsquo;s
very technical, but he, basically &ndash; his bottom-line message is
that the electrical engineers have Maxwell&rsquo;s equations all
wrong. They neglect the most important term in Maxwell&rsquo;s
equation, which is the so-called <I>scalar</I>
term, which contains, basically, the information you need to extract
energy from the zero-point energy field.

<br><br>

These
things are very hard to explain, by the way, and you probably want to
see a device right on the table now in front of you. For that, I
apologize. What we really need to have is a concerted effort among
engineers and inventors to bring this to the next level of proof.

<br><br>

Many
people think you can just go down to Wal-Mart and buy your own free
energy gizmo, but we&rsquo;re not there yet. It takes time and money
and effort to get to the point where we&rsquo;ll have the gizmo on
the table.

<br><br>

So,
at this point, the important thing is to visualize that it&rsquo;s
possible to have this. You don&rsquo;t even have to <I>believe</I>
it; [laughter] just visualize the possibility, and, then, ask the
question: <I>Why aren&rsquo;t
we doing it?</I>

<br><br>

Should
we not leave no stone unturned in our quest for clean energy? It&rsquo;s
a very logical question, if we want a sustainable future for planet
Earth.

<br><br>

Next
slide: This is a very sad story. Eugene Mallove was editor of
<I>Infinite Energy</I>
magazine. He was the chief science writer for MIT, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and he was assigned the job of debunking or
ridiculing the original discovery of cold fusion.

<br><br>

Some
nuclear physicists at MIT were not... or claimed not to be able to
replicate the experiment. But these were nuclear physicists who had a
very strong vested interest in their own hot fusion Tokomak reactors,
a concept that has, so far, cost the U.S. government and taxpayers
tens of billions of dollars.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
 It keeps them employed, though. [laughter]
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 But they knew nothing about electrochemistry, which is what this
concept is all about.

<br><br>

So
Eugene Mallove discovered that the nuclear physicists actually
committed fraud and fudged the data, so as to make it look like they
did not replicate it, which led the late Sir Arthur C. Clarke to say:
<I>T</I><I>his
could well be the greatest scandal in scientific history.</I>
This was in 1989, 1990.

<br><br>

And
now, for 20 years, hundreds of people have replicated and done
successful cold fusion experiments.

<br><br>

And
then, we&rsquo;ll interject something here that David just informed
me about. Because you would think that: <I>Okay
it works -- where&rsquo;s the tabletop device? Let&rsquo;s make one.
Let&rsquo; just do it! It should be easy. </I>

<br><br>

Well,
it hasn&rsquo;t been quite as easy as you might expect, for at least
two reasons. The one reason that I am familiar with is that many of
these free energy devices respond to the consciousness of the
experimenter. This is reminiscent of particle physics experiments, in
which the observer changes the properties of the observed.

<br><br>

So,
many rigorous scientists have not touched cold fusion because they
believe that because it doesn&rsquo;t work <I>all</I>
the time, it doesn&rsquo;t work <I>any</I>
of the time. And, David, you have another explanation about why it
may work sometimes and not work sometimes.
<br><br>

DW:
I was talking yesterday about how all 4,000 pyramids and ancient
sites have been built on this geometric grid around the Earth. These
geometric lines represent where the most torsion-field energy comes
from. When you have a cold fusion device on or near one of these
lines, it will work very well.

<br><br>

The
<I>60 Minute</I>s
documentary he spoke of revealed that, in some places, it doesn&rsquo;t
work at all. This is almost certainly because those areas are not on
the grid.

<br><br>

I
would also like to say something about Dr. Eugene Mallove, if you
don&rsquo;t mind.

<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Go ahead.
<br><br>

DW:
He had a working tabletop device that always worked. The only person
he told about this was my colleague, Richard Hoagland. They were
about to go to Washington, D.C. and show it to Senators. They were
going to announce this on the air with me on a Saturday night. Friday
afternoon, [speaking emotionally] Dr. Eugene Mallove was bludgeoned
to death in his back yard.

<br><br>

[sighs]
The killing has to stop. [applause]
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 I know. It really upset me a great deal when it happened, because at
the time, I had founded the New Energy Movement, and he was going to
be the keynote speaker. And I became the keynote speaker and moved to
Ecuador. [David laughs]
<br><br>

Not
out of fear, actually, because Meredith and I enjoy our life there
very, very much. So, that wasn&rsquo;t the only reason, but I was
very upset for quite a while when that happened.

<br><br>

And
another tragic example is Stefan Marinov. Actually, he&rsquo;s in
that picture too. He&rsquo;s the man on the right and up a little
bit.

<br><br>

DW:
In the gray sweater.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Okay, the one in the middle. That&rsquo;s Stefan Marinov. I knew him
well. He was a physics professor at the University of Graz
in
Austria. He was found
jumping &ndash; but
I think the right story is falling
&ndash; from the 10th story
of the library building at the University of Graz about four years
ago.

<br><br>

He
was a very jolly person. And one eyewitness saw him falling
backwards, falling backwards, as if he were pushed. He left no
suicide note, and he was one of the most positive, highly-spirited
persons I&rsquo;ve ever met. He was sort of like the head of the
European free energy movement. This happened about four years ago.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
 Don&rsquo;t be afraid of dying. It&rsquo;s just changing form.
[applause]
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 That&rsquo;s why the concept of karma is so important.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
 It all depends on what you want to do here, if you can, first.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 By the way, the other scientist on the left here, Randall Mills, he
founded BlackLight Power, which is a very special form of hydrogen in
which he found that energy states of hydrogen can be lower than the
traditional ground state.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
 How low can you get?
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Quite low and you can get about 100 times more energy out of a
hydrogen plasma tube, than you could get with ordinary hydrogen. And
he&rsquo;s discovered... well, he&rsquo;s made many discoveries in
this and has even developed a theory around it called Classical
Quantum Mechanics.

<br><br>

I
think that, having been in the world of physics myself -- it&rsquo;s
fair to say that physics is in for a big change. And unfortunately,
like the particle collider here in Switzerland, and many other
<I>state-of-the-art</I>
kinds of directions, it&rsquo;s not as fertile direction as free
energy and the new science of consciousness.

<br><br>

And,
isn&rsquo;t it interesting that quantum theory itself predicts and
shows that consciousness does exist? Because the act of observation
creates the physical reality you observe! Most physicists ignore that
fact and go about their materialistic ways.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
 Well, at Livermore many, many, many decades ago, I found it quite
novel that, after some research of the top scientists under Edward
Teller, they were passing around a book to each other called <I>The
Tao of Physics.</I>

<br><br>

[inaudible
comment from audience]
<br><br>

HD/AN:
 <I>The Way &ndash;</I>
it was a metaphysical book, you know, because they realized what was
going on a long time ago at the Q-level clearance, Above Top Secret.


<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Edward Teller, by the way, is the father of the hydrogen bomb;
basically originated the Star Wars program for Ronald Reagan, and
loved to create chemtrails and other things in space to screen out
sunlight to offset global warning
&ndash; and does it with
great delight, like Dr. Strangelove.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
 Edward, would you please explain where you&rsquo;re coming from? I
still don&rsquo;t understand you.


<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 And, by the way, he&rsquo;s passed over, but he was certainly quite
a stereotype of a boss.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
 His two babies were Los
Alamos National Labs &ndash;
that was his big baby &ndash; and
then Livermore National Labs, which was Livermore Labs, his second
baby.
<br><br>

DW:
But you wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about those?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
 No. And then, [it was] interesting how they kept changing the name,
and that [was] very expensive, changing the name of Livermore Labs.
It was Lawrence Livermore Labs; then they changed it to Lawrence
Livermore National Labs &ndash; and, at the same time, it was the
United States Atomic Energy Commission &ndash; and, then, it was the
U.S. Energy Research Department
&ndash; ERDA.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Oh yes, Energy Research and Development Administration.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
 And, then, it was Energy Research and Development Agency, so they
had to change all the paperwork again. Then they changed it to the
Department of Energy. It was all the same thing. I don&rsquo;t
understand that.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 By the way, the U.S. Energy Department spends approximately... I
think it&rsquo;s $30 billion dollars a year, maybe it&rsquo;s more
now, and it&rsquo;s almost all on fossil fuel and nuclear energy
research and nuclear weapons.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
 In 1976 or so, we had a meeting. I had to go a big meeting, a
high-level conference, classified conference, in a big auditorium and
they put up a graph up here, a projection of oil reserves. And, then,
they said in 30 years, we&rsquo;ll be running out of oil, and that
was Top Secret. I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on. It&rsquo;s
confusing. Why was that Top Secret? And is it true, we&rsquo;re
running out of oil?

<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Yeah. The known oil reserves on the Earth will give us another 30 to
100 years, depending on how fast we gobble it up.

<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
a whole movement called the Peak Oil Movement, who believes that
we&rsquo;re now at the top, at peak production of oil, and then we
are going to descend the slippery slope of scarcity.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
 That&rsquo;s what we were told at the meeting.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 And, that&rsquo;s what you were told at the meeting. It&rsquo;s
obvious. It&rsquo;s out there in the public domain. I think some of
the scarcity is created artificially. But, regardless of how you
think of it, the hydrocarbon age that we&rsquo;re now in is a
dinosaur. Literally.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
 Oh, one simple thing. I keep interrupting.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Go ahead.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
 I wanted to mention that I was very surprised... because, you know,
it&rsquo;s over for me now. Bye-bye. No... [laughs]

<br><br>

Project
Shiva &ndash; Shiva
Nova &ndash; a
laser fusion project; you can look it up on the Internet. It&rsquo;s
on BBC lately: <I>Oh, laser
fusion. Something new</I>.
That&rsquo;s
what they finished in the &rsquo;70s. Most American
scientists were not even allowed access to that project.

<br><br>

When
I went in to the project, I was very surprised at the scientists I
saw there, where they were from. Red China! Our technology, that
technology, American science technology at the highest levels, was
being given to the top Chinese people, in Red China -- what does that
mean?

<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
Okay. Maybe we should move along here, and I&rsquo;ll show a few more
here, because we have been told we&rsquo;re going to have a break at
4:30, which is 15 minutes from now. So, like David yesterday, I&rsquo;m
going to fast-forward! [David laughs]
<br><br>

What
I want to point out is that we have had a few meetings among free
energy researchers. This is quite a distinguished group, with a
little artistic license as well.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ll
just mention a few names: Tom Bearden, Hal Puthoff, Peter Graneau
from MIT. [indicates a man in photograph] That&rsquo;s Peter Graneau,
me, Meredith. And Jim Carrey! What is Jim Carrey doing in a group of
free energy eggheads? Well, he was filming <I>Dumb
and Dumber,</I> while we were
trying to get smart and smarter! [laughter, applause]
<br><br>

There&rsquo;re
some other distinguished&hellip; There&rsquo;re Stefan Marinov;
Paramahamsa Tewari from India; Suji Inumata; and many, many other
recognizable people.

<br><br>

Unfortunately,
the software billionaire that funded this effort, decided not to fund
any of our work, because we were <I>not
dipping into the river of optimized profits.</I>
[snorts like a pig]
<br><br>

Next
slide: We&rsquo;ll go through these rather quickly. Let&rsquo;s just
go on. Two more. A good Tom Bearden quote, but not enough time.

<br><br>

Adam
Trombly. Adam is a close colleague of mine and somebody who came up
with a free energy device way back, about 30 years ago. He was told
by the U.S. Department of Defense to never work on this again, and
had his device confiscated. So, he started Project Earth, following
the tradition of Buckminster Fuller.

<br><br>

I
think it&rsquo;s a wonderful quote and I&rsquo;ll say it: <I>There
is a limitless and practically-useful energy anywhere you stand or
sit. We can feel it and we can be it. We can tap into this with real
technologies. We can light our homes and drive our quiet clean
vehicles as the wounds of our tortured Earth are healed forever.
Let&rsquo;s take our planet back. Let&rsquo;s start now!</I>
[applause]
<br><br>

Okay,
now we have to really move fast because my pre-programmed talk is
being truncated.

<br><br>

Here&rsquo;s
Buckminster Fuller. Shortly before his death, Buckminster Fuller came
into knowledge that free energy existed. And he was such a positive
thinker. He was overjoyed. He said: <I>I&rsquo;m
glad I have lived long enough to see this. It is simply wonderful! I
hope and pray you will live long enough to see the principle upon
which this artifact is based become the new energy source for all
passengers on Spaceship Earth.</I>
<br><br>

Next
slide: At Montesue&ntilde;os, our retreat, we had what&rsquo;s called
the <I>Phoenix Gathering</I>
about a year ago. This was a group of visionaries that flew in from
all over the world, and we were given one question to ask ourselves:
<I>How can we create a
sustainable future for the Earth?</I>


<br><br>

What
I discovered during the course of this one-week intensive workshop
was that there were different cultures represented, who weren&rsquo;t
talking with one another. And so, for example, the issue of free
energy was not considered important, because the people came in with
pre-conceived ideas about what kind of future we should have.

<br><br>

It
brings back the famous Bertrand Russell quote: <I>The
resistance to a new idea increases as the square of its importance.</I>
So, we&rsquo;re talking about supplanting a multi-trillion dollar
hydrocarbon / nuclear energy economy.


Next
slide: This is just photographs of the conference. And, so we had
these different cultures. We had the pragmatists lead by a
progressive lawyer from New York; and, because I couldn&rsquo;t give
him a ten-minute explanation for free energy, he denied it.

<br><br>

Then,
the deep ecologists &ndash;
these are the people that
really think the Earth is in deep trouble. But, they also, maybe,
reflect a lot of the Green Movement, in that they&rsquo;re not
looking at visionary solutions, but going back to the farm.

<br><br>

Then
there are the truth-seekers, which is represented by a lot of people
in this room, that really want to know what&rsquo;s going on behind
the scenes.

<br><br>

And,
then, the spiritualists&mdash;these are people that see the Unity in
everything.

<br><br>

But,
the people weren&rsquo;t talking with one another, and I&rsquo;m
going to suggest that we need some of all of these features to do the
necessary synthesis.

<br><br>

Next
slide: Arthur C. Clarke, the late Arthur C. Clarke: <I>Any
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</I>
<br><br>

Next
one: Martin Luther King: <I>To
ignore evil is to become an accomplice to it.</I>
And that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we need to go and blame evil, and
fight them, but we should be willing to understand that malevolence
does exist, and we need to do something about it.
<br><br>

Next
slide: So, this is the conclusion of this talk in my new book:
<I>Embracing the Possibility
of Breakthrough Energy, or what I call an &ldquo;energy solution
revolution,&rdquo; should be our Mandate, not an idle speculation to
be ignored, ridiculed, or feared.</I>
<br><br>

Next
slide: Well, I&rsquo;m just going to show about four slides. I was
going to do a whole piano/slide gig, but I&rsquo;m not going to do
that now...

<br><br>

VOICE:
Boo... [laughter]
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
...because I want to give Bill his allotted time.

<br><br>

But
these are photographs... Basically Meredith and I, over the past five
years, have created a beautiful retreat in the Andes of Ecuador. For
example, last January, Bill, and Kerry, and George Green came, and we
had two conferences, actually. One was called &ldquo;Crisis and
Opportunity.&rdquo;

<br><br>

The
other was called <I>The
Camelot Conference</I>,
appropriately called, because I&rsquo;m sure that, in coming up with
the name <I>Project Camelot</I>,
it goes back to the days when there was visionary thinking, where
there was the Good King, or the energy of the Good King, that wanted
to help humanity. Even the years of John F. Kennedy were called &ldquo;The
Camelot Years&rdquo;.

<br><br>

Our
goal in creating Montesue&ntilde;os, which is really Spanish for
&ldquo;mountain dreams&rdquo;, was to hold these kinds of events, to
create a new world, if we can take it.

<br><br>

And
so, in the next three or four slides, we&rsquo;ll just show you some
architectural shots. It&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful spots I&rsquo;ve
ever seen on the planet. So, we have two main buildings, eight
bedrooms, plenty of conference space, and we warmly invite you to
come to one of our conferences or to just stay and relax with us.

<br><br>

And
this is the new book, <I>The
Energy Solution Revolution,</I>
which this talk was all about.
<br><br>

The
next slide is the last slide. Well, that&rsquo;s the next-to-last
slide, I think. [laughter] That&rsquo;s one of the views from
Montesue&ntilde;os. And I know, Bill, you had a good time. [laughter]


<br><br>

I
have to explain this for one minute [referring to last slide], if I
may have one more minute. You heard a reference last night to the
<I>Lapis Pig</I>.
Here he is, the original.

<br><br>

Now,
he has a swelled head. He believes that the bankers have it right,
and that the military-industrial complex is very good. So, even
though he has been designated guardian of our Treasury, he has this
vision of having a statue created of himself, 100 meters high, made
of pure <I>lapis lazuli.</I>


<br><br>

He&rsquo;s
just collected $287-billion dollars on credit default swaps with AIG,
and now wants to drill the Amazon for one trillion dollars worth of
oil and become the world&rsquo;s first trillionaire.

<br><br>

This
is an example of reducing what&rsquo;s going on to absurdity. We have
to have fun with this and at the same time experience the emotions of
change.

<br><br>

The
next slide, and I believe the last slide, is our information. The
last slide gives the information about how to reach us.
<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;d like to do is conclude with a one-minute meditation. David
suggested this last night. I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful idea.

<br><br>

And
so, just kind of relax, loosen your clothes, your body and so forth.
And just close your eyes and breathe a deep breath in. Feel the love
and light that&rsquo;s present in this room right now, then let go of
any negativity in your out-breath, any tension, over-active mind,
stress. Just let it all go with each breath, breathing again deeply
from your stomach. Ahhhh... then exhale.

<br><br>

And,
then, imagine now a bright light coming through the top of your head
with each breath in, and allow that light to surround your head and
your whole body. And let that light spread out to the universe for
the highest good of everybody. Let it wrap over the planet Earth, and
let us become empowered to transform ourselves to the light we really
are and the beauty of Nature all around us.

<br><br>

Just
stay with that for about a few seconds. As you breathe in, with each
breath, allowing the light to spread more and more... to your
neighbors, to this room, to the city of Zurich, Switzerland, this
beautiful country; and let the light spread around the world to
everybody.

<br><br>

Let
all negativity dissolve within this light, because, from the darkness
dawns a new light. And one more deep breath in. Then exhale, and then
gradually come back into the room.

<br><br>

We
give thanks for this opportunity to come together at the Volkshaus,
and with gratitude toward Bill, and Ruth, and the Ground Crew, the
other speakers, the translators, that we can create a truly new
world.
<br><br>

Thank
you.
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

RUTH
HUBER (RH), translator, speaking German and then English:  Bill made
the suggestion to finish off the conference and round it up right
now.
<br><br>

BR:
I didn&rsquo;t really have any rousing speech finished for the last
section of today; and, even if I did, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly cap
the presentation and the finale that Brian, aided by Henry and David,
has just offered you here. What I do want to do... I want to ask if
Dan and Marci are in the room. Are they here?
<br><br>

RH:
No.
<br><br>

BR:
They&rsquo;re not around. I don&rsquo;t blame them at all, actually.
I understood they held a wonderful workshop this morning, and they
deserve a little bit of time and space, and that&rsquo;s wonderful.
<br><br>

What
I do want to do is just stress again that here we&rsquo;ve seen in
front of us the opportunity that we have of creating the experience
that we want.

<br><br>

I
want to thank everyone who made this possible. I want to thank Ruth,
who&rsquo;s shared this vision with me, and held it through a lot of
interesting times for many months, and, without whom, this would not
have happened.
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

I
want to thank the Swiss Ground Crew, because it wouldn&rsquo;t have
happened without them either. [applause] Stand up, please. Stand up.
Tina,<B>
</B>stand up.
<br><br>

RH
[in German, then English]:  They did a tremendous amount of work, all
together.
<br><br>

[applause
while Ground Crew, all in red t-shirts, assembles in front of stage]
<br><br>

BR:
We&rsquo;re going to have to do this again sometime; otherwise, I
don&rsquo;t know what people are going to do with these t-shirts.
[laughter]

<br><br>

And
this isn&rsquo;t just the end of a conference. I want you to consider
this as being the start of something else. I want you guys to
organize conferences of your own. I want you guys to speak at
conferences of your own. I want you guys to encourage others to hold
conferences of their own.

<br><br>

Kerry
Cassidy and I are going to be in Barcelona in two weeks&rsquo; time.
We invite you all to come to Barcelona. Art, do you want to come to
Barcelona?
<br><br>

RH:
Yeah. [applause]
<br><br>

HD/AN:
 I&rsquo;ll be there, too. I&rsquo;m trying to find my Excalibur
Sword. [laughter]
<br><br>

BR:
There&rsquo;s a bunch of people holding a conference in Amsterdam on
the 1st of August. So, find anyone with a badge with a Dutch flag on
it and ask them what&rsquo;s going on and they&rsquo;ll tell you.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
been invited to Poland on the 5th and 6th of September. I&rsquo;m
delighted to be going there. I&rsquo;ll go anywhere you like, if you
make the coffee good enough. [laughter] And, so probably would Henry,
except that he likes Lahsee.<B>
</B>[unsure
of word]
<br><br>

And
I have a very strong feeling that all kinds of amazing things are
going to happen at the Camelot conference in Los Angeles on the 19th
and 20th of September. David Wilcock will be there. Henry will be
there, I hope.

<br><br>

HD//AN:
 Immigration problems.
<br><br>

BR:
Immigration problems. Oh, right!

<br><br>

Doctor
Pete Peterson has told us that he will be there. And, based on our
experience this afternoon, who knows who else will be there?
<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
possible that the next time the Swiss Ground Crew will be wearing
their red shirts is for another event here in Zurich, where David
Icke is coming on the 14th of November.
<br><br>

And
so, there&rsquo;s a lot going on, and there has been talk just today
of an event held by the German Ground Crew, and this is being created
as I speak.
<br><br>

Meanwhile,
Brian is holding his own event in August... and I cannot remember the
dates, Brian.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 22nd and 23rd. And I think George Green will be there. We hope you
will be there, but we realize you&rsquo;re traveling a lot, so we can
create another Camelot conference at Montesue&ntilde;os and we hope
you can come.
<br><br>

BR:
Art, are there any immigration problems going to Ecuador?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
 Not that I know of.
<br><br>

BR:
I think you&rsquo;d really like Vilcabamba.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
 I could live 156 years, like I was supposed to. [laughs]
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 Right. It&rsquo;s the Valley of Longevity and very healthy. Fresh
organic food and perfect climate. [applause]
<br><br>

BR:
It&rsquo;s the most wonderful food I&rsquo;ve ever tasted in all of
my life.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
been asked to mention the Free Energy Congress. Brian, you know
exactly about as much of this as I do.
<br><br>

BO&rsquo;L:
 This is actually new to me, but it&rsquo;s in Switzerland.
[translator gives details in German]

<br><br>

BR:
Everything that&rsquo;s happened this weekend is going to be on the
Internet in some form and, for all I know, some of it may already be;
and so, all of this is recorded for a lot more people to be inspired
by than the 300-plus who are here in this room.

<br><br>

I
jumped the gun there, actually, because David, I wanted to ask you,
is there anything that you are doing that you would like to mention
here and invite people to take part in?

<br><br>

DW:
I will be speaking at The Secrets Conference in Phoenix, Arizona,
[November 21-24, 2009] and I&rsquo;ll be sharing the stage at some
point with Disclosure pioneer, Dr. Steven Greer, which I&rsquo;m very
happy about.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
also doing an event in Toronto in September, and that&rsquo;s the
weekend of September 11th. I&rsquo;ll be speaking the entire weekend
and singing some of my new music, so you get about 16 hours of the
kind of lecture content you saw yesterday.

<br><br>

In
November, I have a five-day resort getaway vacation in Hawaii that
will be happening; and, next summer, we&rsquo;re going to have a crop
circle tour in England for a week.

<br><br>

In
general I just want to thank every one of you for being here. I only
see reflections of myself and I&rsquo;m very pleased with it. I do
believe there&rsquo;s only one of us here, so please don&rsquo;t tear
me to pieces as I&rsquo;m trying to leave the room. [laughter]

<br><br>

But,
seriously, I hope that what we can all take from this experience is
the gratitude for knowing the truth and the challenge to use it.

<br><br>

Thank
you Bill, for bringing us out here. And Ruth. [applause]
<br><br>

BR:
I want to thank the people who&rsquo;ve been manning the cameras.
It&rsquo;s been quite hard work and you&rsquo;ve done an incredibly
important job back there. Just give a round of applause to the camera
people, without whom this would not be made available to the rest of
the world. [applause]
<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
spent a lot of time on a lot of different planets in the last few
million years, and none of them have had as many countries and
languages as this one. [laughter] So, I want to thank the translators
for doing an invaluable job here this weekend. [applause]
<br><br>

Ruth
Huber...?
<br><br>

RH:
 OK. Ja. Ruth Huber is my name. Ja. [laughs]


<br><br>

BR:
You German-speaking people who are interested in anything to do with
spiritual growth, you&rsquo;ve got to read her book. [applause]
<br><br>

Rob
Fleischer from Exopolitics Germany, [applause] who is going to be
speaking in Barcelona at the Exopolitics Summit.

<br><br>

Thomas
Kirschner from NEXUS Magazine, who has given us a huge amount of
support. [applause]

<br><br>

Kristina
Hollenvager.
[sp?] Kristina, are
you in the room? [applause] Tell her to stand up.
<br><br>

So,
it takes a lot of people and lot of work, a lot of intention, and a
combined vision to hold a conference like this. It&rsquo;s not easy,
but it&rsquo;s worth it. So, don&rsquo;t do the things in life, which
are easy -- do the things in life, which are worth it.

<br><br>

I
want to thank you all for being here. We&rsquo;re going to be around
for a little bit, I think, to talk to people. This is the intention
that we have, is to make ourselves available to talk to people. But,
more importantly, make sure that you talk with each other. This is a
networking event.

<br><br>

We
do hope to see you here again in Zurich sometime. Thank you.

<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

[ends
with Brian O&rsquo;Leary playing piano and the murmur of voices,
people talking to each other in the background]
