We can start. </p>                <p class="style7"><img src="bill_ryan_zurich_2009.jpg" width="500" height="375" hspace="10" align="right">Bill:&nbsp; All right. Is there anyone else                  to come in the room here? </p>                <p class="style7"> All right. So, everybody; welcome to the conference.                  We&rsquo;re                  delighted that you're here, and that you&rsquo;ve made the                  journey from wherever it is you've come from. </p>                <p class="style7">The first thing I want to do - I think you all know who I                  am, Bill Ryan from Project Camelot, but a member of the Swiss                  Ground Crew. I&rsquo;m very, very proud to be part of this                  team. [applause]</p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s something very important to say here about that,                  and I do thank you for giving that spontaneous applause to                  this team. This is not a <em>professional</em> conference. In English,                  the opposite of professional is &ldquo;amateur&rdquo;. For                  those of you, who know Latin, know that the word <em>amateur</em> means <em>people                  who love what they do.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;re not doing this for money. Don&rsquo;t                  ever organize a conference for money! It&rsquo;s not going                  to work. But you might just want to organize a conference because                  you love doing it, and I would highly recommend that.&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">Actually, before I start talking about the                  history of this conference, I want to introduce my <em>alter ego.</em> <img src="bill_ryan_transcript_zurich_2009_sm.jpg" width="300" height="115" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">This                  is Ruth Huber. Ruth is one of the most important people here,                  not only because she&rsquo;s played a huge role in bringing                  this conference together, but also because she&rsquo;s one                  of the key translators. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m trying to embarrass her. [laughter &amp; applause]                  Okay. </p>                <p class="style7">Some people have understandably thought that this was a Project                  Camelot conference. It&rsquo;s not a Project Camelot conference;                  it&rsquo;s a Swiss Ground Crew conference. </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;ve been receiving emails from all over the world,                  and, in a moment, we&rsquo;ll go through what countries you                  all are from because a lot of people have traveled a long way. </p>                <p class="style7">A lot of people write to us and they say: <em>Hey, I&rsquo;m                    part of the Dutch Ground Crew, </em>or<em> the German Ground                    Crew, </em>or<em> the Spanish Ground Crew. </em>It&rsquo;s                    important to realize that the word <em>Ground Crew</em>,                    the phrase &ldquo;ground crew&rdquo; actually came from George                    Green. </p>                <p class="style7">George Green isn&rsquo;t here but he actually has played quite                  a big part in this conference, although his role is sort of                  invisible. </p>                <p class="style7">This conference actually started just before we went &ndash; that                  is, when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean Kerry Cassidy and myself                  from Project Camelot &ndash; went to Ecuador in January of                  this year, and one of the Swiss team here, who is somewhere                  in the audience &ndash; I dare not identify her because she&rsquo;s                  got a lot to answer for&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t get that. </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t get that. [laughter] One of the                  Swiss team here, before we went to Ecuador - and she&rsquo;s                  in the audience here. I&rsquo;m not going to identify her,                  but everything that&rsquo;s happening here is all her fault                  [laughter] &ndash; said to me: <em>When you see George Green                  in Ecuador, can you invite him back to Switzerland? Because                  we would love to have him here.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Now, George Green had all kinds of other plans and he&rsquo;s                  a busy man and he wasn&rsquo;t able to come to Switzerland                  this summer, but when we were talking with Brian O&rsquo;Leary &ndash; Dr.                  Brian O&rsquo;Leary, he&rsquo;s here in the front row. You&rsquo;ll                  be hearing from him on Sunday and also tomorrow evening. </p>                <p class="style7">[to Brian] Stand up, stand up, please. [applause] </p>                <p class="style7">Brian O&rsquo;Leary is a very wonderful man and it&rsquo;s                  my privilege, I think, to be able to call him a good friend.                  He said: <em>Hey, I&rsquo;ll come to Europe. I climbed the                  Matterhorn when I was a young man, I&rsquo;d love to see it                  again.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So we had this idea of this little group of people, and we&rsquo;d                  have Brian maybe in this little room, and we&rsquo;d share                  some coffee together and he&rsquo;d tell some stories to us.                  And then, someone else, who&rsquo;s also in this room and who                  we shouldn&rsquo;t identify, said: <em>You know what? It would                  be really wonderful to invite Dan Burisch to Switzerland.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">I said: <em>There&rsquo;s absolutely no chance of that happening.                    That&rsquo;ll never happen.</em> Then I had an afterthought,                    and I thought: <em>Well, I could just send a mail, it&rsquo;s                    very easy to send a mail.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And he said: <em>Okay. I&rsquo;ll come to Zurich. No                    problem.</em> [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t know whether Dan is in this room right now,                  I think he&rsquo;s coming later. Is Dan here? No. No he&rsquo;s                  not. Dan&rsquo;s coming later because he&rsquo;s still on American                  Pacific Time, which means that he&rsquo;s just sort of starting                  to feel like it&rsquo;s breakfast. [laughter] That&rsquo;s                  why he&rsquo;s on this evening. </p>                <p class="style7">I know that an awful lot of you have come here specifically                  to hear his story. And I&rsquo;ll say a little bit more about                  that in the next hour or so because I want to give Dan as much                  of an introduction as I can because it&rsquo;s a very complicated                  story. </p>                <p class="style7">Then what happened was that we had Brian, and we had Dan.                  Then Dan said: <em>Hey, I want Marci to come.</em> Then people                  were saying: <em>Well, you can stand up and talk to some people,                  too. </em>And then, suddenly, we had a conference. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">We invited David Wilcock; he&rsquo;s never been to Europe                  before. So this is really quite a special event. </p>                <p class="style7">Yesterday evening, for quite a long time late into the night                  -- Dan, Marci, David and myself -- had a two hour video conversation,                  which was so interesting that we practically had to drag David                  and Dan out of their seats at midnight because it could have                  gone on until daylight. That was the first time the four of                  us have actually been in the same place to talk about a lot                  of this material together and that&rsquo;s been recorded on                  video, and that will be released as soon as possible; it&rsquo;s                  interesting stuff. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, before I dive into this interesting stuff, I just want                  to acknowledge the people who have taken up a lot of time,                  spent quite a bit of money and demonstrated a huge amount of                  commitment to be here this weekend. We have people here from                  25 different countries. I just want to read these out to you                  because it&rsquo;s quite impressive. Every time I look at this                  list, I&rsquo;m impressed. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s a list, in alphabetical order. I&rsquo;m not going                  to embarrass you, but I do invite you that, if I read out your                  country, I would love you to raise your hand, so we can actually                  see that you&rsquo;re here. I won&rsquo;t ask you to stand                  up or tell us what your real name is, or anything like that.                  [laughter] And all of you agents in this audience, we hope                  you have fun and it&rsquo;s all cool. [laughter] We hope you                  have a good time. </p>                <p class="style7">Because this is in alphabetical order, who&rsquo;s come here                  from Australia? </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; Ah! [applause] </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that amazing? That blew me away. These                  are not rich people, but they&rsquo;re committed people. They                  have a different kind of wealth. </p>                <p class="style7">So we won&rsquo;t talk about Cricket, okay? [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; We won&rsquo;t talk about...? </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t translate into German. [laughter]                  Okay, and you don&rsquo;t have to give each other rounds of                  applause, because that all wastes a lot of energy, but Austria                  is the next one. </p>                <p class="style7">All right. Good. Belgium? All right. Canada. Who&rsquo;s from                  Canada? We know we&rsquo;ve got a couple people from Canada;                  maybe you&rsquo;re shy or maybe you&rsquo;re late, but you&rsquo;ve                  paid. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">Croatia? Okay, wonderful. The Czech Republic? Denmark? Okay.                  Ecuador. </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; Hey! [applause &amp; laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; France? Great Britain? A lot of people from Germany,                  I think. Israel? Italy? Luxembourg? Malta? We&rsquo;ve got                  a large contingent from the Netherlands. </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; Wow! [applause] </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small country full of very smart                  people, just like the Swiss. [laughter] Okay, Norway? Poland?                  Portugal? Slovakia? Slovenia? Spain? Sweden? Switzerland? Alright&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; It feels like the Eurovision Song Contest. </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; Eurovision Song Contest. [laughter] Absolutely,                  yes! </p>                <p class="style7">And&hellip; the USA. [applause] We were going to have somebody                  in America, actually living in China, he was going to come.                  Some strange things have happened to some of the people who&rsquo;ve                  been intending to come to this conference. Now, we&rsquo;re                  not going to ask anyone to share any details here, but I bet                  that there are some people here who had to overcome some last-minute                  problems to get here. </p>                <p class="style7">The guy from China couldn&rsquo;t make it, because his son                  had been kidnapped by his ex-wife! We hope that nothing like                  that happened to you guys, but we&rsquo;ve had our fair share                  of interesting incidents. </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; Oh, yeah. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; Okay. George Green coined this phrase &ldquo;The                  Ground Crew&rdquo; and there&rsquo;s a wonderful little book                  -- it&rsquo;s a free eBook -- which is available on his website.                  Actually, it&rsquo;s a series of four books and the fourth                  book is called <em>Messages For The Ground Crew. </em>I highly                  recommend that you read this. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s a little book that George tells a very interesting                  story that it&rsquo;s basically a channeled book; he didn&rsquo;t                  write it, it just came through his fingers. This was a message                  basically from a group who he identified as the Pleiadians.                  The message in this book was that we may not have a lot of                  time to fix things up here; that the Earth is in trouble, the                  human race is in trouble. </p>                <p class="style7">The story doesn&rsquo;t have to have an unhappy ending, but                  there&rsquo;s quite a lot of work to do and someone&rsquo;s                  got to do it. This book, this little book, the <em>Messages                  For The Ground Crew</em>, was like a calling to people who                  considered themselves to be the people who were going to do                  the work if nobody else did. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s a very interesting situation, because I&rsquo;m                  quite sure that a lot of people in this room -- maybe everyone                  in this room -- you might not actually consider yourself to                  be a totally normal human being. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I&rsquo;m not going to ask you to hold up your hands                  and admit to being really strange, but I&rsquo;ll try the opposite.                  Is anyone willing to hold up their hand and think that they&rsquo;re                  really normal? [laughter] We have two people. Maybe you&rsquo;re                  in the wrong conference. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m quite sure that there are a lot of people here who                  believe, or who know, or have recalled, or are recalling that                  they&rsquo;re here this lifetime for a purpose. My friend and                  colleague, Kerry Cassidy, is organizing a conference in Los                  Angeles in September and the title of that conference is <em>Awake                  and Aware</em>. That was her idea, and it&rsquo;s a pretty                  good title, I wish I&rsquo;d thought of it. </p>                <p class="style7">But there are a lot of people here who are awake and aware. </p>                <p class="style7">Two weekends ago, we had the great pleasure and privilege &ndash; it                  was an extraordinary weekend, actually &ndash; of meeting somebody                  called Dr. Pete Peterson. I&rsquo;ll say a little bit about                  that here, then more in my workshop on Sunday morning. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the many things that Pete Peterson told us was that,                  as far as his research had led him to understand, 15 percent                  of humans had extraterrestrial DNA that could be directly identified.                  The same man told us, because of some things that he has a                  lot of experience of in his career, that those same fifteen                  percent are resistant to being mind controlled. </p>                <p class="style7">The implications of this are very, very interesting. It implies                  that it may be quite hard to wake up 85 percent of the population.                  This is across all races and nationalities. But the 15 percent                  are waking up and I think that everyone in this room is going                  to be part of that group. </p>                <p class="style7">As I kind of put these pieces together, this                  is really what this grouping called the <em>Ground Crew</em> are,                  or may be. It&rsquo;s not just a grass roots movement. [to                  Ruth] Do you know what I mean by 'grass roots'? </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; Not really. </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; Not just in the public, it&rsquo;s not just a                  public movement by the person in the street, the ordinary person.                  There are people on the inside. There are people on the inside                  of the military of the intelligence services, even in politics. </p>                <p class="style7">Military intelligence and politics, and these are good guys                  as well. There are quite a lot of them. We&rsquo;ve met some                  of them, and they&rsquo;re doing what they can from the inside                  to change things. </p>                <p class="style7">What this conference is about &ndash; well, let me start that                  sentence again. One of the things this conference is about;                  it&rsquo;s helping to form what Rupert Sheldrake called a <em>morphic                  field</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">Or, to change the metaphor, we&rsquo;re trying to create a                  wave, or we&rsquo;re trying to get a snowball rolling. And                  we&rsquo;re not alone in here because we know that a lot of                  you guys are doing everything that you can in your own countries,                  in your own ways. </p>                <p class="style7">There is a real movement here, there&rsquo;s a real awakening,                  a lot of people becoming more aware. A lot of people are talking                  about it. Almost all of you will be on the Internet a lot and                  it&rsquo;s being talked about and this is a real phenomenon. </p>                <p class="style7">David Icke is talking about it; David Icke was one of the                  first people to really start shaking people awake back in the                  early 1990s. </p>                <p class="style7">In the early 1990s, David Icke was talking about what David                  Wilcock calls <em>Illuminati politics.</em> He felt that his                  mission was to talk about a lot of startling and incredible                  information about what really is happening in the world. We                  had the privilege of talking with him in February of this year,                  personally, and what he wanted to talk about then was the role                  of consciousness. </p>                <p class="style7">And this is really the theme of this conference, although                  there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting stuff that we can talk about.                  We can talk about Illuminati politics and we can talk about                  high technology, too. There&rsquo;s a lot of very interesting                  stuff. We may have somebody in this room who&rsquo;s been off-planet,                  for example, and I&rsquo;m not going to ask them to raise their                  hand unless they want to. [laughter] It&rsquo;s not him. </p>                <p class="style7">There is a lot of &ndash; in English, we use the euphemism &ndash; there&rsquo;re                  a lot of <em>sexy</em> things we could talk about. But what                  we really want to talk about is the important stuff, and the                  important stuff is how we can all work together to create a                  better world. </p>                <p class="style7">Hence, the title of this conference, which is: <em>A New World,                    If You Can Take It</em>. And I didn&rsquo;t think of that                    title either. Some of you probably know that this came from                    Colonel Philip Corso. He&rsquo;s now passed on but he wrote                    a very significant book called <em>The Day After Roswell</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">The story of how that phrase came into prominence is best                  told by his son. </p>                <p class="style7">What his son explained was that in 1957 his father was in                  White Sands Missile Base in New Mexico. He encountered a disc                  and a being in the desert. It was sitting there in the desert                  and it was sort of phasing in and out of his field of vision;                  it was a very strange phenomenon. </p>                <p class="style7">He was very shocked, and as he looked at this being, this                  being contacted him telepathically. The being asked him if                  he could go back to the central operations base at White Sands                  and turn off the radar. As many of you may know, there&rsquo;s                  a lot of evidence that one of the reasons why the discs crashed                  in the late 1940s and early 1950s was because of the high-powered                  radar that was being used. </p>                <p class="style7">So this little ET asked Philip Corso to turn off the radar                  so that he could get out of here and go. And Philip Corso asked                  the question: <em>Well, if I help you, what&rsquo;s &ndash; </em>in                  English we say &ndash; <em>what&rsquo;s in it for me? What                  do I get out of this?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">This little extraterrestrial - or whatever he was - said: <em>A                    new world if you can take it.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So this phrase didn&rsquo;t come from a human being or, if                  it was a time traveler, it didn&rsquo;t come from a human being                  from this time. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the reasons why I love this phrase &ndash; a new world,                  if you can take it &ndash; is that, in English, it has a double                  meaning. In English it can mean two things. It can mean: <em>a                  new world, if you can handle it</em>, and the other meaning                  is: <em>it&rsquo;s a new world that&rsquo;s there for you to                  take it, if you want to. </em> </p>                <p class="style7">Like reaching up for something on a high shelf in a supermarket,                  you can take it. In other words, it&rsquo;s available <em>if                  we want it.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">This, also, is what this conference is about, because it&rsquo;s                  about what kind of future is waiting for us. And even that                  isn&rsquo;t an accurate use of words. The really accurate way                  of putting it is: <em>What future will we create for ourselves?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">We get into all kinds of paradoxes here because there is strong                  evidence - and you will hear much more about this this evening                  when we hear from Dan Burisch - the strong evidence that we                  have been visited by future humans; human beings from the future                  who have returned to try and help and give us some valuable                  information. </p>                <p class="style7">Even that is not a proper use of words, because just now I                  said <em>they&rsquo;re from the future.</em> But more accurate                  would be to say <em>they&rsquo;re from &ldquo;a&rdquo; future</em>.                  There&rsquo;s a lot of evidence that we have a choice of futures.                  There are alternative futures. There are different ways in                  which this whole virtual reality game which we&rsquo;re in,                  this movie which we&rsquo;re all playing in, could actually                  end. </p>                <p class="style7">It doesn&rsquo;t actually <em>end</em>, but we get the idea.                  [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">Another metaphor would be, it&rsquo;s like: which path do                  we want to take? And one of the things that Dan is going to                  talk about this evening with Marci McDowell is how it may be                  that there is good news; there is encouraging news, about the                  fact that, maybe, things aren&rsquo;t going to be as bad as                  we thought. </p>                <p class="style7">Now this is incredible information. When I say <em>incredible</em>,                  I mean it in the literal meaning of the word, it is &ldquo;not                  believable&rdquo;. </p>                <p class="style7">We know that this information is hard to believe. We know                  that Dan Burisch is hard to believe. We have people writing                  to us every day saying that Dan Burisch is hard to believe                  and I agree with them. But there&rsquo;s something very important                  here that we ask you, and that is that, if you are in doubt                  about this story, we ask you to suspend your disbelief. We                  ask you not to disbelieve until you hear the evidence. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time with this man; it&rsquo;s been                  a great privilege for me to do so. The most recent time I spent                  with him was several hours in a car yesterday. We went off                  to look at the Swiss countryside and we ended up having another                  conversation about his experiences. And he talked about them                  in great detail on the video that we recorded with David Wilcock                  late last night. I will stake my reputation on the fact that                  this man is telling the truth. </p>                <p class="style7">David Wilcock - who many of you have also come here specifically                  to hear - has also been in close touch with Dan since 2003.                  David is sure that this story is true. </p>                <p class="style7">From my personal point of view, the story goes right back                  to the beginning of Project Camelot, just over three years                  ago. It feels like a very long time ago, but I guess it really                  isn&rsquo;t a long time compared with the many years that many                  UFO researchers have been working. </p>                <p class="style7">I had only just met Kerry and we just had this wild idea that                  we could assist and continue the work of the Disclosure Project,                  which we admired, just by talking to people and helping them                  get the information out about what they&rsquo;d experienced.                  Because, like many of you, I&rsquo;m sure, both Kerry and I                  had been inspired by the work of Steven Greer when he brought                  out a number of witnesses to the Washington Press Club conference;                  I think it was in May of 2001. </p>                <p class="style7">We admire the work of Steven Greer. We&rsquo;ve never met                  him, but we&rsquo;re both going to be at the Exopolitics Conference                  in Spain, which is in a couple of weekends time, and we have                  an arrangement to talk to Steven Greer then, which will be                  a lot of fun. </p>                <p class="style7">Anyway, in those days, just like many of you &ndash; you&rsquo;ve                  got blogs, you&rsquo;ve got web sites, some of you are journalists;                  you&rsquo;re doing everything you can do to try to get this                  information out. This is a big team effort all over the world.                  We just picked up this little camcorder that Kerry had - you                  could fit it in your pocket, it was tiny - and we just started                  talking to people. We were amateurs. </p>                <p class="style7">In fact, I&rsquo;ll tell you a joke about this, which is really                  true. One of the favorite messages that I ever got in an email                  was from somebody last year who wrote to me and said: <em>You                  know, for many months, I thought that you must be working for                  the CIA. </em>Then he said: <em>I finally realized that you                  couldn&rsquo;t be, otherwise your videos would be a lot more                  professional. </em>[laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">I took that as a compliment; I thought it was very funny.                  It&rsquo;s what Kerry Cassidy calls <em>guerilla film making</em>.                  [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">So we were just doing our thing and we had the opportunity &ndash; it&rsquo;s                  a wonderful opportunity &ndash; to meet Dan Burisch, and we                  were introduced by Bill Hamilton. We were as enthusiastic to                  meet Dan as probably many of you are, and we know this is why                  you&rsquo;re here. </p>                <p class="style7">I personally have been interested in his story since 2002                  and, when we met Dan for the very first time, within ten minutes,                  I realized that this was an exceptional man. He was smart,                  he was humble, he was funny, he was aware and he was completely                  committed to doing the job that he had been <em>told</em> to                  do, of releasing this information. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that he is going to do this evening, when                  he&rsquo;s presenting on this platform, is he will play you                  the recording of when he was given his orders to release this                  information. Because what Dan is doing is actually part of                  an unofficial &ndash; no, let me say this again &ndash; it&rsquo;s                  part of an official disclosure program with built-in plausible                  deniability. </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; Will you explain this a little more? </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; Absolutely. He was ordered to tell this unbelievable                  story of everything that he knew and everything that he experienced.                  The person who ordered him was the previous MJ-1 in the Majestic                  12 group, and this is John Mike McConnell who, after he stepped                  down from that role in Majestic, became the Director of National                  Intelligence in the U.S. &ndash; the DNI. In other words, he&rsquo;s                  the guy who is the boss of the head of the NSA. He&rsquo;s                  the top dog. </p>                <p class="style7">Dan will say a lot more this evening about Mike McConnell                  and his relationship with Mike McConnell. The unenviable position                  that Dan is in is that, if we were to go and find Mike McConnell                  and say: <em>Well, what do you think of this story? </em>He                  would say: <em>This man is obviously crazy.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So they&rsquo;re using Dan to disseminate this information                  into, I guess, those 15 percent of people who are awake and                  aware. Dan will tell you this evening what a tough job that                  has been. And he&rsquo;ll tell you about his reaction when                  he first received those orders, which were in October 2005. </p>                <p class="style7">And then along came Project Camelot. </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; Will you tell about this reaction now? </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; No, that&rsquo;s for Dan. I mean, that&rsquo;s                  Dan&rsquo;s story. I&rsquo;m just preparing the ground. </p>                <p class="style7">But&hellip; along came Project Camelot. We had no idea what                  we were getting ourselves into but, after meeting Dan, it was                  so obvious to us that this man had high integrity and the best                  of intentions that we, then, became an unknowing part of this <em>unofficial</em> disclosure                  movement. </p>                <p class="style7">When I asked Dan &ndash; ah, this is really quite funny. We                  met Dan for dinner, Kerry Cassidy and myself, at the beginning                  of last year, about 18 months ago, and I said to him: <em>You                  know, it&rsquo;s amazing, because we&rsquo;re hiding out in                  the open. Everyone knows who I am; I make it obvious who I                  am; everyone knows my name; I don&rsquo;t try and hide.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">If the intelligence agencies wanted to stop what we were doing,                  they could do it really easily. Every now and then we get a                  little bit of trouble, but, basically, we&rsquo;re being allowed                  to do what we do. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m not really claiming anything too special here, because                  those of you with blogs and web sites, and those of you who                  are journalists and film makers here in this room, no one&rsquo;s                  really trying to stop you, either. Not really. </p>                <p class="style7">They could really have just squashed us like flies if they&rsquo;d                  wanted to, and they haven&rsquo;t done that. So I asked Dan,                  I said: <em>Is it possible that Mike McConnell, in his role                  of Director of National Intelligence, could be protecting us?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Dan fixed me with a very twinkling eye &ndash; Dan has a very                  expressive face &ndash; and he said: <em>If he was, you would                  never know about it, would you?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So that&rsquo;s my answer &ndash; he answered my question &ndash; that                  we are being allowed to do what we do, because the governments                  and the intelligence agencies and the military of this world                  -- they have a problem. As we say in English, they&rsquo;re                  in over their heads; they have a huge problem. Many of you                  will know how they&rsquo;ve been trying to handle this problem                  for many, many years to get this information out without causing                  social disruption, panic, or too much personal shock for people. </p>                <p class="style7">A couple of years ago I had a very interesting conversation                  with Dr. Hal Puthoff, the famous physicist, the director of                  the Institute of Advanced Studies in Austin, Texas. It&rsquo;s                  one of my personal goals to interview him on Project Camelot,                  by the way. </p>                <p class="style7">It was Hal who explained to me &ndash; and he&rsquo;s a very                  intelligent guy, he&rsquo;s a very nice guy, I&rsquo;m privileged                  to count him as a friend as well &ndash; and he said that what&rsquo;s                  important -- and he was sort of giving me advice, rather like                  an uncle -- he said: <em>Don&rsquo;t try and prove anything;                  because, if you come out with documents and photographs, things                  that cannot be denied, then people will go into shock because                  their reality will be challenged.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">If all we&rsquo;re doing is: we&rsquo;re telling crazy stories                  about time travel and future humans and all this wild high                  technology, but we can&rsquo;t prove anything, then the 15                  percent of the awake and aware people will say: <em>Okay, I                  thought it was like that and thanks for confirming it.</em> And                  the others guys will say <em>we&rsquo;re all crazy</em> and                  they&rsquo;ll carry on, watching TV and going to church on                  Sunday morning. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">So one of the factors in Project Camelot that has enabled                  us to continue operating is that we don&rsquo;t present proof;                  we don&rsquo;t have any proof. But what we do have is a lot                  of consistent stories. And, after we met Dan Burisch in - I                  think it was July&hellip; I think it was this month in 2006,                  I actually can&rsquo;t remember &ndash; and we got on video                  this wild story.&nbsp; And for those of you who are still not                  quite clear about this story, I will just give you the summary                  version right now. </p>                <p class="style7">That story is that at least some of the so-called extraterrestrials                  are actually not just visitors from other planets, but they                  are time travelers from other times. Not only are they visitors                  from other times, but they&rsquo;re <em>human beings</em> from                  a future time; from several different times in the future,                  but all on this same timeline. </p>                <p class="style7">A whole variety of very strange things happened that caused                  a huge amount of complexity and entanglement of the timeline.                  But, the essence of what the future humans wanted to communicate                  was that, in their history, there was a catastrophe. It happened                  round about now and the cause of this catastrophe was connected                  with the passage of the solar system through a region of energized                  space. </p>                <p class="style7">Again, this is condensed and not intended to be fully, technically                  accurate, because the realities are very complicated, but one                  of the secret high-tech devices that some of the governments                  in the world had was called <em>The Looking Glass</em>. The                  Looking Glass is a way of gathering information from different                  times. It&rsquo;s a sort of portal; it&rsquo;s a window; you                  can look through it, or into it, and you can retrieve information                  from the future. </p>                <p class="style7">To make that story even more incredible, this wasn&rsquo;t                  given to us by visiting extraterrestrials; this was back-engineered                  from Sumerian cylinder seals. Anyone who knows about the work                  of Zecharia Sitchin will understand that the Sumerians received                  their civilization and their technical knowledge from the Anunnaki. </p>                <p class="style7">So, as I understand it, the Looking Glass is Anunnaki technology,                  which is being used by the American government as a really                  useful way of looking ahead to see what was going to happen                  -- with all the attendant paradoxes and complexities that went                  along with that. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that Dan told us was that many politicians                  - not just American politicians - had been told what had been                  seen for them in the future. And, as long as they liked what                  they saw, then they just acted out the role just like actors                  in a movie, because they knew what it was that they were meant                  to be doing. </p>                <p class="style7">Something that Dan said that added further complexity to this                  story was that the Roswell crash was also a visit from time-traveling                  future humans and that that was a genuine accident. One of                  the immediate problems that resulted from that was that, in                  the late 1940s, the Americans were experimenting with time-travel                  technology that they did not understand. If you start experimenting                  with technology like that, and you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re                  doing, you&rsquo;re going to get yourself in a real mess. </p>                <p class="style7">A part of that is something that David Wilcock, who&rsquo;s                  just joined us in this room &ndash; David, nice to see you                  [applause] &ndash; David&rsquo;s talking for much of the day                  tomorrow and one of the things that he may or may not refer                  to is that a number of years ago, he was sitting in a restaurant,                  occupying himself by reading one of Peter Moon&rsquo;s books                  about the Montauk Project. </p>                <p class="style7">At that time, David thought that the Montauk Project was a                  pretty crazy story and was very unlikely to be true. And this                  other guy was over at this other table in this restaurant and                  saw him reading the book. He came over to David and said: <em>Do                  you mind if I join you? </em>He said: <em>What do you think                  of that book? </em>David said: <em>It&rsquo;s a crazy story;                  I&rsquo;ve got nothing else to read right now.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">If I&rsquo;m misrepresenting this story, David, I apologize,                  but this is the essence of it. </p>                <p class="style7">David Wilcock:&nbsp; I actually told him                  it was <em>bullshit</em>.                  [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; David doesn&rsquo;t pull any punches. This guy                  came over to David and said:<em> Well, actually, maybe it&rsquo;s                  not just bullshit, because I can tell you some things about                  this story.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">This was somebody who David then got to know over a period                  of quite a long time really very well, and he called him <em>Daniel</em>,                  which is not his real name. Daniel said that at least the first                  of Peter Moon&rsquo;s series of Montauk books was essentially                  quite true. And David&rsquo;s a pretty smart guy, so actually,                  he started listening. But he never published any of that information;                  he kept it to himself. </p>                <p class="style7">This is where these different testimonies start to come together.                  Because, after we had personally heard this story from Dan                  Burisch, we then met a guy who we have given the pseudonym                  to, of <em>Henry Deacon</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">Many people think that these people we bump into, that, somehow,                  they&rsquo;ve been planted, or it&rsquo;s all been engineered,                  or it&rsquo;s all been choreographed in some way. But, rather                  like David meeting Daniel in the restaurant, our meeting Henry                  really was quite an accident. </p>                <p class="style7">When Kerry and I met Henry for the first time, it was in a                  very noisy Pizza Hut. The first thing Henry did was, he took                  out his cell phone, put it on the table and took out the battery,                  because cell phones can be used as listening devices, even                  if they&rsquo;re turned off. And Henry started talking about                  an enormous amount of fascinating information that included                  the mention of time travel and Montauk. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I&rsquo;m English and I&rsquo;m not quite so expressive                  as David is, so I didn&rsquo;t actually use the word <em>bullshit</em>,                  but I was very surprised, and I said: <em>Are you saying that                  the Montauk project is real?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Henry said that we shouldn&rsquo;t call it <em>the Montauk                    project</em>; there were Montauk projects &ndash; in the                    plural &ndash; and that the Americans have been messing around                    with time-travel technology for many, many years and had                    created all kinds of paradoxes and problems. And every time                    they tried to fix it, they made it worse. </p>                <p class="style7">I asked Henry if he&rsquo;d heard of Dan Burisch&rsquo;s story,                  because I immediately thought that there must be a correlation                  here and Henry had not heard of Dan. So we said: <em>Well look,                  this sounds like the same sort of stuff. Watch our video and                  do get back to us because we&rsquo;d love to know what you                  think.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Three weeks later, Henry got back to us and he said: <em>I                    can confirm Dan Burisch&rsquo;s story, timelines and all.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">That really made us sit up and take notice of this stuff.                  Intuitively, we had strongly felt that this was the heart of                  the problem, but it was very valuable to have this coming at                  us from two different sources, who we&rsquo;d met and spent                  time with personally. </p>                <p class="style7">After we published this information from Henry on our web                  site, then David Wilcock contacted us, and we hadn&rsquo;t                  previously been in contact with him at all. David said: <em>This                  information is really important, because it&rsquo;s the first                  confirmation I have heard of what my source, Daniel, told me,                  which I have never published.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Then we met David and we did an interview with him. </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; That was the first meeting with David? </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; Yes, that was the first meeting with David. </p>                <p class="style7">David told us a lot of the stuff that Daniel had shared with                  him during the time that they&rsquo;d spent together. </p>                <p class="style7">Therefore, what I want to say is like an adapted version of                  something that Bill Cooper said &ndash; William Cooper, very                  well known to many of you -- he said this back at the end of                  the 1980s. What Bill Cooper said in a very famous lecture,                  which is still available on the Internet, he said: <em>You                  cannot make sense of geopolitics in the world without including                  the UFO/extraterrestrial issue. </em>He said: <em>You have                  to understand that stuff and accept its reality in order to                  understand what&rsquo;s happening in the world. </em> </p>                <p class="style7">I can take that one step further, because you can&rsquo;t                  make sense of the UFO/extraterrestrial question without accepting                  and taking into account time travel. It&rsquo;s deeply connected                  with many of the problems that we currently face. And while                  talking about the technicalities of time travel and all of                  the extraordinary stories &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m                  planning to do here and it&rsquo;s not actually what this conference                  is about &ndash; we can&rsquo;t talk about the future without                  talking about time. </p>                <p class="style7">Over and over and over again there are hundreds -- if not                  tens of thousands -- of accounts from people who have had contact                  with ETs, saying that there&rsquo;s a very important time for                  us all &lsquo;round about now. Some of these &ndash; let me                  call them <em>visitors</em> &ndash; some of these visitors                  have said to the people that they&rsquo;ve been communicating                  with: <em>You&rsquo;re in a lot of trouble.</em> Not them personally                  -- they&rsquo;re talking about the human race. </p>                <p class="style7">Some of them have talked about some pretty unpleasant possibilities                  that might be in front of us, like warnings. Others have said                  that there&rsquo;s the possibility of a golden, wonderful future                  for the human race. And one of the things that this conference                  is about; it&rsquo;s about presenting <em>this is a choice                  for all of us.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that I&rsquo;d like to play just before                  the break, which is happening in five minutes &ndash; do we                  have intention to play the audio? In a moment - only when I                  say <em>play</em> - I want to play an audio clip that&rsquo;s                  a one-minute audio clip. It&rsquo;s nothing especially secret,                  but it&rsquo;s very interesting and important, in my personal                  view. </p>                <p class="style7">This is an audio clip of Bill Birnes. This was before he became                  famous on <em>UFO Hunters</em>. But Bill Birnes is the editor                  of the American <em>UFO Magazine</em>. He&rsquo;s done a lot                  of research for many, many years; was the person who worked                  with Colonel Philip Corso to write the book <em>The Day After                  Roswell.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">He was on the American radio program <em>Coast to Coast AM</em> talking                  to George Noory and George Noory was asking Bill Birnes about                  the Roswell crash. What you will hear &ndash; I&rsquo;m not                  going to translate what he says; this is why I&rsquo;m giving                  you the overview here through Ruth &ndash; he said that he                  had spent some time talking with Admiral George Hoover from                  the Office of Naval Intelligence and George Hoover had told                  Bill Birnes that the Roswell visitors were time-travelers. </p>                <p class="style7">The biggest secret wasn&rsquo;t the high technology that was                  discovered; the biggest secret wasn&rsquo;t that these guys                  came from a future time; the biggest secret was that, in order                  for this time-travel to be possible, the visitors had to interface                  with their craft with their consciousness; that the real meaning                  for us in this was that we were more able and our consciousness                  was greater, than we had ever been permitted to understand;                  that the controllers of this planet don&rsquo;t want you to                  know how powerful you are, because they&rsquo;d be in big trouble                  if everyone knew how powerful they were. </p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s why they lie to us all the time to try and convince                  us that we&rsquo;re not powerful. </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;re just coming up to the break and before the break                  I just want to play &ndash; this is the clip: </p>                <p class="style7"><em>George Noory:&nbsp; What we don&rsquo;t [know] about the                    situation at Roswell is whether these were extraterrestrial,                    whether they came from a hollow Earth, whether they came                    from another dimension? We don&rsquo;t know this, right?</em> </p>                <p class="style7"><em>Bill Birnes:&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t. The only clue that                    I had was from this Naval Officer, he was from the Office                    of Naval Intelligence &ndash; ONI &ndash; called George Hoover                    (we&rsquo;ve talked about him before), who said that he was the                    Corso of the Navy [Ed Note: reference to                    Col. Philip Corso, the author of &lsquo;The Day after Roswell&rsquo;] and                    that the military believed, and he said he knew, that these                    entities were not so much interplanetary, but they were literally                    time-travelers. </em> </p>                <p class="style7"><em>And the big secret is that they were us, from the future,                    and that we and they have the same powers and that was the                    real fear of the government, that we had the ability to manipulate                    reality around us. We&rsquo;ve always had that ability. We                    just didn&rsquo;t know how to use it. And if we ever learned                    how to use it -- and were not ready for it -- we would cause                    chaos and that was the big secret that the Navy eventually                    found out.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; Thank you. So, one of the things that I want to                  pass on to my colleagues &ndash; first Dan and then David,                  who&rsquo;s to be talking about these, and closely connected                  subjects, all tomorrow &ndash; is how powerful we are and what                  opportunity we have to, in Bill Birnes&rsquo;s words: <em>to                  manipulate reality around us</em>. </p>                <p class="style7"><em>Manipulate</em> is like a strong word to use, but what                  he&rsquo;s talking about is creating reality. What reality                  we want to create and what are the opportunities are before                  us &ndash; this is what this conference is about. </p>                <p class="style7">So now we&rsquo;ll take a break and we&rsquo;ll be back here                  at half-past three and then I&rsquo;ll be talking for one more                  hour, until half past four, and then we have a two-hour break                  after that. </p>                <p class="style7">[applause] </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; All right. Very good.&nbsp; Thank you. I&rsquo;ve                  got a couple of announcements here, just minor administrative                  ones. One is just a reminder that in the little snack bar opposite                  here, which is timed to be open during the breaks, there actually                  is hot food there, if you need it or want it. </p>                <p class="style7">Another little plug here for the girls at the help desk: They                  are more than happy to help you with any problems that you&rsquo;ve                  got, including finding a hotel, answering questions about how                  to find out information and so on. Please use them. </p>                <p class="style7">And we have a couple of badges that we need to give to Heinrich                  Schnorf, and somebody who prefers to be known only as Melvin. <br>                  Okay. So, just a reminder of the timing here: I&rsquo;m going                  to talk for an hour and then we have a break until six-thirty.                  Then, at six-thirty, Dan and Marcie are going to come in and                  we&rsquo;re going to be having a conversational presentation.                  I&rsquo;m going to kind of be talking with them about their                  material. </p>                <p class="style7">I would love to know if Dan and Marcie are in the room. Are                  they here? No. Okay. They&rsquo;re still on Los Angeles time.                  [laughter] Okay. So, in this next hour, I&rsquo;m going to                  continue to prepare the ground for the main presentations by                  the other speakers. </p>                <p class="style7">Earlier I was talking about the testimony that Dan Burisch                  has been ordered to report about, which is that the time-traveling                  future humans were warning of a catastrophe &lsquo;round about                  now. I think I hadn&rsquo;t quite finished off telling the                  story of the significance of the Looking Glass devices. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the problems in telling these stories is that they                  don&rsquo;t go in a straight line. Everything you talk about                  leads to at least two or three other subjects; therefore, it&rsquo;s                  very hard to explore all this ground in a kind of linear way. </p>                <p class="style7">The significance of the Looking Glasses which, if you remember,                  I was explaining that they were back-engineered from Anunnaki                  technology through the Sumerian cylinder seals and was part                  of the creation of this huge tangle, which has got to do with                  interlocking and overlapping timelines. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that Dan will talk about this evening is                  how the Earth and the solar system are entering a region of                  energetic space. And what happened in the future humans&rsquo; history,                  was that the Looking Glasses amplified the energy from the                  energetic space and this caused a pole shift. </p>                <p class="style7">In my personal opinion &ndash; and it is a personal opinion &ndash; one                  of the reasons why&hellip; it&rsquo;s almost like there has                  evolved a modern mythology about the pole shift in 2012. The                  stories and reports and rumors about this have been surfacing                  all over the Internet and not all of this is because of what                  Dan Burisch has said. It&rsquo;s almost as if there&rsquo;s                  a kind of awareness that we all have - maybe unconsciously                  - that there&rsquo;s something &lsquo;round about now that&rsquo;s                  really quite important. </p>                <p class="style7">Clif High from <em>Half Past Human</em>, who uses linguistic                  patterns on the Internet to predict the future, says that he&rsquo;s                  able to use this linguistic analysis from the Internet because                  all humans are psychic, at least to some degree, even if they                  don&rsquo;t know it. </p>                <p class="style7">A lot of people sort of know that there&rsquo;s something                  happening &lsquo;round about now; a lot of people feel that                  these are special times and maybe dangerous times. Sometimes                  people write to us at Project Camelot to accuse us of being                  depressing, and we&rsquo;re forecasting doom, and we&rsquo;re                  telling everybody bad news. We&rsquo;re not doing that; this                  is not our intention. </p>                <p class="style7">If you want to travel to a particular destination using a                  map, you have to know where you are, so that you can make the                  journey. If you don&rsquo;t know where you are and you try                  and figure out a way to get to where you want to go to, you                  might end up in the wrong place. </p>                <p class="style7">Any counselors and therapists here among you will know that,                  if you&rsquo;re trying to help somebody, the first thing to                  do is to tell the truth about what&rsquo;s really happening.                  A counselor and a therapist helps the person face up to what&rsquo;s                  really happening, not because they&rsquo;re trying to make                  them depressed, but because they&rsquo;re actually trying to                  help them out of the situation. Sometimes that takes quite                  a lot of courage, but it&rsquo;s also the first step that&rsquo;s                  needed. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that we have been trying to do at Project                  Camelot &ndash; now, I don&rsquo;t think everything on our                  site is correct, it can&rsquo;t be, because some of our witnesses                  contradict each other &ndash; but we think that most of it                  is correct.&nbsp; What we are reporting on is that there are                  numerous situations, which we need to be awake to and aware                  of, in order to handle what&rsquo;s coming. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the reasons for this&hellip; it&rsquo;s not just so                  that you can get your guns and your food and your gold and                  then just go and hide somewhere, it&rsquo;s not just about                  that. That might not even be the smart thing to do, or the                  best thing to do, but many of you really understand that there&rsquo;s                  more going on here, as we say in English, more going on than                  meets the eye; more going on than we can see. </p>                <p class="style7">This is spiritual; it&rsquo;s a spiritual game &ndash; and                  when I use the word <em>game</em>, I&rsquo;m not implying that                  anything is trivial &ndash; but it&rsquo;s a game in the sense                  that, if we play it right, then we can ensure a good outcome.                  And we may have opponents in this game. Something that&rsquo;s                  very clear to me -- and I know that it&rsquo;s very clear to                  many of you -- is that, really, this is a spiritual game. </p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t really want to use the word <em>spiritual war</em> because                  that&rsquo;s a kind of contradiction; there&rsquo;s nothing                  spiritual about a war. One of the things that&rsquo;s very                  clear to me is that it&rsquo;s about &ndash; how can I use                  the words &ndash; it&rsquo;s about resolving spiritual problems.                  One of the reasons why a lot of us are here -- I would suggest                  -- on this planet is because this is where a lot of the problems                  are showing up; this is where a lot of the problems are visible. </p>                <p class="style7">There are certain things that people can do; some of you may                  very well be active in this area, which is helping to resolve                  things at a spiritual level. In order to resolve problems spiritually,                  you&rsquo;ve got to know what the problems are -- so one of                  the things that Project Camelot has been doing is bringing                  situations to the awareness of people who are able to operate                  on a spiritual level to help resolve them. </p>                <p class="style7">So we&rsquo;re actually operating on multiple levels here.                  You can go and grab your guns and your food and your gold and                  go and hide, if you want to, but that&rsquo;s not actually                  what we&rsquo;re recommending. I&rsquo;m just saying that as                  a kind of joke, but I want to just use the next 45 minutes                  to lay out some of the potential situations that we may have                  in front of us. </p>                <p class="style7">Before I even start, I want to stress that most of these things                  haven&rsquo;t happened yet, and they may not happen at all. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that Henry Deacon told us when we first                  met him, he said the problems are complex because everything                  is happening at once; there&rsquo;s a convergence of problems.                  Some of the problems may be connected with Earth changes and                  the region of space which the solar system is moving through. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that David Wilcock may talk about tomorrow &ndash; he&rsquo;s                  done a lot of research in this area &ndash; is how global warming                  has got nothing to do, well, very little to do, with burning                  fossil fuels. Everything in the solar system is heating up                  as it moves into this region of space. </p>                <p class="style7">With this sort of energetic influence, it seems that there                  also comes an opportunity. One of the things that David will                  talk about is how the very same influences that may be causing                  global warming are also assisting with the process of a change                  in consciousness. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m saying <em>assisting</em> with the change in consciousness,                  because I think that our own personal development has got something                  to do with this as well, but the circumstances may be making                  this more easy to happen; may be allowing it to happen. So                  that&rsquo;s a factor as well; the fact that, as we enter into                  this region that may present dangers and threats, everyone&rsquo;s                  waking up at the same time. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things here &ndash; this is something else that,                  personally, I was alerted to by Henry Deacon &ndash; was the                  influence of magnetic pole reversal, or changes in the Earth&rsquo;s                  magnetic field. Because, whether we&rsquo;re aware of it or                  not, as human beings, our nervous systems and our brains work                  electrically and, although we can&rsquo;t see it, we&rsquo;re                  sort of swimming around in this electromagnetic ocean all the                  time. </p>                <p class="style7">And human beings are very sensitive. If you start messing                  around with the electromagnetics around a human being, then                  their behavior and their emotions and their attitude is likely                  to be affected as well. </p>                <p class="style7">So I wonder how many people in this room have noticed that                  every now and then, there are people around them that seem                  to be behaving irrationally, at least to some small degree;                  maybe they&rsquo;re becoming a little more unstable, sometimes;                  maybe there are more disagreements, more quarrels; maybe some                  people, who you thought were very, very level-headed, are making                  some strange errors of judgment. </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s a sort of instability, which is something that                  Kerry Cassidy and myself started to notice about a year ago;                  we just noticed a lot of anomalous events with peoples&rsquo; behavior.                  We started thinking <em>there&rsquo;s something very strange                  happening here; this is a pattern</em>. And a lot of people                  have been commenting on this all over the Internet, entirely                  independently of anything we&rsquo;ve been saying. </p>                <p class="style7">This is another factor to take into account, the fact that                  people might not be responding to situations in the way that                  they always used to, maybe not as predictably, maybe not as                  stably. </p>                <p class="style7">On top of all of that, there is what David Wilcock refers                  to as &ldquo;Illuminati politics&rdquo;, which is a phrase                  that I love. What that refers to -- that beautiful, little                  phrase -- it just refers to whatever the agenda of people who                  consider themselves to be in control of planet Earth, or wanting                  to be in control of planet Earth, what that agenda might be. </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; That was complicated! </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; That was complicated? </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; Yes! </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; Okay. Illuminati politics refers to the possible                  agenda of the controllers of the planet, or the people who                  might want to be the controllers of the planet. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that Henry Deacon alerted us to was a document                  called the <em>Report From Iron Mountain</em>. Now, a lot of                  people say that this is a fictional document, but Henry reports                  how, in an intelligence briefing a number of years ago, he                  was given this document, ordered to read it and then to report                  back the next morning. </p>                <p class="style7">Henry maintains it is not a fictional document. But whether                  it is or not, it certainly seems to be used as if its contents                  were a good description of what&rsquo;s happening. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the many things that the Report from Iron Mountain                  talks about &ndash; this is a document that dates back to the                  1960s &ndash; is that there are too many people in the planet.                  There is an overpopulation problem, and it is possible to argue                  that this is a real problem. </p>                <p class="style7">George Green talks about the <em>Global 2000 Report</em>,                  which also talks about the need to reduce the world&rsquo;s                  population in order for the planet, basically, to survive.                  Anyone whose seen, or seen photographs of, the <em>Georgia                  Guidestones</em> in America, in Georgia, one of the things                  that&rsquo;s on the Georgia Guidestones is a very clear, plain                  statement that the goal is to have five hundred million people                  on the planet, which is something like a 90 to 95 percent reduction                  of the number of people now. </p>                <p class="style7">There are a couple of things to notice here. One is that it&rsquo;s                  easy to believe that this intention could exist; it&rsquo;s                  easy to understand how they might want to do it. Anyone whose                  ever been to Cairo or Lagos or Calcutta or Mexico City, there&rsquo;s                  a problem. It&rsquo;s easy to understand why the controllers                  of the planet might want to drastically reduce the world&rsquo;s                  population. But they haven&rsquo;t done this yet, or if they&rsquo;ve                  tried to do it, then they haven&rsquo;t succeeded. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that David might talk about tomorrow is                  how &ndash; let me get the wording right &ndash; how human                  beings are naturally resistant to viruses that are designed                  to wipe them all out; it just isn&rsquo;t going to happen quite                  so easily. Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there might not                  be plans to do this. Many of you will know that the outbreak                  of Swine flu from Mexico earlier this year, it almost exactly                  repeats the pattern of the 1918 Spanish flu. </p>                <p class="style7">What happened in 1918 was, &lsquo;round about February, there                  was a very mild form of flu that swept around the world. But                  it was very mild, people recovered quickly; it was called the <em>three-day                  flu. </em>A lot of people got flu for three days and then they                  recovered, and then it was the summertime of 1918. </p>                <p class="style7">Then there was another wave that started &lsquo;round about                  October, I think it was, of that year and, by that time, there                  was &ndash; it&rsquo;s what virologists call a <em>viral mass &ndash; </em>there                  was such a large quantity of this virus around in the population                  that it enabled it to mutate. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, that&rsquo;s something that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.                  This morning I looked at an American web site; it&rsquo;s called <em>flu.gov</em>.                  Now, we&rsquo;re not there yet, but there is evidence that                  the governments are preparing people, either for a real outbreak                  or for people to be <em>frightened</em> into thinking that                  there&rsquo;s a real outbreak, and to run for vaccinations                  to help them. The problem might not be the flu; it might be                  the vaccinations. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I know that you guys have been following this kind of                  stuff on the Internet and this not the purpose of this talk,                  to go into that in detail; but, it describes the kind of thing                  that they might be planning to do. It&rsquo;s a very delicate                  line to draw, because one of the ways that people are controlled                  is through fear. So it&rsquo;s very important not to be afraid                  of this stuff and it&rsquo;s also very important to know what&rsquo;s                  happening. So, once again, we have to be awake and aware of                  all of this information. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, a couple of weeks ago, we had a very significant meeting                  with Dr. Pete Peterson. We talked to him &ndash; and when I                  say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, this is Kerry Cassidy, David Wilcock                  and myself -- we all met with this guy two weeks ago.&nbsp; And                  we asked him about this problem, this situation, with the timelines                  and the time-traveling future humans and the warning of a future                  catastrophe -- and he didn&rsquo;t know about any of that;                  or he said he didn&rsquo;t know about any of it. </p>                <p class="style7">But what he did say was - and he really was very animated                  and urgent about this - he said that he was as sure as he personally                  could be that there really were plans to bring America under                  martial law. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, again, we have to draw a fine line here because I don&rsquo;t                  want to run the risk of trying to convince you all that this                  is going to happen, which means that you&rsquo;re more likely                  to create it in your own future, but he told us that he was                  as sure as he could be that there was going to be a collapse                  of the financial system and a collapse of the infrastructure                  within America towards the end of this year. The last information                  we got off of him was that this was going to be &lsquo;round                  about the beginning of October. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, if we have any more information about this, and of course,                  on Project Camelot, we&rsquo;re going to make this available                  to you; this is our duty to do that. And that really is all                  we know about that. </p>                <p class="style7">But, when David talks tomorrow, he&rsquo;s going to make a                  good case for why we shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily buy into this                  kind of plan. One of the things that David wants to talk about                  is that for years, there have been people saying: <em>this                  is going to happen</em> and <em>that&rsquo;s going to happen</em> and <em>we&rsquo;re                  all in great danger</em> -- and nothing ever really goes wrong. </p>                <p class="style7">I respect his view about that, but we still have a duty to                  report what people are telling us. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that, here in Europe, we can be reasonably                  confident of, is that, if we see something major starting to                  happen in America, then it will probably affect us in Europe                  very soon afterwards. If we can make it through to the end                  of this year -- and not a lot has gone wrong -- then I think                  that we really will be &ndash; as Dan Burisch likes to say,                  he said, the last time and the only time that he&rsquo;s been                  on stage at a conference, in Laughlin, Nevada, last year --                  he said there&rsquo;s not going to be a catastrophe, there&rsquo;s                  going to be a Golden Age. </p>                <p class="style7">And this is where we go right back to what we were talking                  about before, that there is the opportunity for us to create                  the future that we want. Just because something is planned,                  it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s going to happen. </p>                <p class="style7">Dan is going to tell us, this evening, about how he and the                  people who he is working with and reporting to, are as sure                  as they can be that, what is known as the <em>timeline two                  catastrophe</em>, the time for that has passed and it has not                  happened. We&rsquo;ve already taken that fork in the freeway,                  that fork in the autobahn, that&rsquo;s going off in a better                  direction. </p>                <p class="style7">Dan will tell us, this evening, how he discovered &ndash; or                  felt he discovered and then checked out &ndash; that the actual                  date of this catastrophe in the future humans&rsquo; history                  was the 28th of March, in this year [2009]. And that day passed                  and nothing happened. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, people who refuse to believe that story will say:<em> Well,                    of course, nothing happened because nothing was ever going                    to happen.</em> But what I invite you all to do is look at                    the man who will be here on stage with me this evening and                    assess for yourself whether he&rsquo;s telling the truth. </p>                <p class="style7">So Dan, at the moment, is a very optimistic man. He feels                  that everything is going in the right direction. Dan says that                  the dollar is not going to crash. Now, that&rsquo;s not just                  his opinion; Dan is also very well connected with people who                  know what&rsquo;s going on and who know what the plans are. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that may be happening, when we get information                  from different sources that don&rsquo;t seem to all agree,                  is that we may be hearing one plan from this direction, another                  plan from that direction, and we don&rsquo;t actually know                  which one is going to be the one that rolls out. </p>                <p class="style7">David Wilcock has something to say in the back row here. David? </p>                <p class="style7">David:&nbsp; [inaudible] </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; Absolutely, yes. </p>                <p class="style7">Ruth:&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t get it. </p>                <p class="style7">Bill:&nbsp; David&rsquo;s reminded me about something else                  that Dr. Pete Peterson told us about the end of this year.                  What Dr. Pete Peterson told us was that President Obama was                  going to reveal the reality of extraterrestrial contact before                  the end of this year. He said that he had been told this by                  people who knew that the television time on the networks had                  already been booked. The date he told us, if I remember it                  right, was November the 27th. </p>                <p class="style7">What he also told us was that it was one of these ritualistically                  significant dates, numerologically. He said that what Obama                  was going to talk about was the reality of contact with six                  different friendly ET races. When we asked him why he used                  the word <em>friendly</em>, he said: <em>Well, some of them                  are unfriendly, but most of them are friendly.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that Pete Peterson told us -- and this is                  a turn of phrase that I love to use -- is that, he said he                  quit working for the U.S. government because he didn&rsquo;t                  like feeling that he had to have three baths a day to avoid                  the feeling of being covered in excrement. Then we asked him                  why he worked for the U.S. government at all, and he said that                  a lot of his work had actually been motivated by the fact that                  they needed help, because some of the ETs were not friendly. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I don&rsquo;t pretend to know all the complexities that                  are involved here. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine that, as I was                  saying about an hour ago, that the American government and                  the other governments, they&rsquo;re literally in over their                  heads. There&rsquo;s so much going on that they really don&rsquo;t                  know how properly to handle this. </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s a huge amount of evidence that the Americans                  have been spending trillions of dollars building underground                  bases ever since the end of the Second World War. This is an                  almost unimaginably expensive, long-term construction project.                  And we&rsquo;re not even talking about the cost of the secret                  space program. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that Pete Peterson told us was that the                  Aurora has now been retired from active use &ndash; the Aurora                  Spaceplane. It&rsquo;s one of these planes that&rsquo;s been                  rumored to exist for a long time, but they&rsquo;ve retired                  it now. They&rsquo;ve got better stuff than that. They have <em>superluminal </em>craft &ndash; meaning                  craft that can travel faster than the speed of light. </p>                <p class="style7">We heard exactly the same story from our witness, Jake Simpson,                  who we met in October, last year. Jake Simpson has confirmed                  everything which I have said so far today. </p>                <p class="style7">Then, if we consider the cost of these programs, then we wonder                  where all the money has gone. Let me just present that as a                  possible answer to the question of where all the money has                  gone. </p>                <p class="style7">What&rsquo;s interesting about the underground bases scenario &ndash; and                  the weekend before last, we talked to Pete Peterson -- he called                  them <em>underground cities.</em> He says he&rsquo;s been in                  them. </p>                <p class="style7">Bill Deagle also reports having been in these underground                  cities. </p>                <p class="style7">Jake Simpson told us how there is an underground shuttle system                  that actually connected North America to Australia, under the                  Pacific Ocean. </p>                <p class="style7">Why would they do this? Why would they build these facilities?                  Jake Simpson told us that it was <em>standard defensive military                  thinking,</em> because they&rsquo;ve been aware of a coming                  problem ever since the Second World War, and that the military                  thinking, basically, was that, if there are going to be big                  problems on this planet, then they should dig in. This is what                  the military do when they&rsquo;re in a war situation; they                  dig in. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">Jake Simpson told us some extraordinary information. He said                  that this is a cyclical phenomena; it occurs in cycles, this                  energetic space, which the Earth is going through. It&rsquo;s                  the same series of problems that was responsible for what nearly                  a hundred cultures on this planet refer to as <em>The Great                  Flood</em>, which wiped out Atlantis, which was reported by                  the great historian, Plato, who never got anything wrong. </p>                <p class="style7">Jake Simpson told us that in some of these military installations,                  when they had been excavating the bases, they had found the                  existence of older bases that were not built by us. </p>                <p class="style7">We asked Dan Burisch about this story; he confirmed it. He                  said: <em>Yeah. </em>He said: <em>Not only can I confirm that                  but I can tell you where it happened. </em>He said: <em>It                  was in Norway. </em> </p>                <p class="style7">Or was it &ndash; oh, God, I can&rsquo;t remember &ndash; it                  was either Norway or Sweden, forgive me. I&rsquo;ll find out.                  In fact, I think he said Scandinavia, which is why I can&rsquo;t                  remember. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">He said there was a really bizarre situation that had occurred                  when a particular machine had been abandoned &ndash; because                  this is sometimes what they do, they build these big tunnels                  with these machines, and then they just leave them because                  they can&rsquo;t take them out again &ndash; and they went                  to another location and then they found the same machine in                  a different place but it wasn&rsquo;t their machine. It was                  an almost identical machine, but it was thousands of years                  old. </p>                <p class="style7">What Jake said, he said: <em>Yes. </em>He said: <em>We probably                    have handled this problem, but you&rsquo;ve got to appreciate                    that it&rsquo;s military thinking to be &ldquo;safe&rdquo;.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s military thinkingto still have the insurance, even                  though they think that we&rsquo;re safe. So they haven&rsquo;t                  abandoned their bases; they&rsquo;re still down there. </p>                <p class="style7">This is the kind of thing that Dan is going to be talking                  about this evening; this is the subject. The essence of it                  is that it&rsquo;s a little bit like we&rsquo;re in a movie,                  and you imagine a long movie with a lot of action in it that&rsquo;s,                  maybe, three hours long. And we&rsquo;re about half an hour                  before the end when things are getting really exciting. We                  don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to end, but it&rsquo;s                  a great movie. It really couldn&rsquo;t be more interesting. </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;re <em>in</em> this movie. To change the metaphor,                  it&rsquo;s like a virtual-reality game. This <em>is</em> a                  spiritual game and this reality <em>is</em> a sort of illusion,                  as the Buddhists would say, but it definitely feels real. </p>                <p class="style7">If we continue to talk about movies, we can talk about the                  movie <em>The Matrix,</em> when this may all be an illusion,                  in a sense, but it still feels very real and you can still                  get hurt in it. So, though it&rsquo;s a game, there&rsquo;s                  nothing trivial about it. If we have children and people that                  we care about and, if we care about this beautiful planet,                  then we have to take it seriously. </p>                <p class="style7">But the theme of this conference is that this is the kind                  of virtual reality game that, by understanding that it&rsquo;s                  a virtual reality game, we have the chance to create the outcome                  that we want. And have as much fun as possible while we&rsquo;re                  doing it. </p>                <p class="style7">So, this brings us right back &ndash; and here I&rsquo;m going                  to finish &ndash; to what George Green was saying in his little                  booklet <em>Messages For The Ground Crew</em>. He was told                  that it&rsquo;s nearly too late. But the most important word                  in that sentence is &ldquo;nearly&rdquo;. All the best movies                  have something that&rsquo;s &ldquo;nearly&rdquo; going to happen                  and then it doesn&rsquo;t happen. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m a mountaineer, and the best climbs I ever made were                  the ones where I <em>nearly</em> fell, but I didn&rsquo;t.                  Those of you who have a loving relationship may know that some                  of the best times are when your partner <em>nearly</em> left                  you, but they didn&rsquo;t. [laughter] </p>                <p class="style7">Because, after that, you&rsquo;ve got an opportunity to figure                  out how to make it all work out much better after that. So,                  as a collective Ground Crew &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not like                  the Ground Crew of different countries, this is just the Swiss                  Ground Crew and we say this as a bit of a joke &ndash; but                  we&rsquo;re all the Ground Crew. It&rsquo;s possible fifteen                  percent of the human race is a ground crew, really. </p>                <p class="style7">What we urge you to do &ndash; and when I say we, I&rsquo;m                  talking about the Swiss Ground Crew, and also speaking on behalf                  of Kerry Cassidy and myself, in Project Camelot. Some people                  write to us and they say: <em>What can I do? What shall I do?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And we say: <em>Do what you can. Do something. Jus</em>t <em>START</em> <em>doing                    something.</em></p>                <p class="style7">When Kerry Cassidy and I picked up this little consumer-grade                  camcorder and started talking to anyone who was willing to                  talk to us three years ago, we never imagined that the snowball                  could have become this big. </p>                <p class="style7">If you dare to believe that things are possible, then anything                  is possible. Your ability to make things happen is <em>only</em> limited                  by what you believe. So do what you can. Talk to people. Collect                  people together. Form groups and communities.</p>                <p class="style7">Keep people informed. Do everything you can do to wake people                  up, to support them in a transitional process of becoming more                  Awake and Aware, and to help them realize that there is a New                  World - If They Can Take It. </p>                <p class="style7">Thank you. </p>                <p class="style7">[applause] </p>                <p class="style7"><span class="style7"><br>                    <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2wN5oBQvv0" target="_blank">Click                  here</a></em> <font color="#990033"><em><strong>for the                  video</strong></em></font></span><br>                </p>                <p class="style7"> </p>                <div align="left">                  <blockquote>                    <p><font color="#FF9900" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="left"><strong>__________________________</strong></font></p>                  </blockquote>                </div>              </blockquote>            </blockquote>               <br><table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                          <!--DWLayoutTable-->                          <tr>                            <td width="350">                          <div align="center">                                  <table width="425" border="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                                    <tr>                                      <td bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>                                          <font color="#990033">Support Project Camelot - make a donation:</font></strong></em></font></p>                                    <div align="center"><a href="https://projectcamelotportal.com/donate.html"><img src="x-click-but21.gif" width="110" height="23" alt="Donate"></a>
