<br><br>

BILL RYAN (BR): So this is Bill Ryan here, and&hellip;

<br><br>

KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  Kerry Cassidy...
<br><br>

BR:
 ...from Project Camelot and we are honored, genuinely honored, and
privileged to have been invited here to the Exopolitics Summit in
Barcelona. And the date today, somebody, is?
<br><br>

NICK
POPE (NP): Twenty-third of July, 2009.
<br><br>

BR:
 Excellent. [laughter] This is the guy from the Ministry of Defence,
who always knows what day it is and what&rsquo;s going on. Thank you
very much, Nick.

<br><br>

What
we are doing here is we&rsquo;re gathering the opportunity to talk
with most of the speakers, who are appearing here this weekend on
Spain&rsquo;s first Exopolitics Summit. This is a formal/informal
gathering, a meeting of great minds, considerable experience between
us, I think. I won&rsquo;t add up the number of years -- it might be
embarrassing.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
just going to talk about the general subject of Disclosure and just
see, once we kick that ball off, where it might go in the next hour
and a half. Kerry...
<br><br>

KC:
 [laughs] I
would like to say that we are going to do a transition about an hour
and half into this, onto live radio. So I just want to say that
<I>caveat</I>
right at the beginning. On top of it, we decided we would start out
with introductions, so we&rsquo;re going to go around the table and
do some brief introductions of all the speakers here. I want to start
off with Paola, Paola Harris.
<br><br>

PAOLA
HARRIS (PH):  My name&rsquo;s Paola Harris. I&rsquo;m a little old
American journalist. I&rsquo;ve been working in this field for 30
years.

<br><br>

I
began working with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, astronomer, researcher,
professor at Northwestern University, because he was a consultant to
Steven Spielberg for <I>Close
Encounters of the Third Kind.</I>
And so I saw the film and I went to see him and he was my teacher for
6 years. I knew this was real, because I started with a scientist who
was working in this field.

<br><br>

I
just want to say that I graduated &ndash; because I&rsquo;m a
teacher; I also have a Masters in education &ndash; from ecology to
what I call <I>Exopolitics</I>.
And my definition of Exopolitics
is: <I>the formal academic
study of the UFO phenomena and contact and its political and
sociological implications for the planet.</I>


<br><br>

So
now I am mainly in that field and I&rsquo;ve written three books, the
last one <I>All Of The Above,
</I>which talks about
possible protocols of Exopolitics. Protocols -- things like we need
to look at a universal and planetary involvement. This is not an
American problem; it&rsquo;s not a French problem; it&rsquo;s not a
German problem -- it is a planetary problem.

<br><br>

So
that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m coming from. That will be my focus, that
will be my talk, and that is what I&rsquo;m interested in.

<br><br>

BR:
 Paola, thank you very much. Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Leary...
<br><br>

Dr.
BRIAN O&rsquo;LEARY (B&rsquo;OL):  My name is Brian O&rsquo;Leary. In
1967 I was appointed to go to Mars by NASA, as an astronaut. Then,
when the U.S. got involved in Vietnam, I became a free energy
activist and a peace activist.

<br><br>

The
contact experience and the whole UFO phenomenon, to me, ushers in
many more things that can help us with our own problems here on the
planet.

<br><br>

My
principle activity over the last several years has been to visit the
laboratories of some of the best and brightest so-called zero-point
and other breakthrough clean energy concepts.

<br><br>

My
latest book, <I>The Energy
Solution Revolution,</I>
talks about the politics and the social implications of a
breakthrough energy economy. I think that the energy &ndash; and
because of the suppression of free energy technologies, which has
been rampant, and the high danger of doing this kind of work &ndash;
makes it extremely symbiotic with the whole question of UFO/ET
disclosure.

<br><br>

So
to me <I>Exopolitics</I>
means going outside the box of normal inquiry and being able to
embrace those technologies which can truly create a sustainable
future for planet Earth.
<br><br>

BR:
 Wonderful.

<br><br>

STEPHEN
BASSETT (SB): You know, Brian, they are sending people to Mars now,
so you still have a shot.

<br><br>

[laughter]
<br><br>

KC:
 And, from what we understand, all you do is walk into a sort of,
like, elevator or &lsquo;jumproom&rsquo; to Mars, and so there&rsquo;s
no flight actually involved.
<br><br>

B&rsquo;OL:
 Well that sure beats chemical rockets.
<br><br>

BR:
 You bet.
<br><br>

KC:
 So, that&rsquo;s another story. And now...
<br><br>

BR:
 <I>[to Bob Dean]</I>
Do you know what? I&rsquo;d love to call you Dr. Bob Dean. I think we
should start calling you Dr. Bob Dean.
<br><br>

BOB
DEAN (BD):  Call me anything you like, as long as I&rsquo;m not late
for dinner.
<br><br>

KC:
 But didn&rsquo;t you say <I>Sergeant
Major</I>?
<br><br>

BR:
 Command Sergeant Major.
<br><br>

SB:
 Command Sergeant Major.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

BR:
 Bob, who are you? Tell the world. This is your chance.

<br><br>

BD:
 I have to stand up. I don&rsquo;t talk well sitting down.
<br><br>

BR:
 Very good.
<br><br>

BD:
 I first became aware of the extraterrestrial presence 45 years ago,
but I didn&rsquo;t come out and start speaking about it until 1991.

<br><br>

I
took an Oath when I was in the military. I had Cosmic Top Secret
clearance while I was at SHAPE [Supreme Headquarters of Allied Forces
in Europe] Headquarters in Paris and I took an Oath not to divulge
any of the classified material that I had learned while I was in the
service and while I was in Paris.

<br><br>

I
kept myself to that Oath until 1991. A couple of events occurred in
1991 that outraged me to such a point that I could not keep quiet any
longer.

<br><br>

A
good friend of mine, an Air Force fighter pilot, had just gotten back
from a full tour in Japan. He was flying his jet over Florida and he
had <I>an incident</I>
in the sky at 40,000 feet, where he looked out of his canopy to the
left and he happened to see a circular disk with a dome and he found
himself looking into the face of another human being looking at him.

<br><br>

When
he got back on the ground, he had to talk to somebody about it and
explain what happened. Well, speaking openly about it was his
mistake.

<br><br>

The
Air Force grabbed him, sent him to Newfoundland, to a United States
Air Force base in Newfoundland, without his family. Now, back in
those days, they did things like that. I&rsquo;ve been told that they
don&rsquo;t do those things anymore, but I don&rsquo;t believe it.

<br><br>

Another
thing that brought me <I>out
of the closet</I>, as it were
&ndash; a figure of speech &ndash; I was denied a promotion for a
job. I was working in Pima
County as an Emergency
Services Special Operations, Field Operations. My boss retired; I
applied for his job, I went through the entire hiring process, and I
was turned down for the job.

<br><br>

I
confronted the sheriff, who happened to have the hiring authority at
the time, and I was told that: <I>Well,
you&rsquo;re one of those people who speaks out a little bit openly
about UFOs. I can&rsquo;t have you working in here, in the Department
of Emergency Services.</I>

<br><br>

And
if you&rsquo;ll forgive my French, I got myself the meanest lawyer in
town and I sued the son of a bitch. I went through two years of
litigation, spent $20,000 of money that I did not have, and, after
two years of litigation, I won the lawsuit. I got the job; I got the
back pay; and I got $100,000 of tort damages.

<br><br>

But
I was so outraged at these two incidents &ndash; that I had been
denied a job promotion, and my good friend had been sent to
Newfoundland without his family -- I reached such a level of outrage,
frustration, anger, aggravation, that I began to violate my National
Security Oath and speak openly about what I had learned, what I&rsquo;d
been shown, what I had been told... because I had had Top Secret
clearances all my career.
<br><br>

BR:
 Anger is a great motivator.
<br><br>

BD:
 You see, I&rsquo;m not an easy person to get along with, sometimes,
by the very nature of the fact that I retired as a Command Sergeant
Major. We had a reputation, all of whom retired Command Sergeant
Majors have a reputation of being able <I>to
chew ass and take names</I>,
as they used to say, [Kerry
laughs] so I have no patience
and I have no toleration for lies.
<br><br>

BR:
 Bob, thank you so much for that.
<br><br>

BD:
 So, I came out of the closet in &rsquo;91. I&rsquo;ve been speaking
openly and bluntly about this subject. And I want to say to you all
who are here that this is the greatest, most important subject in the
history of the human race, because, essentially, it <I>is</I>
the story <I>of</I>
the human race.

<br><br>

Ladies
and gentlemen, good friends, all of you -- <I>we
are not alone and we have never been alone.</I>
We have had an intimate interrelationship with advanced
extraterrestrial intelligence from the beginning of our history, and
that interrelationship is still going on.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
very gratified to be a part of this conference here in Barcelona. And
I want to make it very clear to anyone who&rsquo;s interested is that
I take my hat off to the sponsors of this program for having the
courage to do what they&rsquo;re doing here.

<br><br>

This
is important, so pay attention, and listen -- because you ain&rsquo;t
seen nothin&rsquo; yet! [laughter]
Thank you.
<br><br>

BR:
 Bravo.
<br><br>

VOICE:
 Wow!
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay.
<br><br>

KC:
 Stephen Bassett...
<br><br>

BR:
 Following that, Steve, are you an angry man?
<br><br>

STEPHEN
BASSETT (SB):  Mm, not at the moment.

<br><br>

First
and foremost, I think, it&rsquo;s important that I say that I speak
for all of us, when I say that we have nothing against the perfectly
fine Canadian province of Newfoundland, and I look forward to going
there someday and talking about Exopolitics. So, for you
Newfoundlanders out there -- it&rsquo;s okay, no problem.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
Stephen Bassett. I founded the Paradigm Research Group in 1996 for
one reason only &ndash; to pursue the political resolution of the UFO
issue. That&rsquo;s it and that&rsquo;s all that I&rsquo;ve done for
the last 13 years.

<br><br>

The
science and the UFOlogy and the study of the sightings and all that
had gone about as far as it could, in my view, by then, and it was
clear that the government had a policy of withholding the truth and
acknowledgement. So that had to be addressed.

<br><br>

In
the early days, back then, &rsquo;96, &rsquo;97, we were looking for
new terms, a new lexicon, and we talked about <I>the
politics of UFOs,</I> which
is kind of a bridge term. And then we talked about the concept of
<I>Disclosure</I>.
That word turned up.

<br><br>

But
in 2000, the word <I>Exopolitics</I>
turned up, and that was due to the gentleman sitting to my left,
Alfred Webre, and, very quickly, he was joined by others, in
particular, Dr. Michael Salla.

<br><br>

But
the moment I heard <I>Exopolitics</I>,
that term... the moment I heard it, instantly, I knew that that was
the umbrella under which we were going to proceed. That was the boat
that we would sail in.

<br><br>

And,
so within a few days, I think within a week, I contacted Art Bell.
And there was something else going on at the time involving Danny
Sheehan, an activist Attorney, and I said: <I>We
need to get Alfred and Danny Sheehan on the show at the same time,</I>
because I was doing that for them back then, helping them put
together some shows.

<br><br>

So
Danny Sheehan and Alfred Webre came on. Danny was talking about some
events that occurred in the Carter administration and Alfred was
talking about that as well. They both had a connection with the
Carter administration and that was the reason, but, of course, Alfred
was talking about Exopolitics.

<br><br>

And
so from that day forward &ndash; 2000 &ndash; we had that new term.
In only nine years, it has now become on the edge of being a very
significant change in thinking, in terminology, a new field of study.


<br><br>

When
you Google it, you can get, I think now, something like 180,000
returns off of <I>Exopolitics.</I>
There&rsquo;re no extra pages; it&rsquo;s all about the UFO/ET issue.
It has no other use in the English language. Six hundred thousand, I
think, on Yahoo. It&rsquo;s on the verge of being in the dictionary.

<br><br>

So
that&rsquo;s in nine years. A new field has developed and you need
that. You need language in order to move forward. You need new
language to go into new places.

<br><br>

So
this conference is part of that. I&rsquo;m glad to be a part of it
and I look forward to presenting on Sunday.


BR:
 Very good.
<br><br>

BD:
 Bill, may I interject something? Make your needs known and there
will be somebody who&rsquo;s listening. [Kerry,
Bill laugh; background chatter]

<br><br>

SB:
 I need a milkshake, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to get
it.
<br><br>

BD:
 To your health -- to all of you, to your health.
<br><br>

SB:
 Very good<I>.</I>
<br><br>

BR:
 [to Kerry] Who
are you?
<br><br>

KC:
 Oh, well, no, no, no. Actually, I would like to continue around the
circle here.
<br><br>

BR:
 You don&rsquo;t want to say anything about Camelot?
<br><br>

KC:
 Well, I think, in the end, we can.

<br><br>

BR:
 Well, okay. Okay.
<br><br>

KC:
 All right? I think the next person that we need to introduce is Dr.
Michael Salla.
<br><br>

Dr.
MICHAEL SALLA (MS):  In 2001, I was a professor at a university in
Washington, D.C. &ndash; American University &ndash; and I was
teaching international politics. I had graduate-level classes.

<br><br>

I
saw the video of the Disclosure Conference, the Disclosure Project
Press Conference, and that really startled me. I just had no idea
that this kind of information was out there. Prior to that, I always
thought that extraterrestrial life was real, but, you know, some day
in the future, they&rsquo;ll contact us, and wow, the world will
change.

<br><br>

So,
when I saw that press conference, my world kind of really crumbled in
terms of how I understood international politics and what was
happening in the world.

<br><br>

And
so, one of the first things I did was I showed the press conference
video to a class. The class was on <I>Theories
of Conflict, Violence, and War</I>
and I showed it to the class, 25 graduate students; very progressive
Liberal Arts students at American University. I showed them the press
conference and then I said, you know:<I>
What do you think?</I>

<br><br>

And
I asked the students: <I>Well,
line up in terms of... line up. There&rsquo;s going to be a line on
the extreme right. If you agree strongly that this video is real,
that you agree with that very strongly, then get on the right. If you
disagree strongly, then get on the left. If you&rsquo;re kind of
neutral, get in the middle. </I>

<br><br>

So
I asked them to separate themselves, where they fit in on that line.
And, of the 25 students, two agreed, one strongly; and one moderately
agreed that the video was real, that the testimonies were valid; the
other 23 were either strongly opposed or kind of neutral about it.

<br><br>

That
shocked me because, basically, what I was seeing was that university
students weren&rsquo;t ready to accept this information as real. They
just came up with many of the standard responses:<I>
Well, they&rsquo;re making it up. How do we know it&rsquo;s real? CNN
would tell us if it were real. </I>So
that was kind of an important eye-opener for me.

<br><br>

I
found that the university administration was similarly not very
impressed with this topic. So that led to my forced removal from the
university and I&rsquo;ve been studying Exopolitics ever since, which
for me, really involves looking at three different processes, or
three different things.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
looking at: What are the main actors, or the individuals, involved
with the question of extraterrestrial life? So we looked at, say, the
role of the presidents &ndash; Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and so
forth &ndash; how they dealt with this issue of extraterrestrial
life.

<br><br>

The
second is we look at the institutions. What are the main institutions
that are being involved with this issue? So, straight away, we come
up with, say, the different intelligence departments, especially the
CIA Counter-Intelligence, the National Reconnaissance Office [and]
the NSA. So those are some of the institutions.

<br><br>

Then
I looked at what are the processes involved here? Some of the
processes are like maintaining secrecy, maintaining a psychological
warfare program to discredit, debunk this whole question in the
general public arena, and also funding these projects, which are
occurring behind the scenes.

<br><br>

So
those are the questions and the issues that I&rsquo;m very interested
in. I&rsquo;ve been doing this now for eight years and I&rsquo;m
still learning and still finding things to be amazed at. So, this is
truly an amazing field.

<br><br>

The
more years you put into it, the more things that you have more
questions about. I haven&rsquo;t yet reached that point where I feel
that I&rsquo;ve understood the big picture.
<br><br>

BR:
 That&rsquo;s right. The more you find out, the less you know.
[laughs] Thank you. Alfred?
<br><br>

ALFRED
WEBRE (AW):  Thank you very much. As I was saying, I&rsquo;m a
futurist, an activist, and a lawyer.
<br><br>

KC:
 Are you <I>Doctor</I>
Alfred Webre?
<br><br>

AW:
 You know, I always think that the lawyers tried to get a phony PhD?
[Kerry laughs] Because I
got an LLB and the Legal Association then changed all law degrees to
JD. So, technically, are we lawyers -- doctors? Doctor? What do you
think?
<br><br>

SD:
 You&rsquo;re a <I>Juris
Doctor</I>, which sounds even
better.
<br><br>

AW:
 Yeah, I&rsquo;m a <I>Juris
Doctor,</I> but I think that
it&rsquo;s kind of back door. [laughter] That&rsquo;s kind of how I
am. I always question things, and, well...

<br><br>

I
think that Steve has really given sort of a contextual background to
what has happened over the first ten years of Exopolitics.

<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;ve come here to this Summit to really talk about is the next
ten or eleven years, and that is in terms of what the larger
astronomical and cosmic cycles that will be occurring &ndash; in an
amazing synchrony &ndash; that will serve as motors or propellants of
the process of Disclosure, and more deeply, the process of a
transformation of our reality and the reality of all living things, I
think, which includes animals, plants, and minerals&hellip; [laughs]
according to some of you.

<br><br>

I
just want to bring all that kind of cosmic consciousness here,
because I think that that is really what Disclosure is about, and
what will fuel Disclosure will be an interactive elevation of the
consciousness of...

<br><br>

&hellip;and
I see a gentleman back there, who will remain nameless, who is
saying:<I> Yes! </I>

<br><br>

So,
just very briefly, we&rsquo;re talking about the solar cycle-24 from
2009 to 2020, with solar maximum at 2012 to 2013. And, by the <I>Index
of Human Excitability</I>
that goes back to 500 BC, we know that all revolutions, wars, riots,
and the fundamental fixing of things in society happens during the
solar maximum, which NASA tells us now is in May of 2013.

<br><br>

So,
in that general term, we&rsquo;re in for some really dynamite stuff.
If we want to be changing agents in a positive way, now&rsquo;s the
time to put out our agenda, as Dr. Bob Dean says.
[laughter]

<br><br>

Another
cycle is the cycle of the <I>Matrix
of Time Acceleration</I>,
which Dr. Carl Johan Calleman
and Barbara Hand Clow, a colleague of mine who lives in Vancouver,
Canada, also, talk about. That is, where time is accelerating, the
rate of change is accelerating; the rate of our consciousness is
accelerating.

<br><br>

And
there will be, probably, according to this theory, 20 times as much
change in the year 2011 as there was between 1999, when the Internet
started, and the beginning of 2011. So that&rsquo;s the backdrop for
how Disclosure can take place.

<br><br>

And,
finally, there are the larger Galactic and cosmic cycles, sort of the
source of our thoughts; of our reality; of our DNA, as well; of the
stars; the black hole at the center of our Galaxy &ndash; most
galaxies have black holes &ndash; and how <I>it</I>
will be programming the other 97 percent of our <I>junk
DNA</I> in the coming years,
so that we can become more capable of interacting and, therefore,
things will be disclosed.

<br><br>

So
I look forward to <I>this</I>
process, and the process of the weekend.
<br><br>

BD:
 Very good.

<br><br>

BR:
 Thank you, Alfred. I just want to say here that this idea of an
<I>Index of Human
Excitability</I> &ndash; I
just think that&rsquo;s such a wonderful name, I just love it -- I
take it very seriously; but, for me, it&rsquo;s like: <I>How
appropriate is that? How excitable are we all now? </I>You
know.<I> And where&rsquo;s it
going to go?</I>
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Well, calm right down. [laughter]
<br><br>

BR:
 Oh, I&rsquo;m getting too excited.
<br><br>

KC:
 You&rsquo;re getting too excited. And let&rsquo;s introduce&hellip;
<br><br>

BR:
 Nick.
<br><br>

NICK
POPE (NP):  Okay, I&rsquo;m just plain Nick Pope -- no doctor,
nothing like that. My background is government, British government. I
worked for the Ministry of Defence for 21 years. I did about seven or
eight different jobs in that period and the one which has lead to me
sitting at this table is a job that I did from 1991 through to 1994,
when I was responsible for researching and investigating the UFO
phenomenon for the British government.

<br><br>

The
brief was to look at the two or three hundred UFO sightings we had
each year to see whether they were already <I>defense-significant</I>,
which rather cleverly, in government terms, is something that we
didn&rsquo;t actually ever define. Perhaps that&rsquo;s a point for
later.

<br><br>

Anyway,
my views on this were that most of these things, of course, turned
out to be misidentifications. There were plenty of cases where these
things were seen by pilots and police officers, where they were
tracked on radar, performing speeds and maneuvers which seemed to go
significantly ahead of anything in our own inventory, including
prototype aircraft and drones.

<br><br>

So
my position on the UFO phenomenon is that, I think, whatever it is &ndash;
and I&rsquo;m not one of these people that have a neat answer -- I&rsquo;m
sure, perhaps, there aren&rsquo;t any neat answers in this business.
I think there are probably lots of different things going on, lots of
overlap.

<br><br>

But
my position is, whatever the nature of this phenomenon, or phenomena,
I believe it raises some interesting and important defense, national
security and their safety issues. Other issues too, which others
better qualified than me here are going to discuss on the societal
implications, the sociological implications. That&rsquo;s probably
less my field.

<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;m here to really talk about at this conference is something
which has been going for about a year and a half now &ndash; the
British government&rsquo;s ongoing program to declassify and release,
to the National Archives, the entire archive of British UFO files
going back to the &rsquo;50s and coming into the present day. So it&rsquo;s
interesting times in the UK and it&rsquo;s been a story all around
the world.

<br><br>

I
left the Ministry of Defence in 2006. I now work as a freelance
journalist, a media commentator, not just on the unexplained, but on
conspiracy theories, some political and some defense issues. That&rsquo;s
me.
<br><br>

BR:
 Very good. I like it.
<br><br>

BD:
 May I ask a question, please?

<br><br>

NP:
 Sure.
<br><br>

BD:
 The material that has been released so far &ndash; and I assume
you&rsquo;ve checked it, looked at it, read it &ndash; is there
anything in there of any real substance? [Kerry
laughs]
<br><br>

NP:
 Yes, there is. I think what there isn&rsquo;t&hellip; Let me answer
that in reverse. There <I>isn&rsquo;t</I>
&ndash; and I don&rsquo;t mean this in a disparaging way, but it&rsquo;s
a neat sound bite that I have used before &ndash; there isn&rsquo;t a
<I>spaceship-in-a-hanger</I>
smoking gun.

<br><br>

That
said, there are plenty of those sorts of cases that I was mentioning
where things have been tracked on radar performing some quite
remarkable speeds, plenty of police cases, plenty of military cases.

<br><br>

The
one that really stood out, and I discussed it on <I>Fox
News,</I> amongst others, was
the case of Milton Torres, the fighter pilot who, in 1957, whilst a
United States Air Force pilot posted over to the UK, was ordered to
shoot down a UFO over the mainland UK. So that&rsquo;s a case that
I&rsquo;m going to be discussing in some detail at this conference.
<br><br>

PH:
 I want to add that I interviewed, as a journalist, Milton Torres.
This goes to show that, yes, he was ordered to shoot down a UFO in
1957, so there <I>are</I>
shoot-down orders.

<br><br>

But
what I saw on a human level, and this is part of Exopolitics also, is
that he was very emotional about telling the story. He told it at the
X-Conference with Nick at Stephen Bassett&rsquo;s X-Conference in
April.

<br><br>

But
as a journalist, when I interviewed him, he was very emotional,
because his father had died two years ago, and he had kept this
secret for so long. He began to cry and was very emotional about it.

<br><br>

These
people keep these secrets so long, until the Ministry of Defence
released these files. It&rsquo;s a huge burden, and there are so many
of them. I think more countries should release their files.
<br><br>

BR:
 And it&rsquo;s happening.
<br><br>

KC:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

BR:
 It&rsquo;s happening.
<br><br>

KC:
 Well, Disclosure... That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.

<br><br>

BD:
 Did the Ministry of Defence ever, ever take a position on Peter
Horsley&rsquo;s memoir, where he said that he spent an afternoon
having tea with an extraterrestrial? And Peter Horsley was a retired
Air Marshall.
<br><br>

NP:
 Indeed. The Ministry of Defence, as far as I can tell, made some
efforts to, shall we say, brief against him. In other words, a quote
ended up in the media which was &ndash; and I&rsquo;m doing this from
memory -- but, it was something like: <I>How
unfortunate that a man, when he was posted to Strike Command at that
level and had his finger on the nuclear button, has been seeing
aliens.</I> So, behind the
scenes, they were disparaging him.
<br><br>

BD:
 Isn&rsquo;t that sad.
<br><br>

NP:
 It <I>is</I>
sad and it&rsquo;s disrespectful.
<br><br>

KC:
 It <I>is</I>
disrespectful.
<br><br>

NP:
 Of course, I mean, the other important thing is, of course, that
person,  as is often the case &ndash; well, always the case in this
situation &ndash; didn&rsquo;t give their name. They were just listed
as a<I> defense source</I>.
<br><br>

BD:
 Uh-huh.
<br><br>

NP:
 <I>A senior defense source
told us...</I>
<br><br>

BD:
 Peter Horsley was one of your top people; he was an Air Marshall. I
would have thought they would have paid attention and given some
respect to his opinion.
<br><br>

NP:
 No, they just... they deployed the usual line, which is: <I>Let&rsquo;s
put in a slightly disparaging comment, but see if we can get the
phrase &ldquo;little green men&rdquo; somewhere in there and let&rsquo;s
hope everyone just moves on.</I>
<br><br>

BD:
 Thank you. I&rsquo;m glad they got that on film.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. Thank you, Bob. Rob...

<br><br>

ROBERT
FLEISCHER (RF):  Yes!
<br><br>

BR:
 &hellip;you&rsquo;re waiting very patiently.
<br><br>

KC:
 Say your whole name and your background.
<br><br>

RF:
 All right. My name&rsquo;s Robert Fleischer. I&rsquo;m the founder
and coordinator of Exopolitics Germany and it&rsquo;s a great
privilege to be sitting here at this table with these brilliant
minds.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
studied a lot and read a lot of things you&rsquo;ve said and, I have
to say, I&rsquo;m just so curious how this is all going to unfold.
I&rsquo;m going to make it short, as I don&rsquo;t even have the
smallest part of the background that you all have.

<br><br>

I
came in touch with this field when I was 16 years old when I first
met the author, Erich von D&auml;niken, who wrote <I>Chariots
of the Gods</I> in 1968 or
something, and became friends and whatever. He was in my region and
we met, and we had discussions and conversations.

<br><br>

We
spent hours sitting on the lawn talking about God and the world and
the extraterrestrials. It was so exciting for me at the age of 16.

<br><br>

So,
you know, it kind of made me curious about what else was there? And
wouldn&rsquo;t it be important for us all to know about it? And why
isn&rsquo;t that on the media?

<br><br>

So
I started a journalist career. At a very early age, I started working
for a local newspaper. Then I was a presenter on a local television
show. So I kept working in this field and did my university degree at
the same time.

<br><br>

Then,
like five years ago, I think, I stopped working for television,
because I finally understood that the reason why these important
things which we are discussing here &ndash; which is the alien
presence and free energy and consciousness.

<br><br>

Why
that is not in the mass media is not because people there -- they
never think about doing that on the media &ndash; no; it&rsquo;s just
because they don&rsquo;t have the chance to do that, because
television is simply not the right medium to do that. People don&rsquo;t
want that on television, because television has a certain control in
our society, a certain control function.

<br><br>

So,
I stopped working for television when I came across a kind of free
energy device, made a TV report about it, and they wouldn&rsquo;t let
me report on it; they never actually broadcast that.

<br><br>

Then
a couple of years later, I also came across the Disclosure Project
Press Conference on the Internet and that kind of triggered my
curiosity again in this field because I thought: <I>How
the&hellip;</I> [laughs]


<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
impossible that, in the mass media, you always hear about weather
balloons or whatever, and then there&rsquo;s these highly-credible
military witnesses and insiders -- all of you just sitting here at
this table -- how is it possible that I&rsquo;ve never heard about
that?

<br><br>

So
I thought about <I>what could
I do</I>? So I founded
Exopolitics Germany, which is, as Stephen said, an umbrella for all
kinds of activities in this field, which are necessary to bring this
issue forward. It&rsquo;s such a huge field; it&rsquo;s physical
evidence, cover-up [and] Disclosure.

<br><br>

But,
what I&rsquo;m interested in -- and that&rsquo;s my personal interest
in this -- is the fact that these craft appear and disappear, shows
that our reality is obviously much greater than what we ever thought
it is. It&rsquo;s not just three dimensions, plus linear time. No,
it&rsquo;s much more than that. And I wanted to find out:  <I>What
is it? </I>

<br><br>

And,
if these extraterrestrial visitors master these dimensions -- these
superior dimensions, or supplementary dimensions, or however you want
to call them -- what does that mean for their states of
consciousness? How are they thinking? What kind of consciousness
level must they have to be able to adopt to &ndash; to master &ndash;
these dimensions? And what will it mean for us to understand how they
think?

<br><br>

Or,
to put it in another way, what would be the next level of evolution
in human consciousness? Because we might assume that we would also
come across these other dimensions sooner or later. So, that is what
I&rsquo;m actually interested in most.

<br><br>

But
what really interests me the most is the consciousness thing and I&rsquo;m
strongly convinced that everything is actually, in the end, a
question of consciousness. [to Brian] Yes, please.
<br><br>

B&rsquo;OL:
 Yeah, I was just going to say that: Yes, the more recent experiments
that are being done among humans is the incredible power of <I>positive
intention;</I> that people
coming together in groups with an intention can actually create that
reality.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
interesting that you have these two parallel tracks going on. One is
science, very good science, being done here on the Earth by
university scientists and, at the same time, you have the
ET-UFO-Disclosure issue, and the two are very intertwined, because
the ET/UFO phenomenon just points so clearly towards this.

<br><br>

We
need to know this and we need all the help we can get from our
off-plant/on-planet people that are going against the grain of Black
Ops, and going against the grain of these horrible agendas, that we
can actually heal the planet; we can have a sustainable future.

<br><br>

So,
from my own point of view, I&rsquo;m just very grateful to be here
among you and to be able to interact in this way.
<br><br>

BR:
 That&rsquo;s wonderful, Brian. Thank you so much. Let me have a go
here, <I>[to Kerry]</I>
then I&rsquo;ll let you have the last word.

<br><br>

KC:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

BR:
 For me, having this kind of conference sometimes feels like a group
of fishermen on a little island in the Pacific Ocean who are sitting
around a campfire trying to figure out whether there&rsquo;s anyone
else in the world. And what are these funny, shiny things that they
see up in the air? Do you believe that I saw this thing up in the
sky? It&rsquo;s like: <I>What
is that thing? Is that real, or what? </I>

<br><br>

Our
level of sophistication in asking these questions may not come close
to the level of sophistication that&rsquo;s needed in order to get
the answers. This is a bridge over, I think, into the world of
Exopolitics.

<br><br>

Because,
while those islanders around this campfire in the South Pacific might
be arguing with each other about whether they&rsquo;re all alone in
the world and what are these metal things that some people say that
they see in the sky, what we&rsquo;re really interested in is &ndash;
assuming that there <I>are</I>
other people in the world and assuming that they <I>do</I>
fly around in these metal things in the sky &ndash; what are their
agendas?

<br><br>

What
are <I>they</I>
doing with the world? What are they doing with <I>our</I>
world? What is it that <I>they</I>
might be doing that we might need to know about on our little island?
What might be their agendas for <I>us</I>?
What&rsquo;s it all about, and who are we, and how did we get here in
the first place?

<br><br>

And
if we look at the political implications of that, the questions are
<I>so</I>
enormous and <I>so</I>
far beyond the questions that one might get in &ndash; I don&rsquo;t
know &ndash; in a media article about: <I>Is
it possible that aliens could really exist?</I>


<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
like, come on! This is a given! But who are they? Where are they
from? When
are they from? What are they doing? What&rsquo;s our place in the
universe and what do we need to know in order to understand these
things?

<br><br>

What
do our own governors and politicians and military intelligence
specialists know that we are not being told? And <I>why</I>
are we not being told?

<br><br>

I
believe that the Exopolitics movement is trying to speak to those
issues and this is one of the directions in which, I think, that this
whole conversation would like to go.

<br><br>

Before
I introduce my colleague, Kerry Cassidy, I want to say that several
people here have talked about Steven Greer&rsquo;s Disclosure Project
Press Conference and I remember exactly where I was when that
happened.
<br><br>

I
was driving down a Scottish road at about two o&rsquo;clock in the
morning and this was coming over on live BBC Radio. I was so
astonished that I stopped my car to listen to it, because I didn&rsquo;t
know whether this was a joke. Then I realized this was real, this was
being streamed live. And I thought: <I>This
is amazing! This is now going to turn the world on its head. This is
extraordinary what Steven Greer is doing.</I>


<br><br>

I
wish he was here right now because I want to acknowledge him for
that. That was an incredible thing.

<br><br>

Then
many of us waited for what was next, what was going to happen after
this. Where was the Disclosure Project going to go next after this
incredible public relations feat which they created?

<br><br>

One
of the things that happened while we were waiting is that Kerry
Cassidy picked up a consumer-grade camcorder that is about as big as
this wine glass, from what I can remember, and started going to UFO
conferences to talk to them, because somebody had to do that job.

<br><br>

It
doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;ve got money, it doesn&rsquo;t
matter whether you&rsquo;ve got high technology, what you need is the
<I>intention</I>
to start talking to people, because this is a process that is,
ultimately, all about communication and that&rsquo;s all.

<br><br>

[to
Kerry] And you&rsquo;re a
master communicator. So I now want to introduce you with that. Tell
us about Project Camelot.
<br><br>

KC:
 [laughs] Well,
okay, thank you, Bill. That was a lovely introduction. Obviously,
we&rsquo;re Project Camelot. We&rsquo;ve been asked to come and host
this panel discussion. We&rsquo;re actually going to sit back and
just moderate. In many ways, we&rsquo;re not going to be speaking.

<br><br>

But
just to introduce us as the moderators, we formed Project Camelot
because we met at Laughlin and, actually, Bill was one of the people
I interviewed. He was one of my first interviewees, if you will.

<br><br>

When
I interviewed him on the subject of Serpo, I was very impressed by
his balance, by his command of the language, by his sort of good will
towards what I knew were probing questions that I have, sort of a&hellip;
<br><br>

BR:
 That&rsquo;s a euphemism! [laughs]
<br><br>

KC:
...sort of a talent with handling. He really rolled with it very
nicely; he handled it well. And yet he was very, very
straightforward.

<br><br>

He
wasn&rsquo;t taking sides, other than to say that the Serpo story was
something that he felt was important enough [that] it needed to be
discussed, it needed to be understood and it needed to be talked
about; it needed to be explored and investigated, and he was there to
encourage that process.
<br><br>

I
think that, in many ways, what happened when we formed Project
Camelot is that we really wanted to extend what was the initial
impulse of what -- I guess you could call the Disclosure Project
initially -- which was to go out, to put a camera in front of
somebody&rsquo;s face, to ask them questions, to let the audience
decide. And that&rsquo;s really been our mission from that day
forward.

<br><br>

We
decided this in Tintagel. We really connected there. We connected
with the past of King Arthur and the Roundtable and the idea of, not
a hierarchy, but a sort of a utopia in which all people were equal
and all opinions would be listened to.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
really what we wanted to do with Project Camelot. We wanted to allow
the camera and the power of the Internet to connect these people.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
been an incredible journey. We&rsquo;ve gone all over the world.
We&rsquo;ve interviewed some of the most charming, brilliant minds, I
have to say, that are here on planet Earth at this time. We&rsquo;ve
been fortunate in that way.

<br><br>

Some
of those people are sitting around the table today with us. Some are
in the audience.

<br><br>

So
it&rsquo;s been very exciting. It&rsquo;s been a lot of work, hard
work. We&rsquo;ve gotten tons of support from the audiences around
the world. We want to thank all of them, at the moment, for that.
<br><br>

BR:
 This is a bridge into our most recent whistleblower interview. It
has not been published; we&rsquo;re still waiting for the okay to do
that. This is with Dr. Pete Peterson.

<br><br>

We
interviewed him; it is nearly four weeks ago now, and he was a man
who had some extraordinary things to say. This is now our intro into
one of the main topics of this conference.
<br><br>

KC:
 Yeah, absolutely. What we&rsquo;re covering here is really
Disclosure. And I want to say that, in many ways, what it&rsquo;s
really all about is <I>truth</I>.
That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re interested in seeking with Project
Camelot, but it&rsquo;s also what this conference is about.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
really trying to get to the bottom of: What is truth? What does it
mean to be human? What does it mean to be a member of a Galactic
Community that involves peoples and extraterrestrials,
interdimensionals, all kinds of beings, all kinds of places, all
kinds of levels [and] all kinds of dimensions?

<br><br>

And
to take that holistic view, and the fact that we are multidimensional
beings, simultaneously here and many other places. We are time
travelers, all of us. We are ETs, all of us. And those are extensions
of the concept.

<br><br>

So
to get back to the discussion...
<br><br>

BR:
 What did Pete Peterson say?
<br><br>

KC:
 One of the things that our recent whistleblower was talking about
was the fact that there... Okay, well, you&rsquo;re supposed to talk
about this topic.
<br><br>

BR:
 I&rsquo;m supposed to talk about this topic? Okay.

<br><br>

What
Pete Peterson told us, on camera, is that he had heard from somebody
who had already booked the time with the networks, that there is to
be a planned Disclosure towards the end of this year by President
Obama, who will confirm the reality of contact with four or five or
six -- we don&rsquo;t quite know the number -- friendly ET races.

<br><br>

That
was what he was prepared to say on record. Now, this is the kind of
thing that Stephen Bassett has been waiting for, for the last 13
years, or longer...
<br><br>

SB:
 It seems like 30 years, actually, Bill.
<br><br>

BR:
 ...and what you&rsquo;ve been saying on record, that Obama is going
to be the <I>Disclosure
President</I>.

<br><br>

Now,
maybe none of us should hold our breaths, because it&rsquo;s quite a
long way to hold our breath until the end of the year. And Peterson
was also anxious to say that, just because it&rsquo;s planned, it
doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s going to happen. But we believe him
when he tells us that, at the moment, this is being slated.

<br><br>

There
are all kinds of reasons why this might be true. Because, as Stephen
has pointed out, in his many, many on-record comments about all of
this, America is under quite some pressure to disclose, because how
embarrassing would it be for them if some other little tin-pot
country like... Great Britain! [comments,
laughter] Or France!

<br><br>

[laughter,
comments, everyone talking at once]
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay, before we get into name-calling, I think we should start off,
on the question of Disclosure, knowing what our recent whistleblower
was talking about.

<br><br>

Could
you talk about how this affects your view &ndash; and we want to hear
from everybody &ndash; on whether you think this is possibly going to
happen, whether you think it&rsquo;s not going to happen and why; and
also what are the implications if it does?
<br><br>

BD:
 May I?

<br><br>

BR:
 What are the implications for Exopolitics if it does? And how does
Exopolitics respond, etcetera?
<br><br>

BD:
 It&rsquo;s been my observation that, when you get 25 people into a
room, you have 25 separate visions of what disclosure really means.

<br><br>

KC:
 Mm-hmm.
<br><br>

BD:
 And my point is this: I think Disclosure is underway and has been
underway for quite a while.

<br><br>

I
do not believe that you&rsquo;re going to have Obama getting on
national television and saying: <I>Gee
whiz, guys, we&rsquo;ve got some news for you.</I>
[Kerry laughs] <I>We&rsquo;re
not alone. We&rsquo;ve been visited by guys from other star systems
and other planets. Whoopee!</I>


<br><br>

And
everybody gets excited, you know. They all run to the door to get it
on the evening news.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
not the way it&rsquo;s going to happen. Now, that&rsquo;s my view,
and I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that it could happen that way,
although I doubt it. [Kerry
laughs]

<br><br>

But
you know, you cannot come out on TV and say: <I>Oh,
lookee! We&rsquo;ve known this for years. We&rsquo;ve kept it from
you because we didn&rsquo;t think you could deal with it, but now
we&rsquo;re going to level with you and tell you the truth. Isn&rsquo;t
that nice?</I>
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay.

<br><br>

BD:
 It&rsquo;s like opening <I>Pandora&rsquo;s
Box</I>.

<br><br>

BR:
 This is where we start to get some really interesting reactions from
people. Already people are leaning forward in their seats because
they want to&hellip;
<br><br>

BD:
 You&rsquo;re not going to get a Disclosure like that. Recognize that
it <I>is</I>
underway. It&rsquo;s taking place. It&rsquo;s been underway for some
time and it&rsquo;s the form of <I>subliminal
education.</I>

<br><br>

When
I made a presentation some time back at Laughlin, Nevada, I spoke
about <I>The Three Stevens
and the Apocalypse</I> and
this one... [indicating
Stephen Bassett]
<br><br>

SB:
 I was the Apocalypse.
[laughter]
<br><br>

BD:
&hellip;this was one of the <I>Three
Stevens</I> that I spoke
about &ndash; Steven Greer, Stephen Bassett, and Steven Spielberg.

<br><br>

BR:
 Mm-hm.
<br><br>

BD:
 And I also gave the definition of the Greek word <I>apocalypse,</I>
which is not at all what most fundamentalists think it is, that of
the Four Horsemen riding... what is it?

<br><br>

AW:
 Armageddon.
<br><br>

BD:
 War, famine, plague, pestilence, and all that. The Greek word simply
means <I>the disclosure, the
unveiling, and the revealing.</I>
Really. That&rsquo;s been underway now for over 20 years, and Steven
Spielberg has played a major role in that...

<br><br>

KC:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

BD:
...with his movies, and that TV special he did was dynamite, really.
Was it <I>Taken?</I>
<br><br>

KC/PH:
 <I>Taken</I>.


<br><br>

BD:
 Yeah.
<br><br>

BR:
 <I>Taken</I>.
<br><br>

BD:
 That was so filled with real truth&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 Yes. Yeah, absolutely.
<br><br>

BD:
&hellip;that I would like for them to run it again, and maybe they
will. But you&rsquo;re in the midst of Disclosure, my friends, and
it&rsquo;s happening right around you every day.
<br><br>

BR:
 I want to ask... Michael Salla wants to jump in.
<br><br>

KC:
 I don&rsquo;t think anyone would disagree with that.

<br><br>

BR:
 Michael wants to jump.

<br><br>

KC:
 I think we&rsquo;d all agree; <I>we
</I>are part of <I>Disclosure</I>.


<br><br>

BR:
 Michael wants to jump in.
<br><br>

KC:
 But Stephen was supposed to have a chance.
<br><br>

SB:
 No, no, no. Michael can jump in any time he wants. I always defer to
Michael -- that way I keep getting asked back to Hawaii after his
conferences. [laughter]
<br><br>

KC:
 I&rsquo;m deferring to Michael!
<br><br>

MS:
 I have an idea as to what might be released at the end of this year.
One of the things to keep in mind is: <I>What
does the government know about this? </I>

<br><br>

One
of the things that I think is very important is that, in 1969, there
was [a] memorandum released by a Brigadier General called the
Bolender Memo, and that basically said that UFO reports are separated
in terms of their national security implications. Those that weren&rsquo;t
very significant went into the <I>Blue
Book</I> system, and we know
that Blue Book ended in 1969.

<br><br>

Those
that had significance in terms of national security went into the
cIrvis
system, which is <I>The
Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence
Sightings, </I>and that went
into a separate body for study and analysis, because it had national
security implications.

<br><br>

So
you have two bodies of information concerning UFOs &ndash; those that
are kind of like just the sightings that are recorded by radar that
became part of the Blue Book system and were eventually released in
&rsquo;69 or up to &rsquo;69; and those that concerned more
significant events, such as crashes of UFO disks, that went into the
CIRVIS system.

<br><br>

So,
eventually, where did all of these reports end up?

<br><br>

I
believe that the CIRVIS reports went into the archives held by
various corporations that have been studying these files for reverse
engineering applications, for then contracting out to the military
services that might want to use some of this technology. And the
other stuff that didn&rsquo;t have national security implications
just became available through the NGO [Non-Governmental
Organizations].

<br><br>

So
what is going to be released at the end of this year? I think the key
is that what you mention by Dr. Pete Peterson was, you said
<I>up to six races</I>.


<br><br>

Well,
I have a kind of memory about who&rsquo;s talked about <I>up
to six races.</I> In 1977,
there was a Congressional Research Study done that was exploring the
question of UFOs: <I>What&rsquo;s
out there?</I>

<br><br>

It
was President Carter who asked for this to be conducted, because he
asked the CIA to be briefed on UFOs and he was told: <I>No</I>
&ndash; Bush said no to him. So he couldn&rsquo;t get his hands into
what was actually in the archives. He couldn&rsquo;t find out, but he
asked the Congressional Research Study to go out and do a study on
this.

<br><br>

This
was done by Marcia Smith, who was a senior congressional science
investigator. She went out and she came up with a report that between
two to six extraterrestrial civilizations have been visiting the
Earth.

<br><br>

That
report was not compartmentalized. That was something that Danny
Sheehan says he has a copy of that. He never released it, but he has
a copy of that.

<br><br>

So
I think, if Peterson is correct that towards the end of this year,
we&rsquo;re going to have a Disclosure, I think what that could be
would be something like Obama ordering the Congressional Research
Service to make this document publicly available. So you&rsquo;ll
have a Congressional Research Study becoming available saying that up
to six extraterrestrial races are visiting us.
<br><br>

BR:
 Is it possible that the ETs could force our hands by making
appearances that would require that there be a governmental response?
<br><br>

SB:
 It&rsquo;s possible but it would not be a good thing.
<br><br>

BR:
 It wouldn&rsquo;t be a good thing?
<br><br>

SB:
 No.

<br><br>

BR:
 Why is that?
<br><br>

SB:
 There&rsquo;re basically two kinds... By the way, there&rsquo;re a
number of things I&rsquo;d like to comment on at some point.

<br><br>

BR:
 Yeah.
<br><br>

KC:
 Well, no. Yeah, I think he&hellip;
<br><br>

SB:
 There&rsquo;re two basic kinds of Disclosure, okay? One is
<I>self-disclosure.</I>
That&rsquo;s when the nations of the world go to their people &ndash;
right? &ndash; the ones that they have this social contract with to
govern, and say: <I>Look,
this is what we know; we&rsquo;ve got these beings here; we know this
about them; don&rsquo;t be alarmed, be alarmed, whatever and we&rsquo;re
going to try to inform you about this.</I>


<br><br>

And
then over a period of time, weeks, months, years, the public will,
I&rsquo;m sure, be quite interested in learning everything they can.
That honors the social contract. That&rsquo;s the way governments are
supposed to operate; that will instill a certain... at least assure
that the contract is honored. That&rsquo;s one kind.
<br><br>

The
other kind is <I>force
majeure</I> Disclosure.
That&rsquo;s where the governments keep going: <I>I
don&rsquo;t know anything; nothing here; nothing going on; nothing to
see; no problem &ndash;</I>and,
all of a sudden, big ships start appearing over the cities of the
world.

<br><br>

Well,
yeah, now the government has to come forward and say: <I>Well
guess what? Yeah, they&rsquo;re here and we didn&rsquo;t tell you.</I>
Everybody, of course, is scared to death.

<br><br>

So,
in that version, the social contracts of all the First World nations
&ndash; Third World nations have other things to worry about &ndash;
is broken.<I> You didn&rsquo;t
tell us? You lied? Here they are. What are we going to do?</I>


<br><br>

And
so, that is a much more traumatic, much more disruptive process that
will lead to a lot more problems. And it&rsquo;s non-trivial; the
difference is quite profound.

<br><br>

Now,
the ETs can do it anytime they want, but I can&rsquo;t worry about
that. They&rsquo;re going to do what they&rsquo;re going to do. They
don&rsquo;t tell me what they&rsquo;re up to. All I can do is try to
help us get this self-disclosure process out of the way.
<br><br>

BD:
 I&rsquo;d like to ask a question, if I may, and I want to ask it of
Alfred. Do you believe that this extraterrestrial presence should be
a national security issue?
<br><br>

AW:
 Well I believe yes and no. The yes part is, as researchers, we have
come across the fact that, <I>de
facto,</I> it is. The
extraterrestrial presence is&hellip; has been handled since at least
the &rsquo;50s on a national security level.

<br><br>

For
example, I worked with a researcher, Andrew Basiago,
who in the company of
his father, who was a CIA official, in 1981, at an Air Force base &ndash;
at
<I>Wright Air Force
Base in New </I><I>Jersey
</I>[Ed
note:googling &ldquo;Wright AFB&rdquo; brings up Wright-Patterson AFB
in Ohio; googling New Jersey AFBs brings up McGuire AFB in
Wrightstown, NJ] &ndash; had a meeting
with three Martian astronauts from the intelligent civilization that
lives under the surface of Mars.

<br><br>

Now,
they were there on a visit, on a coordinating visit, with the Central
Intelligence Agency, which means that, if this version is true, since
at least 1971 &ndash; just that data-point alone &ndash; the US
Central Intelligence Agency, and perhaps other intelligence agencies,
have some sort of a strategic alliance within our Solar System.

<br><br>

Now,
that may be a legitimate matter of national security. But now we have
a whistleblower coming forth who is alleging this and who has a lot
of data to back it up. So that may be a Disclosure, the issue of the
U.S. presence on Mars.

<br><br>

C
I mean, Mr. Basiago in 1981 went to Mars via teleportation from a CIA
teleportation launch room in El Segundo, California, in the company
of then-CIA agent Courtney
Hunt. These are all
actual names.

<br><br>

And
Virginia
Olds, a lifetime CIA
employee, called him in January of &rsquo;09 to confirm that the CIA
knows that there is an intelligent civilization under the surface of
Mars. She said a million. I have no idea whether that is effective or
not.

<br><br>

So
the ship is leaking. And whatever the matter of national security was
in 1971 that caused these astronauts to come and have their liaison
meeting, those matters should become public.

<br><br>

And,
if there is an Obama announcement... I mean, I&rsquo;m just saying
this from the particular view that our organization is pressing Obama
to disclose the U.S. presence on Mars, and to disclose the strategic
alliance that it has with the intelligent civilization on Mars.
<br><br>

BD:
 Now, do you believe the American public, just as an example, and the
public in the world at large, can deal with this information?
<br><br>

AW:
 Yes. And, you know, we have objective data for that. If we go to the
2002 Roper Report, which is available on the Internet, there was a
specific question that asked in that way. And the answer came back
that 85 percent of the American public &ndash; and, by extension, I
would imagine most adult publics &ndash; are congruent in terms of
their religion, their personal values.

<br><br>

The
question was: <I>If the
government announced that there was an extraterrestrial presence, how
would this impact you?</I>

<br><br>

And
the answer was 85 percent: <I>It&rsquo;s
congruent with my religion, with my personal values, and it would not
ruffle any of those very much.</I>


<br><br>

So
we say: <I>The time is now,
the place is Mars.</I>

<br><br>

Now,
will the U.S. do it? They may not, because in certain ways, according
to certain military plans or intelligence plans, it&rsquo;s possible
the U.S. base on Mars, or bases on Mars, may be considered one of the
most strategic and important as a gateway to occupying the Solar
System via teleportation.


BR:
 I&rsquo;d just like to say, Alfred, for the benefit of the cameras
here and for anyone here who doesn&rsquo;t know this story, that
Henry Deacon, who is here at this conference, who was here in this
room &ndash; I can&rsquo;t see him right now -- is he there?

<br><br>

SB:
 No. He stepped out.
<br><br>

BR:
 He stepped out. He&rsquo;s just coming in. Here he is.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay, well... go ahead, yes.
<br><br>

BR:
 But we can talk about his testimony because we&rsquo;ve already got
it on the Camelot site and he supports this fully, as best as I&rsquo;m
aware. The Mars base has got a population, a peak population of
670,000. They travel there...

<br><br>

KC:
 Give or take...

<br><br>

BR:
 Give or take a few. You know, it depends on what you call <I>human</I>
and what you don&rsquo;t. They look like us pretty much. People can
commute from this planet.
<br><br>

KC:
 They&rsquo;re known as the Anunnaki. That&rsquo;s the name they go
by.
<br><br>

BR:
 Some of them are. Some of them are the Anunnaki of old, the same
ones Sitchin talked about, who are now in a couple of factions. But
there is a wide range of races, basically, who all look like humans,
just as we do.

<br><br>

And
the travel is through... ah ... essentially, it&rsquo;s
teleportation. And this is one of the biggest secrets. They&rsquo;ve
got this huge base there. It&rsquo;s a multi-functional base.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. But we&rsquo;re allowing the panel to talk here.
<br><br>

BR:
 Exactly, but this is important information to put on camera.
<br><br>

KC:
 Yes. It is.
<br><br>

BR:
 And we just wanted to support you and we also want to support Andrew
Basiago who we also know. We&rsquo;re saying the guy&rsquo;s not
crazy. We&rsquo;ve got somebody here in this room who can support
this story. He doesn&rsquo;t want to go on camera, but he can speak
to the microphone, if he wants to.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. What about some of the other panelists here? What is your
point of view of Disclosure?
<br><br>

PH:
 First of all, what you&rsquo;re saying is probable, Alfred. I will
say this now, but I will also disagree as far as going to the public
with Grade Twelve, when we haven&rsquo;t done Grade One, Two, Three,
Four, and Five of Disclosure yet, because for me, as a teacher...

<br><br>

And
this is teaching the public, because they may be able to assimilate
this information, but it&rsquo;s hard to digest. It changed my whole
entire life.

<br><br>

When
I met Hynek, [Ed note: Dr.
Josef Allen Hynek] it took a
long time for me to understand that contact was real. I didn&rsquo;t
want to believe that. I was a nuts and bolts UFOlogist. I wanted to
look at the craft, the sightings. I did not want to go to the contact
part. That was very hard for me, because it changed reality.

<br><br>

So
I disagree with saying that the general public could swallow this
very easily.

<br><br>

But
I will support Alfred in this way: I did do an interview with Pierre
Giorgio Agina, who was Marconi&rsquo;s partner, and while I was doing
that, he mentioned that Marconi, with the Vatican, had had Martian
contact is 1939.

<br><br>

And
I knew this material. I did not put it out there, because the
implications of the Vatican with Marconi and extraterrestrials are
very heavy, but I will talk about it today.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
not sure that the general public can go there, if they haven&rsquo;t
understood the nature of Roswell; the nature of the cover-up; the
nature of visitation due to, maybe, our use of nuclear and the fact
that <I>all aliens are not
Grays</I>.

<br><br>

These
are things that we need to get straightened away, because I can tell
you from having lived in Europe, where aliens look like us -- the
Pleiadians, Billy Meier -- and that there are people in the universe
who look like us.

<br><br>

And
then I go and move to America, and on every single magnet, t-shirt,
magazine and everything, I see only the stamp of the Gray being. That
is where they want us to remain in America, because, if you believe
that these extraterrestrials could be &ndash; and the Martians are
some of them that look like us, you know, if you believe that -- then
it becomes very dangerous.

<br><br>

As
Colonel Corso said: <I>We
weren&rsquo;t afraid of the Extraterrestrial Biological Entities </I>&ndash;
he said at the Pentagon &ndash; <I>because
they were Extraterrestrial Biological Entities; we w</I><I>ere
deathly afraid of their creators, or what could be walking in the
halls of the Pentagon.</I>

<br><br>

So
this is very complex. I&rsquo;m not sure the general pubic, the whole
world and everybody needs to have the whole, entire thing in one big
swallow, because it&rsquo;s very difficult to digest.
<br><br>

BR:
 Yeah. Thank you, Paola. I want to bring in Brian here, because I
have a sneaking idea that I know what he&rsquo;s going to say, but
I&rsquo;ll ask him this question, which is: Have we got time to be
precious about this Disclosure issue? Do we have time on planet
Earth, do you believe?
<br><br>

B&rsquo;OL:
 Well, we&rsquo;re obviously at a huge crossroads here and I&rsquo;m
aware of the psychological implications of the grieving process
that&rsquo;s going on right now, that we&rsquo;re grieving an old
paradigm and transforming to a new. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, in some of
her work, talks about the phases of grief.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;ve
been in a state of mass denial, denial always being the first stage;
the second stage is usually anger.

<br><br>

I
had this bumper sticker for a while that said: <I>The
truth will set you free, but first -- it&rsquo;ll piss you off!</I>


<br><br>

And
I think that we&rsquo;re poised on that. People are getting very
angry and outraged by these cover-ups, so there has to be a process
that, maybe, we can help engineer &ndash; and I know, Steve, you&rsquo;ve
been involved in this &ndash; of creating some sort of negotiating
where the transition isn&rsquo;t too painful for any particular
group.

<br><br>

And
that we can get out of this swamp you referred to, Bill, the swamp of
deceit and lies and spin. We&rsquo;re, I think, in a situation now
where, maybe, we can discuss with our <I>adversaries</I>.
Obviously, the darkest agendas we hear about -- like eugenics and so
forth -- are horrible and we don&rsquo;t have to do that.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;d
like to be able to discuss that, ultimately, with the rest of the
world, or even with those individuals who are in charge, to be able
to say: <I>Well, maybe we can
do something else? Maybe we </I>can<I>
have a world of free energy? Maybe we can support the current
population? Maybe we can make the contact experience a positive thing
for all of us?</I>

<br><br>

And
that is the direction I&rsquo;d like to see us go in. Rather than
coming out fear, come out of a sense of diplomacy and understanding
all around.
<br><br>

BR:
 That&rsquo;s a great bridge into the potential role of Exopolitics.
I wonder who wants to pick up that ball and run with it.

<br><br>

RF:
 Can I say something?
<br><br>

BR:
 Rob.
<br><br>

RF:
 Now, you are all great researchers sitting on this table and it&rsquo;s
doubtlessly so interesting listening to all of the insider stories
and all of the testimony; but, what you just said actually means that
we need to find a way to -- and Paola said that, too -- we need to
find a way to prepare the understanding of the whole thing.

<br><br>

We
need to make people aware that we are not looking at something like
at a bottle, like I&rsquo;m looking at the bottle and, you know,
after five minutes, I will have looked at it from any perspective
possible and I will have understood it entirely. No, it&rsquo;s the
opposite.

<br><br>

We
are on this tiny little planet. We&rsquo;re looking outwards. That
means that <I>anything&rsquo;s</I>
possible in the universe, so I think that&rsquo;s the paradigm thing
that we have to prepare, but how do we do that?

<br><br>

I
think the strategy is probably not in telling everything we know and
giving out the information like that. I think it&rsquo;s much more
basic than that. It&rsquo;s like... Well, yeah, let&rsquo;s [unclear] evidence,
first of all.

<br><br>

And
then I think it&rsquo;s also about showing relationship between the
UFO cover-up and certain other things that are going on in the world.
I think that&rsquo;s also important.

<br><br>

When
we talk about the understanding of the greater reality that these
visitors live in, it&rsquo;s also important to know that <I>we</I>
wait for the paradigm shift, but there are also people in quantum
physics who&rsquo;ve been waiting for paradigm shifts for almost one
hundred years now, [laughs]
you know?

<br><br>

So,
maybe, the third thing is cooperation with certain other groups;
anyway, I think the nuts-and-bolts thing is the most important.
<br><br>

B&rsquo;OL:
 And I just want to return for a moment to the question of <I>how
much time do we have?</I>

<br><br>

I
happen to feel that the ecological condition of the Earth &ndash;
just giving my research &ndash; is so grave that we&rsquo;re going to
have to create the foundation of cooperation in the very near future.
To be able to come up with new paradigms of Disclosure that will
allow us to develop the new paradigm; to develop the energy sources
we need to tide us over; to be able to directly confront alternative
agendas and be open about it, at least with those who are in control
now.

<br><br>

And,
in terms of the release of the information, that it would be based
more on just reasonable &ndash; ah, how should I say it? &ndash; a
reasonable, but chaotic transition period.
<br><br>

BR:
 [laughs] That&rsquo;s great!
<br><br>

KC:
 Well, I sort of want to say that, in answer to what Bob Dean is
talking about, Disclosure is happening. It has been happening. We&rsquo;re
part of it &ndash; Camelot; Paola, one of the early pioneers in this
area; Alfred Webre, Exopolitics; you know, Michael Salla, etc. &ndash;
it&rsquo;s already been done, you know, if you will, the <I>work</I>
has been done.

<br><br>

This
is the funny thing about all this. Obama&rsquo;s announcement is
actually coming at the end &ndash; I&rsquo;m just positing here for
your consideration, from my point of view &ndash; the end of the
process rather than the beginning.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
already out there. Spielberg did it for you. We did it. It&rsquo;s
been done. The fact is, what we&rsquo;re really talking about, is
something coming at the tail end for the people who have not gotten
clued in up to now.

<br><br>

Now,
I&rsquo;m well aware, it&rsquo;s the majority of the populations out
there, quite possibly, but I actually have a sort of optimistic view
of the level of intelligence out there, and the fact that we are all
ETs anyway.

<br><br>

So
you have to keep in mind that we came here &ndash; these bodies are
temporary, okay?  It&rsquo;s a much bigger reality, and even the most
silly, dumb person out there has consciousness of having been able to
go other places -- in their dreams, if nowhere else.

<br><br>

So
the consciousness is actually out there. It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s
ready; it&rsquo;s primed. And it&rsquo;s been primed in part by <I>the
controllers</I>, if you will,
as well as us &ndash; okay? &ndash; who have picked up the ball and
run with it; and we, hopefully, have run with it farther and faster
than they wanted us to.
<br><br>

BR:
 Maybe
it sounds as if the ground &hellip; perfect [overtalk],
I mean, is this perfect timing now?
<br><br>

KC:
 Well, listen to what Alfred Webre&rsquo;s talking about, and the sun
cycle 24, and actually what we&rsquo;re moving into, which is the
period between now and 2017.
<br><br>

BR:
 The Matrix of Time Acceleration... how about that?
<br><br>

KC:
 We&rsquo;re talking about a consciousness change that&rsquo;s making
all of this possible and accelerating it all very quickly, so that
change is not going to happen in the same way it&rsquo;s happened in
the past. It <I>can&rsquo;t</I>.


<br><br>

Brian
O&rsquo;Leary, you&rsquo;re right. So where do we go from here? How
do we get it out there even further?

<br><br>

And
<I>if</I>
the government... the government is coming at the tail-end, because
the government is not in control; Obama is not in control. We all
know that. He&rsquo;s the front guy. Okay?

<br><br>

They&rsquo;ve
got technology, according to our whistleblowers, that is quite likely
10,000 years in advance of anything we are dealing with right here
and now in this reality. We&rsquo;ve been held back for a very long
time on this planet.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
time that we actually take this baton in our hands, and say: <I>Okay.
You want to run with this, Obama? We&rsquo;re going to give you a run
for your money.</I>

<br><br>

And,
actually, that&rsquo;s what <I>this</I>
is all about, okay? We&rsquo;re going to release this video. It&rsquo;s
going out there and we&rsquo;re going to say: <I>You
know what? We already know</I>.


<br><br>

We
don&rsquo;t <I>need</I>
Obama sitting on a pedestal to tell us that Disclosure is now.
Disclosure is. It has been, and we are clued in.

<br><br>

Now,
if the rest of the people out there aren&rsquo;t clued in, we&rsquo;re
going to continue to do our jobs. We&rsquo;re going to wake up the
planet. Obama is just one individual and he&rsquo;s only representing
a very fake part of the government anyway.

<br><br>

So
let&rsquo;s say <I>Disclosure
is Us,</I> in a certain
sense.
<br><br>

PH:
 Very briefly, can I remind you of one scene in <I>Close
Encounters</I>? And this is
very brief.

<br><br>

All
the witnesses that had seen the lights came to a press conference,
something like this, and they all said: <I>I
saw this light,</I> and
everybody in the media believed them. They were, you know, they were
talking about their experiences.

<br><br>

Then,
out of the blue, this man stands up in the back and says: <I>And
yeah, I </I><I>saw Bigfoot
the other day.</I> Right back
&ndash; <I>I saw Bigfoot &ndash;</I>
and Bigfoot exists, so let&rsquo;s not even go there. I
closed down the whole entire truth-saying, because Spielberg was
trying to say that people cannot digest too much, too fast.
<br><br>

BD:
 Speaking of digestion, do you believe &ndash; and I&rsquo;ll throw
this out to the panel &ndash; do any of you believe that the American
public, <I>en masse,</I>
can deal with the reality of having been <I>lied
to</I> and <I>cheated</I>
for the last 65 years, if they were to learn that we have a separate
space program?
<br><br>

KC:
 Didn&rsquo;t you learn it? Didn&rsquo;t you deal with it?
<br><br>

BD:
 Yeah, and my whole damn paradigm collapsed around me! That&rsquo;s
why I&rsquo;m sitting here angry today!

<br><br>

You
know, I have guns in my home [Kerry laughs] and I&rsquo;m almost to
the point of grabbing my American flag, putting on my old uniform,
and going into the damn streets and causing a riot, because of the
fact that I have learned how many lies have been told for the last 65
years.

<br><br>

Now,
take Joe Blow, Joe Six-pack out there in Kansas, and he finds out
that he&rsquo;s been conned for so damn long...
<br><br>

PH:
 [laughing] It&rsquo;s true.
<br><br>

BD:
 ...by a bunch of stinking politicians in Washington. And he&rsquo;s
going to find out that he&rsquo;s got a separate space program? That
NASA is a joke? And we are on Mars and we can step through a portal
in S4 and end up in Pine Gap?

<br><br>

These
are realities and facts, and it took me a hell of a long time to
digest this and not lose it, you know? Because I&rsquo;m a typical
Joe Blow.

<br><br>

I
was trained to be an infantryman. I&rsquo;ve been a grunt. I&rsquo;ve
been in two wars. I was <I>this
close</I> to going out there
and beating the hell out of some of those government authorities.

<br><br>

Do
you think that the average American is going to be able to handle it?
<br><br>

KC:
 They just found out that the government has been lying to them and
stealing their money right, left, and center. They&rsquo;re still not
in the streets.
<br><br>

BD:
 They are suspicious and they have feelings that maybe they&rsquo;ve
been conned. But the con is so <I>big</I>...
<br><br>

KC:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

PH:
 Yes.
<br><br>

BD:
 ...that when the average guy out there in the street in Kansas City
or Sacramento or wherever, when this really hits him, the impact is
going to be devastating.
<br><br>

BR:
 There&rsquo;s a possibility here that they might ameliorate their
own problem of Disclosure by giving us some other problems, as well
to take our minds off this. This is beyond the scope of this
conference, but if they crash the dollar...
<br><br>

KC:
 No, actually, let&rsquo;s look at this. Why now? Think about this.
Let&rsquo;s have some... step up to the plate here, Michael. What do
you think? Why now?
<br><br>

MS:
 I think that a big factor that&rsquo;s driving this is that there is
a major dispute between the controllers.

<br><br>

On
the one hand, you&rsquo;ve got those that are tied up with the
corporations -- Majestic, who have trans-nationalized this whole ET
phenomenon; reverse-engineering going to corporations, and enormous
profits beings made, deals being made, ETs being involved in these
deals.

<br><br>

And,
on the other hand, you have a kind of more constitutional group --
which is lead by the U.S. Navy -- that has traditionally been more
tidy with representing the national interests.

<br><br>

The
Navy, as I understand it, is very upset with the way the whole
management system has been trans-nationalized, has been taken out of
the hands of constitutional government in the U.S., and that the Navy
is fighting back.

<br><br>

And
I think it&rsquo;s very important to point out the role of the Navy
in the Obama administration. His Director of National Intelligence,
Dennis Blair, is an ex-four-star Admiral. His National Security
Advisor, Jim Jones, is a four-star Marine and the Marines are
traditionally Navy; they&rsquo;re a kind of sub-service of the Navy.

<br><br>

And
now you&rsquo;ve had recently the appointment of a NASA administrator
who is an ex-Marine, a General, again, in the Marines.

<br><br>

What
you have here is, in the background, a process by which these... and
all of these people that I&rsquo;ve named have been briefed fully on
the UFO issue. They know about the black projects. And I think they
are the ones that are preparing the groundwork for this to be moved
forward.

<br><br>

I
know that the Navy has been also involved in other things, such as
the 2008 disclosure of secret meetings at the UN concerning UFOs;
and, that a senior Navy UFO working group was involved in that; and,
I&rsquo;ve recently been out to confirm that two of the
Vice-Admirals, three-star Admirals, that were involved in that were
-- there was a blowback for that -- and they were basically forced
into retirement; and, I can&rsquo;t name them at this point.

<br><br>

But
there&rsquo;s been a struggle. The Navy took the initiative,
disclosing these UN meetings; there was blowback; two three-star
Admirals were sacked, but that was kind of 16 months ago, so there&rsquo;s
been time for the Navy to reorganize.

<br><br>

Now
you&rsquo;ve got these Navy people surrounding Obama, so I think we
are going to see this moving forward and the Navy&rsquo;s going to be
playing a big role in that.
<br><br>

BD:
 Do all of you remember the movie called <I>Seven
Days in May</I>?
<br><br>

MS:
 Sure.
<br><br>

BD:
 And you know what the gist of it was, that a bunch of admirals and
generals were going to take over the country?
<br><br>

KC:
 Mm-hm.
<br><br>

BD:
 Let me tell you something &ndash; and I have this from first-hand
sources &ndash; there is a whole passel of Generals and Admirals that
are so pissed off about this cover-up and the lies that are being
told that they&rsquo;re <I>this
close</I> to...

<br><br>

I
don&rsquo;t know whether they want to take over the country, but I
think they damn well want the truth to come out.
<br><br>

KC:
 Yeah. I think we can see some of the resignations that have been
happening as a result of that.
<br><br>

BD:
 These guys are honorable men. They give their lives to their country
and they&rsquo;re not going to put up with this crap any more.
<br><br>

KC:
 I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about the United States and this is a
worldwide situation. What&rsquo;s interesting is that Henry Deacon is
in the audience and he is nodding <I>yes</I>
to what you&rsquo;ve just said.

<br><br>

And
in fact, Camelot is alive and operational &ndash; and we have been
told this by a number of people on the inside &ndash; because, we are
protected by just such people, which we call <I>White
Hats</I>. It&rsquo;s just a
terminology.
<br><br>

BD:
 The reason I&rsquo;m alive is because of some of those people.
<br><br>

KC:
 There you go.
