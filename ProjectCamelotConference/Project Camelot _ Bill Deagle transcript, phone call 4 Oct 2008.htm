For several years now I&rsquo;ve been having                  some pretty powerful visions. And visions sometimes come in                  what I call &ldquo;shards,&rdquo; or &ldquo;fragments&rdquo;.&nbsp; And                  sometimes it&rsquo;ll be what I call a final &ldquo;catalytic                  event,&rdquo; or vision that&rsquo;ll pull &rsquo;em all together,                  so you can see all the pieces of the puzzle come together. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The best way to describe this -- and I described this, of                  course, in our talk on Sunday last -- that people that are                  really what I call connected, they are, if you want to call                  it, like the retinal cells in the back of the body of mankind.                  They can see the light, in other words, or the images coming.                  And as the images start to come together, one of their jobs                  is, in a sense, is to receive that and then translate it through                  the body. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In various                    cultures where they are considered -- like the Hopi medicine                    man or the prophets of ancient Israel or others &ndash; there&rsquo;s                  always a percentage of people in the population that, from                  their bloodlines, their genetics and their spirit DNA, they                  are called very connected or <em>intuitive</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, of                    course, you know I am one of those. There are many. I&rsquo;ve just watched a portion of an interview with Miriam                  Delicado, and she&rsquo;s another one. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yes. That&rsquo;s                absolutely true.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah. This morning what happened... and to                  describe this... If you&rsquo;ve ever read portions of                  the Old Testament in the Bible, you&rsquo;ll see that sometimes                  these ancient prophets, what they would do is go to the... literally                  the back of the cave. And they would, you know, put on sack                  cloth and ashes. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they would kind of literally <em>grieve</em> in                    the spirit for what&rsquo;s coming, and try to intercede                    to actually change the timeline of the corporate body of                    mankind around them -- like the ancient nation of Israel                    or the Hopi Indians -- or knowing where to go to places of                  refuge.&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the                    best way to describe this is... I call it <em>spirit-pain</em>,                  almost like a pain that&rsquo;s searing pain, that&rsquo;s                  just like the most intense pain you can imagine -- but not                  in the physical body but in the spirit -- starting from the                  top of my head and going right to the soles of my feet. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This morning... coming in spasms, almost like contractions,                  like a delivery, lasting so many minutes and then just letting                  go. And just, you know, tears and a feeling of terror. And                  images. And images of people... literally, colors gone,                  and kind of a bluish faded light. And people literally spinning                  around, holding the sides of their heads, screaming in terror,                  not knowing which direction to go. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A feeling of <em>unleashing</em> and                    knowing that whatever&rsquo;s                  going to happen, even if all the events don&rsquo;t all happen,                  they&rsquo;re going to start on Tuesday the 7th of October,                  and... [gasps] I&rsquo;m starting to go back again.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.                Bill...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so intense, it&rsquo;s hard to describe.                  It&rsquo;s almost like you can feel this intense kind of terror                  coming over the whole body of mankind, that you can feel palpably,                  that&rsquo;s so powerful... Think of the most painful                  thing you&rsquo;ve ever had, let&rsquo;s say, like a root canal                  or a broken bone, or something that&rsquo;s so intense you                  can actually almost see spots in front of your eyes. Think                  of that in the spirit. That&rsquo;s what I feel. It&rsquo;s                  a... [sound of pain]</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK. Bill, I totally understand where you&rsquo;re                  coming from.

It&rsquo;s                    very strong. And I had this happen before Oklahoma City,                    before 9/11, before Katrina, before the [Banda] Aceh tsunami,                    right before the attack with tectonic weapons on Sichuan,                  China. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each of                    these, I had, you know, what I call... The best                  way to describe it is a <em>night terror</em>, or a feeling                  sometimes coming in little flashes, lasting seconds to minutes                  over weeks and so on, and then finally kind of, like a crescendo,                  rising towards something where it&rsquo;s going to culminate.                  And then the images start to pull together from these little                  broken shards into a full image. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    morning... that event is starting to happen.                  They&rsquo;re all coming together. And I&rsquo;m not sure exactly                  all the events, but I believe the economic things that have                  happened in the last few weeks are part of that whole process.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; [noise in background] I can hear the Blue Angels,                  by the way, over my head because we&rsquo;re really near Miramar                  Air Force Base.

It is a kind                    of a horror that is economic. And I see people spinning around                  in terror from destruction, like a bomb going off. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can feel                    burns.

You want to somehow stop it, and you&rsquo;re                  trying, but you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t stop it.                  You know, we&rsquo;re praying. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve                  been doing this morning. I&rsquo;m saying: <em>How do we avoid                  this?</em> But can I feel it coming. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This bailout -- I found out in the spirit, because I get what                  I call <em>spirit-knowledge</em> -- was actually a willing                  blood sacrifice. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because,                    if you think of the work of the people, literally exchanging                    their time -- which is their blood -- for money, all money                    is blood. It&rsquo;s basically your <em>time</em> on                  this world. You&rsquo;re allotted time, converted into the                  means of commerce, and you exchange that for goods or services. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And when                    the Congress did this, it was a willing blood sacrifice to                    the global Luciferic financial system.

Well, the thing is, I&rsquo;ve known -- in the                  physical -- that they&rsquo;ve been doing operational war games,                  just like the mini-series, <em>Jericho,</em> we discussed in                  the interview on video. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I&rsquo;ll just go back a bit. Back in... I                    think it was 1987, I was traveling on I-80 just south of                    Chicago and I had one of what I call my visions. And literally,                    like the blink of an eye, like the fiftieth of a second,                  I can be gone into spirit for minutes to hours. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what happened is, at that moment I was not driving there.                  I was standing on the side of the highway. And I could see                  people walking and RVs and the road, just people crawling along                  a few miles per hour. And a lot of people walking on the sides                  of the highway, and people crying. And I looked back, and I                  saw this giant mushroom cloud rising. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I asked                    them what had happened, and they could hardly speak. And                    they were saying that they saw the destruction of the core                    of Chicago. And I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s                  the city, but that&rsquo;s just one of the visions I had. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then I&rsquo;ve seen other cities, a city in an area that&rsquo;s                  very flat. You know, it could be a plains city. It could be                  Los Angeles. Whatever, it was a city that was very, very flat.                  The landscape was not hilly. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I saw                    this, you know, it was like 20 or 30 blocks vaporize. And                    I saw people running around and screaming as shards of material                    were flying. And they looked up and they could see through                    their hands, and they could see their bones almost like an                    x-ray. And then, of course, immediately afterward they were                  blind; they couldn&rsquo;t see anything. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, I&rsquo;m not sure what the timeline is. But I know that                  the events that are going to be unleashed Tuesday are going                  to result in a nuclear event in a U.S. city. And it will be                  one or more cities that they&rsquo;ll do it in. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK. Ah... OK.                  Thank you for telling us and sharing your vision. Ah...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And it could be now or it could be next spring,                  but I know that the events are... Something&rsquo;s going                  to happen Tuesday, and it&rsquo;s a financial thing that will                  set in motion the events that will result in this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It could                    be as early as the middle of October, but I know that what&rsquo;s coming is martial law. And it may not last                  that long because they don&rsquo;t even have the troops or                  the capacity to manage the entire population. But I know that                  they are trying... It&rsquo;s like Katrina. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They&rsquo;re                    preparing the population for a much wider and larger event,                    just like they prepared Oklahoma City for 9/11. This is the                    next step from 9/11. And Tuesday the events are going to unleash                  this next event.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.                    Bill, I wanted to ask you if you are OK with us saying your                    location at the moment. Because, as a psychic intuitive,                    your location to the event will influence the depth of your                    vision, so to speak, I believe. So are you comfortable with                    saying the city and the state?

There are other countries in the world at                  the moment that are actually doing similar kinds of bailouts                  for their banks.

It&rsquo;s like a triangle                  on yellow. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;ve seen in my visions the movements of boxes off of                  containers on the west coast. I&rsquo;ve seen the activation                  of people that looked like they were just regular citizens;                  they were Oriental. And all of a sudden they were donning uniforms. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;ve seen rail cars arriving up through Mexico that                  had special markings on the outside, and they looked like they                  were very new containers. They didn&rsquo;t look like they                  were old recycled ones. And they had special markings on the                  side, coming up through Mexico.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Something&rsquo;s                    happening. And I see the movement of submarines off the coast,                    both the east and west coast, that include both Chinese and                  Russian submarines. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.                    We have also been getting information about something in                  Britain. Have you gotten anything in that regard?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah.                    Some of the catalyzing events, I believe, financially, may                  not start in America. They may start in Europe. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK. There&rsquo;s                    also information out there that the bailout was actually <em>wanted</em> by the European banks                  and by various institutions overseas.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah. In fact, that&rsquo;s the reason why... is                  that the bailout is not enough. The word I get in the spirit                  is that it&rsquo;s not enough to stop the hemorrhaging. It&rsquo;s                  like someone who&rsquo;s bled out 20 units of blood and you                  give them 2, and hope that, if you can put your finger over                  the hole, they won&rsquo;t die. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, this                    bailout is not going to be sufficient to stop the hemorrhaging.                    In fact, it&rsquo;s actually going to encourage                  it. It&rsquo;s almost like when you give someone what&rsquo;s                  called platelet-poor blood. They don&rsquo;t have enough platelets                  to clot the wound out so that it&rsquo;ll stop hemorrhaging. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It actually encourages further hemorrhaging. As the banks                  scramble to get funding to stop their bank collapsing, the                  bank run starts. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.                Understood, Bill, about that. And...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; I believe that the bank run will be the most probable                  first major financial event that&rsquo;ll occur as these banks                  start collapsing. And I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;ll be                  mainly American. It&rsquo;ll be European banks, like the Bank                  of Scotland, the Bank of Belgium. The banks in Europe are the                  primary ones that I feel in my spirit are most likely to go                  down first. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.                Understood, Bill.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Would                    you advise people to take their money, their cash, out of                  the banks at this time?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yes. Get it out of the banks quickly. Convert it                  to gold and silver coins, food, supplies. Have water. Have                  means of protection. And if you&rsquo;re in a big city, any                  big city in the United States, Canada, or Europe, have, even                  if you stay in the city, have a route to get out of the city                  quickly when you see the signs occurring. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Make sure                    that you know how to do civil defense if there&rsquo;s                  a nuclear explosion that occurs in a city, or the release of                  a biological, which is also another possibility, because I&rsquo;ve                  been having images of release of a pandemic. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I don&rsquo;t know when that&rsquo;s going to occur. But                  I know it&rsquo;s not just a single event that&rsquo;s going                  to occur here, with a nuke, that there&rsquo;s going to be                  a pestilence that&rsquo;s going to occur, perhaps after that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yeah.

What                    would the public presentation, or rather, what would the                    presentation to the public be, of the connection between                    any financial situation and a nuclear event that would be                    based on an enemy state or an enemy group? Is this going                  to be presented as a coincidence?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, one of the visions that I had last night                  was, I saw a number of senior leaders of the Saudi Arabian                  royalty contacting the members of the Bush administration and                  senators, and demanding that this bailout money be given first                  in line to them and to their banks, because they&rsquo;re teetering... Which                  I thought was kind of strange. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they                    wanted to be first in line; and there was a lineup of banks.                    And the issue was, who was going to get the first dibs at                    this money, which is basically buying bad debt. It&rsquo;s                  almost like buying, you know, something worthless, and mortgaging                  the future of Americans.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, it&rsquo;s like taking peoples&rsquo; property and literally                  throwing it into a pit. And the people are lining up, these                  countries, as to who&rsquo;s going to get first dibs on that.                  Who&rsquo;s going to get this debt, and who&rsquo;s going to                  be able to haul it away? You know, and sell it to America and                  get real assets?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What I                    feel is that this is primarily to bail out European and Arab                    banks that insisted on it. That there&rsquo;ve been                  some deals going on that... between these various power                  brokers and those that are talking about doing a false-flag. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And one of the things that I saw many years ago, in 1988,                  was a vision of high above the Strait of Hormuz, and the Strait                  was cut off. This was not an act by Iran. It was an act by                  our side. And the Strait stopped, and there was no shipping,                  and in an instant the world economy crashed. And this was the                  fulcrum event that actually started the movement toward the                  final invasion of the Middle East by communist China, and the                  events that are going to transpire in the next years.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. Bill, can I ask you... have you shared this                  information that you&rsquo;re getting this morning with, for                  example, your own family?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yes,                I have.

She understands.                  Because when these happen, sometimes I can have little pieces                  that don&rsquo;t make sense, but when they start to come together,                  I know it&rsquo;s very close to the event. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is                    like the morning I woke up and was having a terrible time,                    on the day of 9/11. And I was, you know, having these spasms                    of pain, but the intensity with which I had it this morning                    was 100-fold worse than at the time of 9/11.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.                I was...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; This                    is really bad. Whatever it is, I can feel it coming on, almost                    like a very serious sickness through the whole body of mankind,                    you know, like an attack. And, of course, of trying to force                    the timeline of mankind toward an eventuality of destruction                  rather than of liberation. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I believe,                    of course, that we can change that. But, unfortunately, I                    don&rsquo;t see the signs of the intervention happening,                  or people waking up enough to kind of steer us away from that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the worst part is the fear. Because what I see happening                  is a massive increase in fear, which is an astral or spirit                  sacrifice to these higher Luciferic gods, if you want to call,                  the transdimensional entities I mentioned. Fear is actually,                  if you want to call, almost like the movie for children, <em>Monsters,                  Inc.</em> It&rsquo;s, literally, they drink it for their energy.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right.

So I started going through                    my list and trying to pray and discern it. And then I said: <em>Well,                    they&rsquo;re in Australia.

I think the                  financial events will be first. And as the banks start to collapse,                  this is going to be a runaway situation which I believe will                  result in a bank holiday, and people panicking, and... just                  like they started to panic and started to yank their money                  out of, last year, Northern Rock, in the UK? And then, of course,                  they just recently did it at the banks in Los Angeles here,                  just back in the spring. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the                    insolvency in this debt-load doesn&rsquo;t... Because                  I believe it&rsquo;s gonna probably first strike in Europe.                  And then people are going to realize this is not a US problem,                  it&rsquo;s a global problem. And what we&rsquo;ve been doing,                  actually, is, they called on America to bail out banks in Europe                  that are now insolvent. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;ll start a run coming back, hitting the smaller                  banks as people pull their money out of small banks and put                  it into ones they think are going to be more likely to weather                  the storm. And then eventually they&rsquo;re gonna start rolling.                  So I believe... That&rsquo;s what I think the sequence                  of events will be.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; I understand. What would you say... I                    mean, are they going to be closing, for example, methods                    of escape? Because there will be some people listening here                  that will want to get away.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yes,                  they are -- not only in the spirit, but in the physical. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yeah, they                    are going to close methods of escape. In fact, I know this                    from working with FEMA and seeing their Special Classified                  Operations manual as late as the late &rsquo;90s. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They have                    two, what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;perimeter zones&rdquo;,                  around every large city. The first one is &ldquo;near&rdquo;,                  which is near, usually, the circumvential highway. And there&rsquo;s                  another perimeter zone, that&rsquo;s usually made up by foreign                  troops or mercenaries or people like Blackwater Security, that                  are going to be 30 miles out. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they&rsquo;ll                    use both conventional weapons, as well as crowd-control-type                    of directed-energy weapons, you know, pepper spray cans that                  can hit thousands of people at once, and other types of technology. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But yes,                    they are. You know, it&rsquo;s hard for them to control                  all of the side routes. So, if you have, you know, an alternate                  route map, you may be able to get out of the city by going                  out on the, kind of, these little side highways. But if you                  try to, you know, they&rsquo;re actually going to try to ring                  around all of the large cities when they start to clamp things                  down. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And one                    of the first things they&rsquo;re gonna do is, they&rsquo;ll                  shut off the grid. The grid is going to go down. As soon as                  they declare a state of national emergency, the grid will go                  down, the store shelves will immediately be completely cleared,                  within 3 hours, in most cities. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, the                    biggest thing is not just food, but people are gonna run                    out of water within hours in some places where the water&rsquo;ll                  be shut off. In other places it&rsquo;ll continue running.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So they need to have: Water -- #1. Food -- #2. Things that                  they can barter with. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know                    -- I talk about it continuously on my Nutrimedical Report                    show, and it&rsquo;s on my website, nutramedical.com                  -- they need to get ready for pestilence, radiation burns,                  a possible radiation cloud circulating the planet, from a local                  or regional nuclear war in the Middle East. The explosion of                  a city, with an anvil of radiation going downwind. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they                    also need to be prepared for kind of keeping themselves in                    touch with their spirit as to which cities are in danger.                  I believe that large US cities sitting on a plain or a valley,                  in a warmer climate, you want to be prepared to be either out                  of the city... Primarily exit west, or south, or north,                  but do not go east of any of these large cities.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; What about airports? Do you feel that people will                  be able to, at this time at least, use the airport to get out                  of here if they decide that that&rsquo;s what their inner truth                  tells them to do?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; The airports -- If there&rsquo;s a window to get                  out of the airports, it&rsquo;ll be before they declare full                  martial law, which will occur after a bank holiday. The airports                  will be the first to close down. They actually... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had this                    from my classified sources as well, that there&rsquo;s                  56 transfer points into Canada. And they have hardened them                  down so that they can lock them down completely to 6, with                  titanium bars, kevlar cages, and glass, remotely-controlled                  weapons. And they can actually lower entire vehicles, even                  long trailers, you know, 60-foot long, with an elevator directly                  into the ground, to be soft X-ray scanned, and to interdict                  anybody in the vehicles and remove any weapons. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So they                    have that already set up. That was actually being completed                    at the end of 1999, before 9/11, and it&rsquo;s now                  absolutely completed as of 2003. So they&rsquo;re gonna close                  off and lock down the border to Canada. And it&rsquo;s a little                  harder to lock off and close down Mexico. Most of the area                  there is pretty nasty desert. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Are you making any provisions for yourself and your                  family?

Basically it&rsquo;s gonna be almost                  like a lynch-pin. It&rsquo;s like when someone&rsquo;s shoved                  out of a window, I guess is the best way to describe it, and                  you&rsquo;re gonna fall 70 stories to the ground?

And the first                    major event is gonna be the mass starvation of 100 million                  people in the next 12 months.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.

The climate shift has already chewed away                  at the crops in Australia, with the drought, the spread of <em>Puccinia                  graminicolous</em> fungus across Africa, and the largest locust                  plague in hundreds of years across Africa, right through to                  the Middle East. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The climate                    shift that&rsquo;s been occurring is causing massive                  droughts and massive floods in other areas.

Now they plan to bring                  in and introduce genetically-modified, cloned, food that will                  destroy the biology of the people and make them very, very                  weakened to pandemic.

They have been doing labs                  down in Mexico for years. And that&rsquo;s where a lot of these                  things that are found by people in strange areas, or isolated                  areas, of Mexico, are from these clone laboratories, where                  these chimeric monstrosities escape from the laboratory. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they&rsquo;re                    also, of course, working in underground facilities at cloning                    human beings that have had inserted transgenic genetic enhancements                    to bring in genes from animals so they can enhance their                  physical capacities to make super-soldiers. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a facility doing experimentation and research in                  America, in collaboration with the communist Chinese.

And it&rsquo;s not just the monkeys observing                  other monkeys so that they start to learn how to, you know,                  wash their food in seawater, or whatever, so it has more taste                  or nutrition, or whatever. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It deals with a thing that the corporate body of mankind --                  when visionaries pass the vision, then they literally give                  the option to make decisions that change the timeline of the                  whole corporate body. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We don&rsquo;t have to have all of this, or the fullness of                  this, overwhelm us like a cataclysmic tsunami. We have a choice                  to kind of co-create whether our future&rsquo;s going to be,                  you know, stifled or derailed. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I&rsquo;m sure that there&rsquo;s                    been numerous events that have already been stopped or delayed                    significantly in the last number of years, just by actions                    by people like yourself, Project Camelot, by myself, by many                    others that are intuitives that can pick up what I call the<em> spirit knowledge</em> that                  transcends time/space, that, when it goes back to the body,                  it brings the people to a level of awareness that they can                  start making decisions and preparing to survive disaster, and                  to avert it, and to pray against it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other words, to start visualizing and taking physical action                  and spirit action, I call it, where we can derail this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because, really, the only way that these things can be done                  is if we willingly allow it. Just like the bailout. There should                  be a march on Washington, DC, on Monday. There should be millions                  of American citizens putting signs in their windows and their                  cars: No Bailout! There should be a degree of rage that every                  congressional and senate office is inundated with calls and                  emails. Because the bailout is a <em>willing</em> blood sacrifice. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And without the willingness, then the sacrifice of America                  is not acceptable. And silence and inaction in the face of                  this abomination is, in fact, a <em>willingness</em> to allow                  the process of the next stage of the sacrifice to proceed,                  the ceremony, if you want to call, on the grand scale.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yes. So speaking about it is not to bring it on.                  But speaking about it, from the point of view that you&rsquo;re                  coming from, and people like you, is as a preventative measure,                  to waken others.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah. That&rsquo;s what a prophet does. The actions                  of a prophet are not to prophesy an event that can&rsquo;t                  be changed. It&rsquo;s to prophesy pathways and timelines that                  you can then decide because you are co-creators of your own                  future. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Otherwise,                    there&rsquo;d be no purpose for a prophet. All                  a prophet would be would be a seer telling people there&rsquo;s                  nothing you can do about it, that you&rsquo;re just a bit of                  flotsam and jetsam pushed along by the timeline of events,                  and you really have no control of your future. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And nothing                    could be further from the truth. In fact, that&rsquo;s                  the core of the central lie of all religions -- I call it &ldquo;real                  lies going on&rdquo; -- that Yeshua Ha&rsquo;Masaich Jesus                  spoke about. Because he spoke against religion, as the <em>opposite</em> of                  relationship and the spirit-truth which actually controls all                  reality. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on right now. They&rsquo;re                  trying to convince us we can&rsquo;t control. So, when people                  get overwhelmed with fear... And what I talked about this                  morning wasn&rsquo;t fear. When I was going through these,                  you know, spirit-spasms of pain, I wasn&rsquo;t in a state                  of <em>fear</em>. I was in a state of <em>intercession</em>,                  which means becoming aware of what&rsquo;s going on, tuning                  into it, and then try to give people alternatives so that they                  can stop it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we have to rise up now. There has to be a level of rising                  consciousness out of the populations of Earth, or this will                  not be averted.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK. Thank you, Bill. I think that&rsquo;s really                  valuable for people to hear, and very vital, along with the                  information that you&rsquo;re giving here.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah,                    the key thing, if I was to make one statement: If by our                    inaction and our silence we <em>allow</em> the financial                  events to proceed, then we have given a willing blood sacrifice                  that&rsquo;ll precede the events, starting on Tuesday, the                  7th of October, that will result in the sequence of nuclear                  events, pestilence, and, ultimately, the destruction of our                  planet. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so,                    we have the time now to actually repent of that, speak out,                    and do not drink in fear, even when we see events starting                  to transpire, but to start being pro-active, to start taking                  personal events and spiritual events seriously that we&rsquo;ve                  perceiving happening. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And being not only our keeper, but the keeper of our brothers                  and the people in other countries -- because they are also                  in the process, by bringing about this financial collapse,                  proceeding with the first stage of the economic eugenics, of                  killing the first 100 million of us. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is like, in the body of mankind, cutting off our right                  hand. So the 100 million that are distributed in the third                  world are about to be sacrificed.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right. And so we... the fact is that people                  can act, and every act that they take that begins to go against                  the possible future that&rsquo;s being outlined here...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Exactly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; ...is                    actually an act of prayer, if you actually take action based                  on spirit-knowledge, as you said.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah.                    Prayer, in a sense, is what I call <em>Voice</em>.                  In other words, you&rsquo;re speaking <em>Voice</em> or <em>Intention</em> into                  reality. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And by                    us also communicating that with others, we speak -- just                    like I&rsquo;m doing now -- I&rsquo;m speaking not just                  words of knowledge or wisdom, I&rsquo;m speaking what&rsquo;s                  called <em>spirit-words</em>, just like all the prophets would                  speak. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From all                    backgrounds, whether they&rsquo;re native or non-native,                  religions all over the Earth, there were always those that                  were intuitive enough to see in the spirit realm and to know                  that danger&rsquo;s coming, that were cyclical dangers of the                  cosmos and the galaxy, or those created by others to create                  chaos to get control of their &ldquo;Order&rdquo; out of the                  chaos. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening, is they&rsquo;re                  now going through a ceremony to bring about the chaos that&rsquo;ll                  bring their &ldquo;Order&rdquo; into control. And we don&rsquo;t                  need to participate. But we have to not be a willing sacrifice,                  by resisting it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely. OK, Bill, we&rsquo;re                  going to close this now.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah. I appreciate it. This is what I was supposed                  to say to you today. And I hope it gets out quickly, because                  people need to start spiritually interceding now, all over                  the Earth. Because the events are... we only have, now,                  several days. And the events that will be unleashed on Tuesday,                  if we don&rsquo;t avert this, it&rsquo;s going to set a sequence                  of events, like dominoes, in motion, that&rsquo;s gonna result                  in some terrible things.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.
