It is September          9th, 2008, and welcome, David. We&rsquo;re very happy to          be able to chat with you on a live situation here where the          rest of the world is going to be able to listen in.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well,          I&rsquo;m more than happy to jump in. I heard that you guys          had people asking about me and wanting to hear some more          and I&rsquo;m working on a really, really important article          right now and I think that the implications of what I&rsquo;m          putting together are quite intriguing and valuable for many          people to hear.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK,          well we just want to jump right in because we&rsquo;re very          interested in your take on the recent announcements by Benjamin          Fulford and just want to know what you think about the election,          what&rsquo;s going on, ah, October -- we get a lot of stuff          about October -- so just kind of run the gamut, if you will,          and then circle around to your article and what you are going          to put forth.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well,          I&rsquo;ll apologize in advance for the fact that this will          probably, at first, sound like a monologue, but there is          some back story that we need to have in order to have a good          philosophical discussion about this stuff. Is that ok?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Absolutely.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: All          right. There have been some very intriguing developments,          beginning in the field of crop circles, actually; beginning,          of course, earlier this year with a crop formation that very          accurately depicted the number pi using an intelligent cipher          that was able to be decoded by a man in England and it actually          was covered on Fox News website. It was covered on a couple          of English websites and got to be quite a big media sensation. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What a          lot of people didn&rsquo;t notice was that this formation          had a ratcheting appearance to it, which was very similar          to my all-time-favorite crop formation -- which is also the          favorite of many others -- Barbury Castle, 1991. This is          a formation that Richard Hoagland wrote about extensively          in his book, <em>Monuments of Mars</em>, because it encoded          the geometry of a tetrahedron, which is a pyramid type object          made of four sides with equilateral triangles on each side. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it looks          like a pyramid except the bottom is a triangle. And then          you stick that inside a sphere and Hoagland&rsquo;s research          into physics, which has been supported by others including          -- going all the way back to some of the turn-of-the-century          physicists, including Maxwell -- is that when you have a          gravitating body of large size, like the planet Earth or          any other planet, that there&rsquo;s natural energy upwellings          as the body rotates, which are formed by geometry. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that          sounds kind of dry and academic until you realize that the          Great Red Spot on Jupiter is at precisely this geometrically-defined          point. It&rsquo;s been sitting there for 400 years rotating.          As far as we know it&rsquo;s been there the whole time. We          see, on solid planets, instead of these giant hurricane-like          storms, we see gigantic volcanoes. In fact, the Hawaiian          Island chain is at this geometric point on Earth, and on          Mars, you have a mountain called <em>Olympus Mons</em>, which is a          volcano that&rsquo;s three times taller than Mt. Everest.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Aren&rsquo;t          we talking about 19.5?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: 19.5,          that&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s either 19.5 degrees north          or south of the Equator; if you fix one of the points of          the tetrahedron to either the north or south rotational pole.          And, again, this would all just be an interesting academic          exercise, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that, in the 1991          crop formation was laid down, which actually diagramed in          very precise geometric language how this works. And what          was interesting was that, that was only the middle of the          formation; on the edge of each point on the triangle was          a little circle formation, and the first one was intended          to be a dot inside a circle, which kind of represents like          the first dimension. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second          one was a series of spiraling lines coming out from a center          going to the outside, which kind of represents the second          dimension in which the point in the middle of the sphere          in the first diagram becomes a rotation in the second diagram          and then, the third diagram, you get this ratcheting thing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third          circle on the outside of this triangle becomes a ratcheting          shape, which actually looks like a pyramid. It&rsquo;s a          4-sided square, which kind of collapses in on itself in a          spiral. It&rsquo;s easier to see the picture and it&rsquo;ll          be on my article when I publish it tonight, which is on <a href="https://www.divinecosmos.com" target="_blank">www.divinecosmos.com</a>,          my website.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All this          stuff is going to be there. Anyway, so it looks like there&rsquo;s          a progression of dimensions. You have the 1st dimension;          2nd dimension; 3rd dimension and then the 4th dimension,          of course, would be the inside of the diagram, where you          get this tetrahedron-inside-the-sphere thing. And so it was          like a giant infomercial in the crops for Richard Hoagland&rsquo;s          theory, and then, what happens is this year, you get the          same type of ratcheting formation, only this time it&rsquo;s          encoding pi, which, of course, is that irrational number          that&rsquo;s created when you take a circle and you define          the diameter as the number 1 and then the circumference of          the circle is a number that cannot be resolved within our          3-dimensional mathematics. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s          why the pi has an infinite number of decimals, because you          can&rsquo;t actually calculate it if you make the diameter          1. Anyway, it&rsquo;s believed that, in a higher-dimensional          framework, pi actually resolves to a single number with          NO decimal points and that&rsquo;s when you get into all          this multidimensional stuff. So, suffice it to say that crop          circles got more publicity than ever this year as a result          of that shape being decoded and published in all these mainstream          media sources. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not too          long after that, there was another formation that came down,          which actually gives, in no uncertain terms, an exact diagram          of where the planets in the Solar System will be as of December          21, 2012, which is the end of the Mayan Calendar and, of          course, the date that is massively speculated upon. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are          2 different feature studio films coming out about 2012, one          of which is by Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay -- the guy          that did <em>Transformers</em> and the guy that did <em>The          Day After Tomorrow</em>. There&rsquo;s another one coming          out from Nickelodeon. It&rsquo;s actually a KIDS' movie based          on 2012 and the apocalypse, if you can believe that. And          we also know -- you, all 3 of us in this conversation --          know that there are multiple witnesses from inside the black          ops community that have portended what usually appears to          be quite a cataclysmic type of event in 2012. You have ... I&rsquo;m          forgetting the guy&rsquo;s name, who was the intuitive communicator          and was ... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ...                    Clifford Stone?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well,          he&rsquo;s one of them, but the guy that devised that method          of communication because they told him that...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ...                    Dan Sherman?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: ...

That after 2012, there would be no electromagnetic          means of communication and he devised these other means which          they taught him how to do telepathically; and, of course,          yeah, Clifford Stone, same thing; Dan Burisch -- who all          three of us have had extensive communication with -- same          thing; Henry Deacon -- who all three of us have been in contact          with -- same thing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we          keep seeing the same information over and over again. In          fact, I just asked Henry this morning if I had his permission          to go public with the fact that he and I have had extensive          communication; he actually announced that in your forum --          so now that&rsquo;s out of the bag. Anyway, the point is,          is that there was not just one 2012 formation, there were          actually two and, in the 2nd one a series of dates were given,          not just 2012. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the          date that has consistently been shown the most, and this          is over the course of at least 6 different crop circles that          appeared in this year&rsquo;s season, the date that was consistently          flagged the most was August 16, 2008. During which time there          was a lunar eclipse over Europe, which would encompass approximately          87% of the moon&rsquo;s face by the shadow of the earth as          it&rsquo;s occulted between the sun and the moon. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what          happens is you have this eclipse and, traditionally speaking,          eclipses are associated with the fall of kings. They&rsquo;re          associated with major political changes on the planet, particularly          when they act to potentiate existing energies that are already          quite tense. Now I was looking at these prophecies. I was          aware of them as early as the 2nd week of July. I did not          wish to go public with them, because I felt what would happen          is that others would jump on it and try to make it into something          more than it was. I didn&rsquo;t know what the answer would          be; however, there were some very intriguing clues. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of          the formations that flagged August 16th as an exact timeline          was actually drawn directly next to a series of windmills          that are used to generate wind power -- electricity from          the wind &ndash; which, of course, is alternative energy,          which, of course, could very well be the circle makers saying          to us, <em>OK, check it out. Whatever happens on August 16th          is going to be a major step towards eliminating the dependence          that you have on oil and freeing up the possibility of alternative          forms of energy</em> and, when you look at this confirmation,          which, again, I will have all these pictures up on my site          and we can mirror this on <a href="https://www.ProjectAvalon.net">www.ProjectAvalon.net</a>,          which is you guys&rsquo; new site as well, so everybody can          see this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You&rsquo;re          going to see what appear to be 3 sets of gears with teeth          on them, clearly showing that this is intended to be some          sort of machine, some sort of functional machine that they&rsquo;re          flagging. So you have the suggestion of a machine; it&rsquo;s          built next to a row of 4 giant windmills that generate electricity,          and the date that they&rsquo;re flagging, again, is August          16th. And there&rsquo;s, like, 6 different formations doing          this date. So I&rsquo;m going, <em>what the hell is going          on here?</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then I          go off to ... oh, and that&rsquo;s not all. I was working          on a paper with Richard Hoagland insofar as he submitted          it to me to read and to see if I had any suggestions as to          information I might want to add to it. And this paper dealt          with the very beginning of NASA involving Wernher von Braun,          who was essentially a Nazi German scientist transferred over          here after World War II by our guys in the U.S., who was          then made to be a very public role in basically acclimating          American people to what&rsquo;s going on in the space program. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in          fact, he had a great deal of rocketry experience by designing          the V2 rockets in Germany and was not only the public relations          face, but was also a very important scientist in terms of          actually developing rocket technology, which would ultimately          lean towards trying to do a moon shot, trying to get a man          on the moon. Well in the early days they were launching off          a bunch of rockets and, in the process, many of them -- almost          all of them, in fact -- were not following their projected          path as it had been given. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other          words, we were using the conventional Newtonian Physics:                    <em>Force = Mass x Acceleration</em>; and all the basic rules of how          we believe the planets and moons and so forth orbit. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And nothing          was working out right. There was some sort of mysterious          force that was skewing the rockets so that they were actually          overshooting the target -- it was as if something was lifting          them. They were getting an extra source of lift that was          causing them to fly higher and go farther than they normally          should have. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Richard          did a prodigious amount of work in exposing all this stuff.          In this 2-part article series, I believe it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Von          Braun&rsquo;s 50-Year-Old Secret&rdquo;. Anyway, that&rsquo;s          on his website, <a href="https://www.EnterpriseMission.com" target="_blank">www.enterprisemission.com</a>.          Now it was on the night of, ah, well, he sent me this work          as of, I guess, August 5th to review, because, obviously,          we want to have our own form of peer review, since we are          peers and we do know things that the other doesn&rsquo;t          know. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I hadn&rsquo;t          had a chance to look at it and then he sent me the graphic          he was going to use to put on the front page of the website          and it was a picture of von Braun holding out his hand in          front of a diagram of the Earth and the Moon and the orbital          path between them, which kind of looks like half of an infinity          loop. Anyway, I look at this diagram and I say, <em>Richard,          I can make this look a lot sexier than that. I want to make          this really pop out and do this for you.</em> And so he naturally          agreed. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So on the          night of August 7th, I finished the diagram in which -- what          I did is I put in a moon on the top right, I put in a star          field behind the moon, and then I drew a figure 8 infinity          loop between the Earth and the Moon, so as to illustrate          the path that the rockets would go on the way to the Moon.          And I also used a comical image of the Moon: I found an image          where there was a rocket stuck in the eyeball of the Moon,          as if the man on the Moon had been stuck in the eye with          the rocket. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so          it had some comedy in it, because, of course, it was a black          eye on the face of NASA that these mistakes were happening,          because time after time they&rsquo;re spending multimillion          dollars on these rockets, and then they&rsquo;re blowing          up, and they&rsquo;re not reaching their targets and it was          very embarrassing. This was in the &lsquo;50s that this was          happening. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Richard&rsquo;s          conclusion, of course, is that there&rsquo;s an antigravity          force that was skewing the launch pattern of the rockets,          which is the key to antigravity. He does not believe that          von Braun knew about this before or, if he did, he certainly          didn&rsquo;t know how it worked well enough to be able to          alter the rockets&rsquo; path to make it work. So anyway,          this was the key that could have led to free energy and antigravity          and all these wonderful things, but, instead, they had to          adapt over multiple failed launches in order to eventually          figure out how to correctly launch rockets and take these          forces into account. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now in          the meantime I&rsquo;m sitting here working on this diagram          and the key thing that was the most difficult was this figure-8          infinity loop that I was trying to superimpose between the          Earth and the Moon. And I&rsquo;d gotten this off of just          a website that had a series of infinity shapes on it. The          original infinity shape was a uniform line all the way around.          It was like if you drew a number 8 but the line was even          in its width all the way across. And I had gotten it all          the way to where I wanted it and then my computer crashed          and I had to start over. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I&rsquo;d          had so much trouble with the fatter infinity symbol that          I went with a skinnier one, where on one side, it was wide          and on the other side, it was skinny. So it looks more like          a conventional number 8 that would be drawn in like Times          New Roman font, or something. Anyway, I popped this in there          and, while I&rsquo;m doing this, I have this thought in my          mind that says, <em>You know, I wonder if the circle makers          -- the guys that are doing the crop circles, whoever they          are -- would respond to my thoughts and make a circle based          on what I&rsquo;m thinking about right now</em>, because,          as we know in crop circle history, back in 1991, a group          of people meditated and thought, in August 1991, about the          Mandelbrot Set , which is a fractal pattern that many of          us are familiar with and the very next day a crop formation          showed up that had that pattern in the crop. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I just,          I didn&rsquo;t want to take, I didn&rsquo;t want to be arrogant,          I didn&rsquo;t want to ask for something, it just was a stray          thought that went through my mind, but I had intent behind          it. I said, <em>That would be really cool if a crop formation          was made based on what I&rsquo;m thinking about</em>. Well,          the very next day was 8/8/8. August 8th, 2008 and, lo and          behold, there shows up in the crops a gigantic infinity symbol.          Skinnier on the one side, fatter on the other side, exactly          like the one that I had just posted on to Richard Hoagland&rsquo;s          webpage the night before in the art that I had done as we          posted this article about von Braun, the Nazis, the 1950s,          the secret space program, all this kind of stuff that&rsquo;s          going on behind the scenes. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I found          this very fascinating. I didn&rsquo;t do anything with it          at the time. Then I go off, that same weekend, to this dowsing          conference in Vermont. Dowsing is where people use a stick          to find water in the ground. And they wanted me to be their          keynote speaker. There was, like, 500 people at the conference,          it was very well attended and my father was there, he loved          what I said. It was a family healing, a lot of good things          happened but, here I am in the airport and I&rsquo;m reading          about Russia and Georgia at war. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That basically,          the spin was that, Russia created an unprovoked attack against          Georgia; whereas, the deeper reality was that Saakashvilli,          however you pronounce his name, the President of Georgia,          had basically launched an unprovoked, spontaneous attack          against innocent civilians in the capital city of South Ossetia,          which is this breakaway republic that had been a part of          Georgia and was now claiming allegiance to Russia. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So he basically          bombs these people and what nobody had prepared for -- this          is what the insider disclosures have now revealed -- what          nobody had prepared for was that Russia knew about it in          advance, had secret knowledge that they were about to do          this, had disguised all their equipment, so that nobody saw          that it was waiting there, even though they had shot down          various airplanes that were in flight when they flew over          that airspace, they still didn&rsquo;t figure it out. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Georgians          and, also, you got to remember that there were war games          exercises going on between the U.S. and Israel in collusion          with Georgia. There was a huge contingent of CIA., black          ops, military personnel -- all these folks in Georgia. Because          what they were planning on doing, this is what we now find          out, is using Georgia as a staging area from which Israeli          planes would bomb Iran. And this was also involved in the          Israeli faction trying to get McCain to allow Lieberman to          be his Vice Presidential nominee. There was heavy, heavy          pressure for him to do that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And McCain          had actually promised them, so these inside sources say,          that he would, in fact bomb Iran, like, very soon, and hence          you saw him in that video where he goes, where he&rsquo;s          making fun of that song <em>Barbara Ann</em> and he&rsquo;s          saying <em>bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran</em>, you know. So what&rsquo;s          happened is, I&rsquo;m going off to this dowsing conference          -- all of a sudden, we&rsquo;re at war. If you look it up,          they say the war starts somewhere between August 7th and          August 8th and it lasts for 8 days. Well what&rsquo;s 8 +          8? ... 16. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What&rsquo;s          August 16th? The very day that at least 6 or 7 -- well at          least 6 crop formations &ndash; flagged; the day of an eclipse;          the day in which, where a crop formation was equated with          these four windmills. The idea that we&rsquo;re going to get          off of the oil tit and on to some sort of real energy that&rsquo;s            actually going to be much healthier for the environment and                    won&rsquo;t require us to have to fight over diminishing                    resources. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what&rsquo;s                    happened is the Russians were involved, they had pre-existing                    knowledge, they were shooting down Israeli fighter jets when                    they flew over the airspace and they still went ahead and                    did the invasion anyway. There were CIA personnel on hand.                    Nobody foresaw that Russia was going to fight back like this.                    Because it was right in the middle of the beginning of the                    Olympics, if you remember that, nobody wanted to have an                    international incident when everybody&rsquo;s together in                    Beijing for the Olympics. And yet, all of a sudden, chaos                    starts to ensue. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now again,                    the original plan was that Russia wouldn&rsquo;t have a fast                    response. That this would quickly escalate into a big World                    War III type of situation and that, in the melee, they would                    be able to find an excuse to bomb Iran and make it ok. Nobody                    prepared for the fact that Russia was standing by and just                    blasted the hell out of Georgia, ripped the country in half                    and completely demolished the military. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, this                    guy, who&rsquo;s been in the White House for years now, coming                    out with advanced information, well in advance of when we                    actually see it in the media; it&rsquo;s published on a website,                    which is <em>The Barnes Review</em> &ndash; TBR: it&rsquo;s                    the initials <a href="https://www.TBRNews.org">www.TBRNews.org</a>.                    You read &ldquo;Voice of the Whitehouse; you go into the                    archive on that site. You can read all these disclosures;                    they come out about every Wednesday and every Saturday, pretty                    consistently. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    has been the most reliable and consistent intel source I&rsquo;ve                    ever seen as far as politics. This guy makes it very clear                    that a massive war was planned and that Georgia was what                    was supposed to start it and it didn&rsquo;t work. And, it&rsquo;s                    even worse than that -- worse for them, because the Russians                    drove out the CIA. They literally ran out of there, they                    were so scared because such amazing military force was brought                    down upon them so quickly that they literally just ran. And                    they didn&rsquo;t have the time to do any of the exfiltration                    techniques that they normally would use to leave an area                    without having blueprints and footprints behind. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what&rsquo;s                    happened is Russia has now come into possession of a treasure                    trove of incriminating documents and materials, which totally                    lay bare the collusion between the U.S. and Israel, the plans                    for the empire, global empire; the plans for World War III;                    the plans for internment camps; FEMA camps -- all this kind                    of crap. All the documents are now in the hands of the Russians                    and they are in the process of getting ready to release all                    this stuff. And TBRNews is going to be one of the main sources                    that it comes through, thanks to this one guy, Brian Harring.                    So this is not a joke, you guys. This stuff is real. This                    is what happens, yeah?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:                    I wondered if I could interrupt you there...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Absolutely.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: This                    is fascinating to listen to this very articulate account.                    It completely agrees with everything that I understand so                    I have no issue at all with any of your information.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Something                    which I had wondered earlier and I wondered if you had wondered                    this as well. I just wanted to knock this around between                    us. Earlier on, when Putin did his unprecedented interview                    with CNN, why do you think he didn&rsquo;t come cleaner with                    more startling information? Is it he was he was biding his                    time and this is going to come out later. That&rsquo;s my                    question.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I think                    you&rsquo;re exactly right. There is a vested interest in                    not tipping the hat too early, because what we&rsquo;re really                    dealing with -- and this ties in with Benjamin Fulford&rsquo;s                    testimony and, thus, the thrust of your initial question                    -- is a split in the Nazi party that happened when Hitler                    decided to go against the Rothschilds in World War II. He                    killed everybody in all the Masonic lodges all throughout                    Europe. He literally genocided the Masonic lodges. A lot                    of people don&rsquo;t know this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is                    a website out there -- which is going to be in my article                    -- I think if you Google &ldquo;Scarlet and the Beast&rdquo; <a href="https://www.scarletandthebeast.com" target="_blank">you&rsquo;ll                    find it</a>, but I&rsquo;m                    going to have the links in my article. This man has done                    some really amazing research, which includes the fact that                    Hitler essentially purged all the Masonic lodges, because                    he knew that was the only organization that had sufficient                    secrecy and sufficient motive to be able to organize to bring                    him down. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what                    ends up happening is that Hitler was originally being financed                    by, for lack of a better word, the Illuminati, the Rothschild                    faction of the power elite on this planet. In the attempt                    to try to unify Russia and Europe into a single conglomerate                    nation, so to speak, and thus the effort was to try to go                    for a one-world government by basically conquering all these                    countries and then having alliances. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, Hitler                    was only a puppet. He didn&rsquo;t have real power but, he                    got arrogant and cocky and started to feel that the power                    that he&rsquo;d been extended as a puppet was actually real.                    I mean, after all he did command the armies. Everybody --                    most people -- thought he was in charge. So why not take                    the power as being yours? I mean, he got to the point where                    he says, <em>What can they do? What can they do to stop me?</em> So                    there was  ...  </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: It&rsquo;s                    a little like George Bush.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh yeah,                    totally, totally. So what happened is, there was a split                    in which Hitler went off on his own and it&rsquo;s actually                    not very well known, but highly well documented and I&rsquo;ll                    have this in my article as well, that U.S. corporations in                    large numbers were supporting the Nazi party. And this includes                    Boeing, who was actually making the bombers. They would have                    passenger airliners that they shipped to South America and                    then they would ship them to Africa, where the seats were                    ripped out and the decals were put on them and they were                    turned into the Wehrmacht bombing fleets. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then you                    have the tank plants in Germany that were built by Ford Motor                    Company and General Motors and, when Allied bombers destroyed                    the tank plants, Ford personally repaid Hitler to rebuild                    these tank plants. So it&rsquo;s treason at a level that                    is unimaginable to the average person who doesn&rsquo;t understand                    that this whole thing is just a big game.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Also                    George Bush Senior, you have to think about the Bush family                    and their whole  ... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I&rsquo;m                    getting there, I&rsquo;m getting there. In 1933 Prescott                    Bush, who was a financier of the Nazi party -- in fact one                    of the largest bankers for the Nazi party in the U.S. In                    1933 he drew up a plan to engage a fascist coup in the U.S.                    similar to what Mussolini was doing in Italy and Hitler was                    doing in Germany because he believed it was the best way                    to stabilize the economy in the aftermath of the depression.                    The plan was to oust Franklin Delano Roosevelt and essentially                    take over the country with military force. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The BBC,                    if you can believe it, and I have the links in the article                    you&rsquo;ll see, the BBC actually did investigative reporting                    on this, complete with a radio show, confirming that it&rsquo;s                    true; including this General from the U.S., who actually                    defected and went against the plan and blew the whistle on                    it. And there was a Congressional inquiry and it was stopped;                    but, yet it was very hush, hush and nothing ever went anywhere,                    because these guys commanded a fierce, terrifying amount                    of power. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, again,                    when you&rsquo;re dealing with the global elite, there&rsquo;re                    two primary negative factions that have been warring with                    each other ever since the beginning of the 20th century.                    And it goes like this: the Rothschilds created the Rockefeller                    oil empire. John D. Rockefeller was financed by the Rothschild&rsquo;s.                    They said, <em>Go to America, which we don&rsquo;t want to                    be there, you go over there and you start this oil empire                    and work with us</em>. They did not see -- this is part of                    their lack of foresight -- they did not see that oil would                    become the predominant economic force in the world. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What happened                    was the Rockefellers were able to amass power, so as the                    U.S., in the Rockefeller faction, began secretly financing                    Hitler&rsquo;s regime. Hitler himself actually veered away                    from the Rothschilds and more towards the Rockefeller faction.                    And thus, in the aftermath of World War II and collapse of                    the Nazi party, when the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers                    turned against Hitler because he basically was loyal to no                    one but himself, a good portion of Hitler&rsquo;s war machine                    was imported to the U.S. via Project Paperclip, which was                    a program that Congress justified by saying, <em>If we don&rsquo;t                    get these scientists, then the Russians are going to get                    them, so we gotta bring them here</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well not                    only did they bring over their science, like with von Braun                    and the rocketry, they also brought over all this other garbage                    like these ritual occult stuff, torture techniques that were                    intended to create partitions in the mind for purposes of                    mind control, which led to the Monarch Mind Control Program,                    and not to mention all of the tools to manipulate a free                    society into a fascist dictatorship, which various researchers                    -- including this woman named Naomi Wolf -- have asserted                    is exactly what&rsquo;s happened. In fact the neoconservative                    Bush administration has essentially followed Hitler&rsquo;s                    playbook right down to the letter. In fact the phrasing like &ldquo;Homeland                    Security&rdquo; is very similar to what the German&rsquo;s                    called &ldquo;Fatherland&rdquo;. And it just goes on and                    on and on.

So anyway,                    this is all back-story to establish that two essential factions,                    both of which are negative, were established. And the Rothschild                    faction has always been much more involved with ritual magic                    and the occult. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rothschild                    faction has a spiritual belief that Lucifer is actually the                    good guy and that the Christian pantheon threw him out because                    they were the bad guys.

And that&rsquo;s why, when you go into the Book of                    Revelation and you&rsquo;re reading about the Antichrist,                    it doesn&rsquo;t say 666 is the number. It actually says <em>six                    hundred, three score thirty, and six.</em> And before that                    little passage, it says, <em>for he who hath ears, let him                    hear.</em> Now, for anybody who&rsquo;s a cabbalist, meaning                    somebody who knows the secret magical tradition, when it                    says that little phrase<em>, for he who hath ears, let him                    hear</em>, it means take the numerical value of each letter                    and add &lsquo;em up, and the number that you get from this                    passage is the secret code. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So when                    you add up the passage that describes the Antichrist and                    the number of the beast as being 666, the number it adds                    up to is 3160. And that number, in the secret code, is Lord                    Jesus Christ. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what                    this -- and I know it&rsquo;s going to sound crazy, but you                    can read all this in a book by John Michell, called <a href="https://amazon.com/Dimensions-Paradise-Geometry-Ancient-Heavenly/dp/1594771987" target="_blank">The                    Dimensions of Paradise</a>.                    And when you actually go through the account of the Antichrist                    in the Bible, what it says is that the Antichrist would be <em>wounded                    on the side and yet did live and fashioned into an idol to                    be worshipped by all peoples, in nations, of all tongues. </em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there                    is nothing else we see in the world except mainstream fundamentalist                    Christianity that fits that. So, they knew. They knew that                    the original positive message of Jehoshua (which is actually                    the real name of Jesus, bastardized into the name Jesus)  ...  Jehoshua&rsquo;s                    teachings were positive. They taught service to others. They                    said, <em>love thy neighbor</em>. They didn&rsquo;t say,                    love thy neighbor, provided that he&rsquo;s not a faggot,                    or that he&rsquo;s not  ...  </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know,                    I use that derogatory term for a reason, because these guys                    have totally lost touch with the Golden Rule. As long as                    you&rsquo;re not a gay, as long as you&rsquo;re not having                    an abortion, as long as you don&rsquo;t oppose your country                    invading other countries, then you&rsquo;re <em>God&rsquo;s                    chosen</em>. Well, that&rsquo;s totally negative and everybody                    sees that now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it was                    seen long in advance that you were going to have this faction                    that would emerge, that would use the name of Christianity                    to do unspeakable acts of evil. And this is exactly what&rsquo;s                    happened.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: The                    Neocons.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: The                    Neocons. That&rsquo;s right. They are the fulfillment of                    the Christian prophecy, encoded in the Bible through Gematria,                    which is the science of adding up numbers out of the letters,                    in which the Antichrist passage adds up to 3160, which translates                    as Lord Jesus Christ. And they use that term because Jesus                    didn&rsquo;t want to be named a &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t                    want to be seen as better than anyone else. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the                    Bible he keeps saying, I&rsquo;m the son of Man. I&rsquo;m                    not the son of God. I&rsquo;m the son of Man. But there&rsquo;s                    all that stuff that he was trying to do. And he tried to                    make it really simple: Love your neighbor. And then it got                    all contorted into what we see now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Masons,                      anti-Illuminati</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, all                    that aside, the Illuminati faction is the result of the conglomerate                    of different secret societies that would keep kind of fading                    out and dying out and then resurging when people would rediscover                    them  ...  one of these people being, of course, Francis                    Bacon, who is the author of the Free Masonic tradition. Most                    of those rites and rituals came from him. He also apparently                    was keenly involved in the rewrite of the Bible by King James,                    which we call the King James Version. So that&rsquo;s another                    feather in the cap of the Illuminati , that their founder                    basically rewrote the Bible.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they                    also, of course, have all the Shakespearian plays which  ...  Francis                    Bacon took on the pseudonym of &ldquo;William Shakespeare&rdquo;,                    which is a cabbala meaning: &ldquo;Shake the spear of the                    will of the I AM presence.&rdquo; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the                    real William Shakespeare was a guy who was totally illiterate.                    He couldn&rsquo;t even sign his own name. He couldn&rsquo;t                    even write. And when he died, they didn&rsquo;t find any                    books in his house. And yet after he died, posthumously,                    there were many, many books, many, many plays published and                    given his name. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So there                    was a whole team of people writing the Shakespearean plays.                    Bacon was in charge of it. He was able to use the plays to                    disclose a lot of royal scandals that couldn&rsquo;t go out                    in the public, because the secret of Bacon is that he was                    the illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth. Queen Elizabeth                    was pregnant by Lord Dudley, who was unpopular, and, therefore,                    she could not make him her King. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Bacon                    was raised by one of her maids-in-waiting. And he didn&rsquo;t                    even realize until he got to be a teenager that Elizabeth                    was his mother. So, in the process, he gets this Oedipal                    Complex and falls in love with his mother. And then realizes                    that she <em>is</em> his mother and that odious realization                    is either the plot of <em>Macbeth</em> or <em>Hamlet</em>,                    or one of the most famous ones. I forget which. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But all                    of this stuff that was in those plays was actually blowing                    the whistle on real scandals in the royalty. So Francis Bacon                    became very estranged by the royalty. He was thrown out of                    England by his mother. He was highly betrayed by her. He                    was horrified. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yet                    he was given access to the Vatican library, which, of course,                    poached the library of Alexandria, and things from the Mayan                    codices, and all the secret stuff going all the way back                    to Atlantis that we&rsquo;re not supposed to know, or that                    they don&rsquo;t want us to know. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A                      New Atlantis</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, Bacon                    discovers that there were plans from Atlantean prophecies                    to create a new Atlantis. And they even said where it would                    be, that it would be this undiscovered land in the western                    hemisphere, which they didn&rsquo;t even know to exist. So                    he found maps of the Earth, secret maps, that showed the                    American continents.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was                    able to secretly inspire the nautical expeditions of the                    conquerors and fooled the people into ... telling them that                    there were streets of gold, paved with gold, that even they                    were pissing and shitting into gold pots, to try to get people                    to want to go over there. Because, in fact, he realized that                    there was this great prophecy that America was going to be                    the new Atlantis, and it needed his help to fulfill the prophecy. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So America                    was always intended by Bacon and by the Masons to be the                    location where they would stage this massive effort to overthrow                    the world and make a New World Order, which was his ultimate                    goal. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, he                    was anti-royalty. So what they did is, they created their                    own secret society based on all these ancient rites that                    had been lost. And they created all the secret handshakes                    and all the rituals and the loyalty oaths where they say,                    you know, <em>if you blow the whistle on us, we&rsquo;ll                    kill you,</em> and then basically set up shop, eventually.                    It took 300 years, but they moved everything over to the                    US.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    the Rothschilds  ... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: They                    also infiltrated the Vatican.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh yeah.                    Absolutely. That&rsquo;s absolutely true. That goes  ...  you                    know, there&rsquo;re several different levels of testimony                    that say that, including Svali, the Illuminati whistleblower;                    Leo Zagami, who you guys interviewed, and others. Greg Szymanski                    brought in a number of people to talk about that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyway,                    what happens is, Francis Bacon and the creation of the Masonic                    Order was the beginning of the division against the Rothschilds,                    who actually were in charge of the ancient royalty that was                    still running, you know, right of succession, bloodline stuff,                    Royal Right of Kings, in these European countries. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    Masonic Order wanted to break off from that and create a                    fraternal organization that wasn&rsquo;t based on any sort                    of ancient bloodline, which is very anti-Illuminati, which                    is all about the bloodline. So they eventually set up shop                    in the US. The original founding fathers were all Masons,                    of course. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then                    what happens is, the Rothschild faction starts to infiltrate                    very soon after America was created. In fact, the War of                    1812 was the result of the US side, the Masonic side, trying                    to throw off the yoke of the Illuminati. And the King of                    England was so pissed off about it that he made a hasty attempt                    to try to take it back. And it was this failed war that resulted. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, as                    you go forward in time, you now have the American Masonic                    party being one faction, against the Illuminati being the                    other faction. They rejected all the Luciferian blood-drinking                    occult rituals. Now, granted, they do have Bohemian Grove.                    They do have some of these sacramental things that they go                    through, which are more ceremonial. But they&rsquo;re nowhere                    near as into it as the Rothschild side is.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But                    I have to interject here, that there is a split within the                    Rockefeller faction ... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh,                    no doubt about it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:  ...                    and a major one that involves MJ-12 or, as they want to be                    called today, the Committee of the Majority, or whatever.                    And there&rsquo;s                    a major war going on between them, within those                    two factions.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That&rsquo;s                    absolutely correct. What I&rsquo;m trying to do right now                    is paint out the picture of the last few hundred years of                    history so that, when we get to that point, we&rsquo;ll be                    able to have that discussion. Again, I apologize that this                    a monologue, but I think most people will find this fascinating. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: No.                    You&rsquo;re doing a great job.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: So,                    this is the result of extensive research that I&rsquo;ve                    done, as you can probably tell. Anyway, what happens is,                    a very significant series of political events occurred, beginning                    in  ...  1826, I believe, is when it started, somewhere                    in that neighborhood. It will be in the article, in probably                    part 2 or part 3 of the article. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But anyway,                    the American Masonry grew quite large. You got favored treatment                    in business. If you were on the battlefield and you gave                    the Masonic great hailing signal of distress, which is a                    gesture followed with a verbal statement that you make, then                    soldiers would rush to your aid. Even if somebody else was                    in the way, you would get saved first. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it gave                    you the advantage in war. It gave you the advantage in business.                    Gave you advantage socially. You could be lent money from                    the Masonic Order and you would be protected against being                    brought to trial even if you had committed a crime. Your                    crimes would be covered up. So this was very attractive to                    a lot of people. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yet                    the Rothschild side was infiltrating and the efforts grew                    to the point where the Civil War was constructed. I&rsquo;m                    sorry ...  that&rsquo;s getting ahead of ourselves. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Masonic                      Revolt</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before                    we get to that, there was a very important Masonic revolt,                    which is a very key element of American history, which has                    been totally scrubbed from the textbooks because of the Masonic                    influence still wielding as much power as it does. It&rsquo;s                    very important to discuss this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A man named                    William Morgan, in the late 1820s, decided that he was not                    comfortable with Free Masonry because it went against his                    Christian beliefs. He had ascended to the 3rd degree of Masonry,                    which  ...  the first three degrees are called the <em>Blue                    Degrees</em>, where you don&rsquo;t really know very much.                    And he actually went out and published all this stuff and                    put it out in a book. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, because                    he betrayed the Masonic Order, they were required by their                    oath to kill him. And they did. They actually tied a bunch                    of rocks to a series of ropes around his waist and basically                    dropped him over the edge of the boat in the middle of the                    Niagara River and he drowned. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what                    happened was, the people who committed this murder, even                    though they knew that it was part of their oath that they                    had agreed to, they didn&rsquo;t like what happened, and                    they began to talk about it and they began to publicize it.                    And by this point, you already had the Masonic Order having                    a stranglehold over the means of publication, of media, in                    the country. So it was very difficult for this word to get                    around. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But back                    then, you didn&rsquo;t really have established corporate                    newspapers and so forth, and mail was brought by Pony Express                    and those kinds of methods. And in the early 1820s, 1830s,                    you still didn&rsquo;t even really have railroad transportation                    yet. All you really had was horse and buggy, so it wasn&rsquo;t  ...  it                    took a while for these things to get around. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what                    ended up happening was, a massive social revolution took                    place. And of 50,000 members in the Masonic Order in colonial                    America, 40,000 of them quit and virtually all the Masonic                    lodges in the north part of the country disbanded. Only a                    very few number in the South actually even stayed operational. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there                    was actually a party called the Anti-Masonic Party, which                    you can look up in Wikipedia, that was formed, which included                    some very heavy-hitting names in American history that were                    a member of this party. And that party later evolved into                    a party called the <em>Whigs</em>, and most people are more                    familiar with that, if you remember from history classes                    in school. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But anyway,                    what happens is, it actually gets to the point that there                    were open hearings on a very high governmental level, in                    New York and other states, about the Masonic Order, and they                    tried to bring the whole thing down. And they were largely                    successful. It only held on in the South. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The                      Civil War</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what                    did the Rothschilds do next? It took &lsquo;em a number of                    years, but they fomented the Civil War, using slavery as                    the bait, even though both the North and the South were involved                    in it. That was the ticket that they used. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lincoln                    was essentially a pawn. He didn&rsquo;t realize the full                    extent of what was going on, and they shot him when he started                    to figure out what was happening and didn&rsquo;t want to                    go along with the plan anymore. That&rsquo;s why Lincoln                    was assassinated. Lincoln&rsquo;s actions  ...  inadvertently                    he was pawned into creating the federal government as we                    now know it, taking away the rights of the States and federalizing                    the American government much more than it ever had been before. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So at this                    time in history the Civil War as actually fomented in order                    to boost membership into the Masonic Order, which by this                    point the Rothschild faction was starting to infiltrate.                    And that&rsquo;s also where you start to get the break between                    Yorkies and Scotties -- York Rite and Scottish Rite Masonry. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Essentially                    what happens is, the Civil War massively restructured the                    Masonic Order. The lodges all got rebuilt in the North and                    the South because, basically, soldiers didn&rsquo;t want                    to die in battle, and they knew that if they were a member                    of this group, they would be given preferential treatment                    to stay alive. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The                      Federal Reserve</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, nonetheless,                    the American faction, versus the Rothschild faction, still                    won out and had the prevailing influence. And this continued                    right up until the formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913,                    which was a dodgy deceptive move that Fulford talks about,                    which lead to the creation of a fiat form of currency in                    which speculative hot air is used to back up the dollar.                    It was originally put on the gold standard but even that                    was being manipulated and now there&rsquo;s no gold standard.                    And that Federal Reserve is actually run by the Rothschild                    faction. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the                    meantime, they were cooperating with the US enough to establish                    Rockefeller and his oil empire. And that oil empire became                    the driving economic force of this country, which sort of                    became the focal point for all these secret societies and                    the Masonic side of things to focus around  ...  and the                    seat of power. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>World                      War I</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, what                    then happens is, as you develop into World War I, you have                    the Rothschild faction trying to seize world power. You have                    the American faction working against them. This is the basis                    of the conflict: are two groups in war, trying to stop each                    other from doing what they&rsquo;re doing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Hitler,                      World War II</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And of                    course it didn&rsquo;t take long before World War I had devastated                    Germany. German Marks were so cheap that people were carting &lsquo;em                    around in wheelbarrows just to try to get a loaf of bread. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Hitler                    was able to rise up in the middle of this collapsed economy                    and create fascism, which people initially supported, because                    they wanted to go against whoever they felt was responsible                    for bankrupting them. Hitler painted it up as if it was the                    Jews&rsquo; fault. So then he got people to be angry at the                    Jews, just like the Bush administration gets us to be angry                    at the Arabs. So in fact the people did support, to some                    degree, the attack of the Jews. I don&rsquo;t think most                    people would have supported genocide if they knew that&rsquo;s                    what was happening. But they certainly were blaming the Jews                    for what horrible economic hardships they endured.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, it                    comes to be the point in World War II, the fallout of World                    War II, that the Rothschilds lost because Hitler turned against                    them and the US. He became his own separate agent. And he                    basically as doing whatever he wanted and tried to make the                    world his way. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So actually                    the US and the Rothschild side, the Rockefeller and Rothschild                    side, banded up against him -- the enemy of my enemy is my                    friend, so to speak &ndash; and brought him down. And the                    way they got to bring him down was, they got him to march                    on Russia in winter, Stalingrad, exactly, the city. And his                    army completely starved to death in the cold winter, and                    ran out of supplies, and he just destroyed his entire army. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they                    were able to tweak his ego and get him to do this because                    they had broken his code. They knew where he was going to                    go and what he was going to do. And Winston Churchill had                    to allow London to be bombed, even though he had family there.                    And he couldn&rsquo;t telegraph that he knew what was coming,                    because it would have tipped off Hitler to what was going                    on, and they would have lost the war. So that&rsquo;s the                    kind of horrific consequences of knowing the code and not                    being able to go public with it yet.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The                      Anunnaki and the Germans</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So again,                    this is still the history, and what we&rsquo;re getting to                    now is the ET stuff.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Finally.                    I was getting worried there, I have to say.

And, in some form or another,                    this was realized into an open contact between the German,                    budding fascist government, and a group of extraterrestrials                    called the <em>Anunnaki.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now these                    Anunnaki  ...  according to multiple insider testimonies,                    we know that they are approximately twice the height of a                    normal human being. They wear masks. You can&rsquo;t see                    their faces. The protocol is that you are not allowed to                    look in their eyes, even though they have a mask on. And                    their outfits are red and gold in color. They actually look                    kind of comical. It&rsquo;s almost like a battle outfit,                    like something you&rsquo;d see in a video game. And they&rsquo;re <em>huge</em>.                    I mean, they&rsquo;re enormous in size. They&rsquo;re twice                    our height, they&rsquo;re larger than we are, stronger than                    we are. They also have mental powers, telepathy. They can                    control you to some degree, the way you think and what you&rsquo;re                    going to do. And they don&rsquo;t like to be messed with. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So there                    was a period of time in which connection was made between                    Germany and the Anunnaki, which lead to the sharing of technology.                    This began some time in the early-to-mid-1930s and continued                    until sometime in the early-to-mid-1940s. It was well over                    before the end of World War II. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The initial                    meeting apparently took place in the Himalayan Mountains                    -- it had to be a remote area -- between the Germans and                    the Anunnaki. The Anunnaki, again, did share technology with                    the Germans but they only got a small amount. They got some                    antigravity. They got some energy devices, but not a whole                    lot. And so the saucers that they built were fairly crude,                    as a result. However, there was some degree of a sharing                    of power. This is where we get into the New Berlin Base,                    which is actually a base that was an Anunnaki base in Antarctica                    which the Germans were able to cohabitate with them. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rothschild                    faction still shares some degree of communication with the                    Anunnaki. They still are in fairly decent contact with them,                    from what I&rsquo;ve heard. But again, the Rothschild faction                    is vastly inferior when it comes to technology. They don&rsquo;t                    have anywhere near as much stuff as the Rockefeller side. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Roswell                      and the Looking Glass</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    gets into the Roswell crash.

It is a small area of water which has microclusters                    in it. Microclusters are little geometric clusters of minerals.                    And this water is shielded by the surrounding gland, electromagnetically. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And apparently                    the technology is so absurdly simple that all you have to                    do is shield off water from the conventional electromagnetic                    energy that we have in space/time and the water starts to be                    a gate into time/space, which is a realm in which time is                    just a direction you can point yourself in and travel through.                    And it&rsquo;s an inversion of space, so that space becomes                    time and time becomes space.

So, it kind of looks like a fisheye lens. It&rsquo;s                    sort of distorted around the edges. It&rsquo;s not clear                    on the edges, and it&rsquo;s amber-colored because you&rsquo;re                    using argon gas as the sort of like, the equivalent of like                    a neon light, to capture the light that shoots through this                    little barrel in the center. The barrel, again, is based                    on the pineal gland. All it is is a barrel of water which                    is electromagnetically shielded.

We have                  some diagrams of that which had been drawn by Dan Burisch on                  our site, on which we have a link to those papers.

But there                  is a multiple number of converging testimonies that made this                  case come together for me.

It&rsquo;s about one inch wide around                  the edges.

And, as a result of them also taking captivity of                  a live extraterrestrial, a relationship, a diplomatic relationship,                  was opened up with other human extraterrestrials. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, when                    I say &ldquo;human extraterrestrial,&rdquo; what                  I mean is, according to Deacon&rsquo;s testimony, that you                  have, in Deacon&rsquo;s view, it&rsquo;s somewhere in the neighborhood                  of over 40 races. And, of course, we know from Sgt.

You don&rsquo;t have people with anything other                  than basically smooth faces and smooth skulls. Most of them                  have hair.

In fact, the only group that                  apparently is not represented is black people on Earth. Black                  people on Earth may be indigenous to this planet, and that                  may be partially responsible for some of the racism in these                  occult groups. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don&rsquo;t                    subscribe to that at all [To the racism in the occult groups].                    In fact, if anything, it shows how precious, and special,                    and unique the black people are because they are actually                    the people that Earth made before everybody else was brought                    here. Because there is a large amount of, sort of, drop-offs                    of various races that were brought here pretty much at the                  same time. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At one                    point Henry sent me an article from the BBC showing that                    everybody who&rsquo;s a white person on Earth, with blue                  eyes, traces back to a single ancestor from about 11,000 years                  ago, which is perfectly in accordance with what&rsquo;s in                  a variety of occult teachings. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact,                    Hitler&rsquo;s whole obsession with the so-called &ldquo;master                  race&rdquo; is based on the fact that the Germans were interacting                  with other human extraterrestrials, and a fair number of them                  are blond-haired and blue-eyed. So he thought that this was                  some sort of advanced race that he wanted to move people on                  Earth towards, or at least his chosen people. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, again, this is idiocy. What you look like, or what race                  you are, has <em>nothing</em> to do with how spiritual you                  are or how advanced you are, at all. In fact, on a DNA level,                  they&rsquo;ve now proven there&rsquo;s not even any genetic                  marker that allows you to easily distinguish one race from                  another. And based on the fact that DNA is an interface with                  your spiritual body, what really matters is the development                  of the soul, not the genetic heritage you come in with. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So this whole bloodline argument is Old World science that                  has no basis in fact.

In fact, the first documentation I ever heard                    about was in 1993, from a friend of mine, whose physics professor                    had worked for NASA through the &lsquo;70s.                  And they described 3 essential different types of ET they&rsquo;d                  found. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tallest of which essentially looked like us -- human being,                  normal human being more or less. Some slight variances in the                  color of the irises, the shape of the pupil, the shape of the                  teeth, that kind of stuff, but more or less the same. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The middle height was your typical Gray. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The shortest of which looked like a Gray, but the head was                  actually a helmet. And when you removed the helmet, there was                  something underneath that they would only refer to as <em>a                  monstrosity.</em> And although I never got confirmation that                  that monstrosity was a reptilian face, there are other witness                  testimonies that seem to assert that that&rsquo;s what it is. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, I do have reason to believe that you do have some humans                  who are evolved from a reptilian genetic base, and that they                  basically tend to be the more self-serving and negative types. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Rifts in Space/Time, Abductions</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact,                    you know, one of the things that Deacon&rsquo;s testimony                  said, which I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d mind me sharing,                  is that when we mess around with these wormholes, when we create                  these vortexes for traveling through space and time, you get                  something called a <em>rift</em>, and these nasty things can                  fly through the rift. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what he meant when he said nasty <em>things fly through                    the rift</em>, is these UFO beings that actually are doing                    the abductions, and then kind of try to set up shop once                    they&rsquo;re here, and make little bases and, try to, you                    know, stay here. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because                    otherwise, there is a quarantine around the Earth, so he                    says, and they can&rsquo;t get through. But when our                  guys create these portals, these stargates, if it&rsquo;s not                  done properly, then you can create a crack in the shield, and                  that&rsquo;s one of the problems that can happen.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But again, from the <em>Law of One</em> philosophy,                    perspective, which is my philosophical background, you&rsquo;re                    not going to be abducted unless you have actually invited                    it by being consistently unclear in your orientation as to                  whether you are service-to-self or service-to-others. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So most                    people have not been abducted. If you have been, it&rsquo;s                  probably not something you&rsquo;re going to remember anyway.                  And it&rsquo;s not really ...  it&rsquo;s not causing people                  excessive damage. I don&rsquo;t believe that people are being                  killed in these abductions. It&rsquo;s certainly not something                  that&rsquo;s pleasant, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to have one.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Are                    you saying that you believe that people who have been abducted                    are -- this is not to put words into your mouth; maybe you                    can correct me -- have in some way a spiritual or psychological                  weakness, which imperfection has given them that vulnerability?                  Is this actually what you&rsquo;re saying?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I believe                    there are two different types of abductions going on, one                    of which I would actually call &ldquo;contact&rdquo; more                  than abduction. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems                    that what&rsquo;s happening is that, part of the                  game is from the good guys, if you want to classify ET groups                  as good and bad. And the good guys are trying to keep a human                  stock of genetic material, on the offhand chance that they                  were not able to prevent a disaster, which is still very unlikely,                  but they don&rsquo;t want to take any chances. On the offhand                  chance that something went horribly wrong, they would have                  a genetic stock of human DNA sufficient to recreate a human                  gene-pool, and allow this grand experiment of human evolution                  to continue.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, those people appear to have volunteered for this before                  they were born. Every effort is made to not scare them. Every                  effort is made to give them a pleasurable experience, which                  also includes wonderful consciousness-raising things. And you                  can actually read the Betty Andreasson material for that. Now,                  some of those people may be afraid when they go through this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the                    other hand, you have a negative faction, which is probably                  these reptilian-genetic-stock humans. And that faction is wearing                  fake masks to look like the other group  ...  which is why,                  you know, the guy said that it looked like a Gray and you pull                  the mask off and underneath it was a monstrosity. And they&rsquo;re                  actually faking out the same procedure which is being done                  for positive purpose. Except that when they do it, they&rsquo;re                  terrifying people, and they&rsquo;re scaring people, and it&rsquo;s                  a lot more unpleasant. And those, actually, are much less frequent.                  So you have to clarify. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There&rsquo;s two different types of things going on. One                  is something that people volunteer for from before they&rsquo;re                  born, and it&rsquo;s essentially kept as positive a possible.                  The other is the negative trying to impersonate the positive,                  and thus making the whole thing look like all it&rsquo;s just                  a whole bunch of scary, terrifying stuff. That&rsquo;s what                  my research has concluded over the last 12 years of looking                  into this.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I would agree with you.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh,                    ok. Good, good. Yeah. So there&rsquo;s both types.                  So anyway, let&rsquo;s try to veer this back into current events,                  because that&rsquo;s what all this back-story is for.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again,                    the Rothschild side had limited interaction with the Anunnaki.                    It lasted for maybe about a decade and then it cut off. They                    got a limited amount of technology, which wasn&rsquo;t                  very effective. And that&rsquo;s all they were able to get.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then the Rockefeller side got the Roswell crash after World                  War II, shortly thereafter. They got access to a time-viewing                  technology called <em>Looking Glass</em>. In contacting these                  ETs, they were able to discover that this technology existed                  from the past, and that it could be found. And these ancient                  devices were actually the ones they predominantly started using.                  That&rsquo;s the one that Dan Burisch apparently has had the                  most experience with, is the ancient device.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2012</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, this                    dovetails into Burisch&rsquo;s testimony, insofar                  as  ...  his level of the pyramid, which he admits is probably                  compartmentalized and he also doesn&rsquo;t know everything,                  is that humanity has a big event that happens in 2012. From                  the perspective of these future humans, most of the people                  were no longer here. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A small group survived. And they broke off into two groups,                  one of which had underground bases, the other of which survived                  on the surface. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The people                    in the underground bases turned into what we would now think                    of as Grays, as a result of evolutionary changes that occurred,                    based on their environment and where they went. And the other                    group essentially turned into the Nordics, which look essentially                    human, but have the more conventional characteristics you&rsquo;d                    associate with Nordic sightings: blond hair, blue eyes, perfect                  bodies, you know, that kind of thing. Telepathic communication.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So Burisch&rsquo;s testimony, as you guys are well aware,                  is that they have these certain node points in time that they                  can travel through. They seem to be approximately 9,600 years                  apart, which I discovered is exactly &frac14; of the Earth&rsquo;s                  cycle of the Precession of Equinoxes, which is apparently the                  grand cycle that our dimensions move through as we travel from                  one dimension to another  ...  if you believe all that stuff. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyway,                    there&rsquo;s these various harmonic points that they                  can travel through, one of which is 45,000 years in the future,                  another of which is 52,000 years in the future. And I may be                  wrong on that 9,600 year figure. I have to look back  ... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I looked at that. I actually thought it was two-thirds                  of that, because I spent some time looking at this, and thought                  it was 6,400. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I think                    that&rsquo;s what it is. I think that&rsquo;s what                  it is.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: But                    anyway, the numbers aren&rsquo;t that important. The                  important part is there is a sub-harmonic of this master cycle                  that appears to be driven by the sun. And, at certain points                  in that cycle, there&rsquo;s an aperture that allows them to                  easily travel through time. And that&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re                  all doing it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So that&rsquo;s why we only have certain groups of our future                  coming back in time to help us. Or so they say, they&rsquo;re                  helping us. And from that perspective, some of the abductions                  are the harvesting of genetic material for the purposes of                  rejuvenating the future human stock, which had gotten really                  watered down by the low population that they started with. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, of                    course, underground bases and people surviving on the surface  ...  what you&rsquo;re                    probably dealing with here is these power groups that actually                  do have the underground bases and the technology. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, we                    also find out that the Rockefeller side learns about 2012                    and that there&rsquo;s some big event happening that will                  essentially change life on the surface of the Earth very dramatically.                  And as a result, they create a vast  ...  they start creating                  a vast network of underground bases. It&rsquo;s obvious the                  reason why they did this, to create a whole civilization, essentially,                  underground, is that they did not feel that the surface of                  the Earth would be viable to live on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now again, this gets into doom-and-gloom-sounding stuff. And                  I just want to make clear that my personal opinion is that                  the 2012 event refers to shifting in the energetic frequency,                  which will allow most of us on Earth to live in a parallel                  existence that is no longer on the physical plane. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It appears                    that some people don&rsquo;t go through that, and                  those are the people who survive. Now whether they&rsquo;re                  good guys or bad guys is not really important. The point is,                  some people might choose to stay here. Some people choose to                  go through this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don&rsquo;t                    believe everybody dies. I believe that there is a shifting                    of the ways, and that people go in different directions at                    this point. And a lot of the stuff I heard from Henry and                  from my other contact, Daniel, all seems to support this.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So anyway,                    getting back to what&rsquo;s going on right now,                  and the election, and how this relates to insider politics:                  You have this Rockefeller faction in which the splinter group                  of the Nazis comes over here  ...  Project Paperclip. They                  come into possession of wonderful technology. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they&rsquo;re all interconnected with the military-industrial                  complex, which very quickly breaks itself off from the government,                  and becomes its own separate entity in and of itself, guided                  over by this Rockefeller faction, which in essence, does not                  support Luciferian philosophy at all. If you talk to Burisch,                  which I have, they&rsquo;re very against the Illuminati, in                  fact, and believe that they&rsquo;re actually fighting the                  Illuminati and trying to stop the Illuminati from creating                  an antichrist figure that would be like a world leader.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So Burisch has said to me that they had a <em>Do not ask,                    do not tell</em> policy similar to gays in the military,                    where they would have meetings with the Illuminati at these                    groups called the Committee of the Majority. And as long                    as the Illuminati never talked about their Luciferian beliefs                    or their desire for an Antichrist, everything would be fine.                    But if they even brought it up at all, it&rsquo;s like, <em>to                    hell with you, the meeting&rsquo;s over, we&rsquo;re out                    of here</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s basically ...  it&rsquo;s sort of like                  this polite Mexican standoff that has existed, where one group,                  the Rockefeller side, has vastly superior technology and could                  actually, in fact, create a fake alien invasion, if they so                  desire. Now, that gets into whether in fact the ETs on the                  outside would allow them to do that, or whether it would actually                  be stopped. And I don&rsquo;t know the answer.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Torsion technology, weather wars</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And you                    also have to factor in that the Russians, completely independently                    of all this other stuff, had their own progression of technology,                    in secret, which began with the work of Alexander Gurwitsch                    in the early 20th century and was realized more fully by                    Nicolai Kozyrev -- the science of scalar waves, or what I                  call &ldquo;torsion fields.&rdquo; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And with these torsion technologies, they have a means in                  which, basically, all conventional war is obsolete. They can                  create massive hurricanes. They can create earthquakes.

And that&rsquo;s also what Colonel Thomas Bearden                  has said, that the Russian side is much more evolved and advanced                  than what the US side has. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s actually been realized, in this ongoing undisclosed                  war of weather, which has involved hurricanes attacking the                  US, in a quiet war that nobody knows is a war, which has been                  used at various politically opportune moments, including 2005,                  with  ...  I believe that was the one where Katrina happened                  that year, among the others which were <em>steered</em>, obviously.                  And Richard and I did a paper about that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know,                    you have these four different hurricanes that land over the                    exact same part of Florida. And the statistical impossibility                  of something like that is akin to  ... you&rsquo;re standing                  out of your second floor bedroom window, and you have a hula                  hoop on the ground, and you drop four feathers out of the window,                  in sequence, and they all land inside the hula hoop. The likelihood                  of that actually happening is so remote.

And the number 2                  is a perfect aerial font. I mean, it looks perfect. And it                  rotates with the eye of the hurricane. It was covered on the                  front page of Drudge Report. The actual footage of it is still                  on that website where it was originally featured  ...  some                  local news site in Florida.

And they apparently leased it or bought it, bought                    the technology from the Russians, and have been the ones  ...  according to Bearden; they&rsquo;re                  the ones that cooked up these hurricanes. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can see on the infrared footage how our guys are trying                  to draw lines of heat in the air to try to deflect the hurricane <em>[on                  the Sept 30, &rsquo;05 TBRNews archive - Ed]</em>. But it doesn&rsquo;t                  really work very well because the Russian-made technology is                  much more advanced. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And again,                    I believe that this was exactly what was being ...  I                  had a dream not too long ago. This gets back into the present                  moment, the politics around this election. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had a dream where I was on a the surface of a destroyer                  ship. And George Bush was there. And all of a sudden we look                  down into the ocean and we see that ship from the <em>Stargate:                  Atlantis</em> show, the <em>Pegasus</em>, which, in that show,                  it&rsquo;s like America&rsquo;s most advanced alien-derived                  technology. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, I see                    this ship under the ocean, and it launches a missile, and                    hits the battleship. And everybody&rsquo;s like, reeling                  on the battleship. And George Bush starts going nuts and saying, <em>Oh                  my god!

I didn&rsquo;t know what form it would take,                  but then it became very clear, through additional data, that                  it was this hurricane that was bearing down on New Orleans                  [Hurricane Gustav, 2008]. The purpose of that hurricane, in                  my opinion, was to throw off the Republican National Convention,                  which it did. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>McCain / Palin</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then,                    once everybody fled, and the Republican National Convention                    was thrown off into disarray as a result of McCain&rsquo;s                  astoundingly-bad decision to take on Palin  ...  and I have                  multiple sources that Palin was not supposed to be picked by                  Rove or by the Israeli side, which is the two basic sides at                  work now. The Israeli side wanted Lieberman. The Rove side                  wanted Romney. Nobody even knew who Palin was. Nobody was even                  considering it seriously. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But like  ...  in a similar way to what Adolph Hitler did                  in World War II -- and in no way am I trying to say that McCain                  is Hitler &ndash; but  ...  it&rsquo;s another example of                  somebody who believes that the power he&rsquo;s been given                  is his own, doesn&rsquo;t respect the fact that it&rsquo;s                  essentially a puppet Presidency. And he goes and makes a maverick                  decision -- which he calls himself a maverick -- and goes against                  his own party&rsquo;s wisdom and makes this pick, which  ...  </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Astonishingly                    enough, within days after the pick was made, they were already                    having to do a very embarrassing public disclosure of this                    woman&rsquo;s daughter being pregnant when she&rsquo;s,                  like, 17 years old. And she&rsquo;s supposedly the &ldquo;Family                  Values&rdquo; candidate! I don&rsquo;t think that was ever                  supposed to be brought out.

I believe Fulford&rsquo;s                  testimony is entirely accurate. The other world societies,                  secret societies and so forth, governments of the world, have                  kind of all allied. And this includes the Rothschild faction. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, you know, you kind of have like a Middle East-Arab faction,                  which is sort of its own entity. You have the Eastern Secret                  Society faction, which is like Japan, China, and many of the                  Southeast Asian countries. And then you also have the Rothschild                  faction. And they kind of have a truce and an alliance right                  now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And everybody&rsquo;s focused on knocking out the Rockefeller                  side, because the Rockefeller side is the big bully on the                  block. They have the most advanced technology, by far, and                  therefore it&rsquo;s dangerous.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I want                    to ask you about Putin. I think I know what your answer is                    going to be, but  ...  is he his own man?

I have to align with                  what Fulford is saying on this subject. Because it appears                  that Putin really did overthrow the Illuminati and got them                  out of his country. And that&rsquo;s part of why he&rsquo;s                  been so scorned in the media. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you                    guys  ...  have you guys read any of the Edgar Cayce                  stuff?

I really                  do. Because what&rsquo;s happened is  ...  Georgia, again,                  was supposed to bomb South Ossetia. And this was all being                  orchestrated by Israeli and US factions, CIA and so forth. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, again,                    here&rsquo;s another interesting side-note on                  that, bringing in the Israel component. Israel, of course,                  was a state that was created in an effort to provide reparations                  to the Jews for what happened in World War II. Now, you&rsquo;ve                  read testimony from Svali. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen                  this, where she says the Illuminati absolutely despise Israel                  and want to see nothing more than it to be completely wiped                  out. That&lsquo;s the Rothschild side. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what                    happens, again, is, the Rockefeller side and the Israelis                  actually banded up and they&rsquo;ve joined forces, and they&rsquo;re                  using the same tradecraft that Hitler had, that the Rothschilds                  developed, to try to do it over here in the US. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, it&rsquo;s like both sides using the same type of technology,                  including creating a fake invasion of your own country  ...  a                  fake attack, the 9/11  ...  which, in Hitler&rsquo;s case,                  was the bombing of his parliament building, which he blamed                  on Poland, and then proceeded to invade Poland. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We blamed                    it on the Arabs, predominantly Iraqis and the Afghanis, even                    though most of the hijackers were Saudis. And they don&rsquo;t                  even seem to have anything to do with it, except that they                  were puppets. And we know a lot about that, which we don&rsquo;t                  need to go into.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But anyway,                    the point being, that the Israelis are now very involved                    in the Rockefeller faction. And Fulford&rsquo;s testimony                  is that David Rockefeller himself is no longer in control of                  this, either. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It really                    does seem to be, from some of the testimony that Dr. Stephen                    Greer has come out with, that, believe it or not, the guy                    who is at the top of everything is George Bush, Sr. And Cheney.                    And these guys are ...  That&rsquo;s the tippy-top                  of this Rockefeller side now, more than the Rockefellers anymore.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Brzezinski and Obama</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.

I agree. Now, the Brzezinski thing is a very interesting                    and controversial angle. And I&rsquo;ve had                  extensive conversation on the phone with Richard Hoagland about                  this. Because, as I&rsquo;ve said before and I&rsquo;ll say                  again, I&rsquo;ve had extensive dream data telling me that                  Obama is one of the good guys. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then                    you&rsquo;d say to yourself, <em>OK if he&rsquo;s                    a good guy, then why in the world would he bring in Brzezinski?</em> And                    Richard and I have talked about this. And Richard&rsquo;s                    opinion, which I agree with, is: You keep your friends close,                    and you keep your enemies closer. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What better                    way to know what they&rsquo;re planning and what                  they want to do, than to have the guy there in your cabinet?                  You hear his side of things, and you hear what he wants to                  do, because you&rsquo;re smart enough not to be manipulated                  by him. Now, granted, he&rsquo;s taken a lot of heat for it.                  And lot of people think that he buys into Brzezinski&rsquo;s                  beliefs, but I don&rsquo;t believe that at all. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And again,                    I think when he picked Joe Biden as his VP, it&rsquo;s                  a political decision that was made because he&rsquo;s trying                  to win an American election. And it&rsquo;s a dirty game, it&rsquo;s                  not easy, and it&rsquo;s ugly. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I honestly                    don&rsquo;t think that, just because he&rsquo;s                  got his enemy in the camp, that means that he&rsquo;s agreeing                  with everything his enemy says at all. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think ...  Richard and I are unanimous in this, in agreeing                  that the extent of change that Obama actually wants to create                  is much more than he&rsquo;s actually been saying so far. And,                  from what I can tell, the insiders are terrified about Obama                  ever becoming president. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Rockefellers vs. Rothschilds, political parties</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And you&rsquo;re seeing a massive media effort to try to frame                  this election as if it&rsquo;s an even run between McCain and                  Obama, which is ludicrous. It&rsquo;s ludicrous. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we                    know for a fact, from the TBRNews source, that these polls                    are faked, that they&rsquo;ve been faked for a long,                  long time. You call up 700 people in the reddest Republican                  state, who you know are the most likely to be brainwashed fundamentalists.                  And, even in those cases, only, like, 50% of &lsquo;em are                  saying they&rsquo;re going to vote for McCain. And that&rsquo;s                  where you&rsquo;re getting your 50/50 dead-heat from.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, let                    me point out something else which I find highly fascinating.                  Burisch has said, and you guys both know this, so I&rsquo;m                  preaching to the choir here, that because of the onrushing                  2012 event  ...  which, incidentally, the Rockefellers kept                  secret from the Rothschilds until relatively recently. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rothschilds had their own plan to dominate the world,                  and take over, and create their <em>Illuminated New World Order</em> circa                  2020, somewhere in that region. And it&rsquo;s now been thwarted,                  because there&rsquo;s not going to be a 2020 with any world                  the way that we know it. And the Rockefeller side knew this                  and they deliberately withheld that information from the Rothschilds                  up until fairly recently.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what&rsquo;s happened is, the Rothschild side has run out                  of time to bring their agenda forward. They were promoting                  Hillary Clinton as the Presidential candidate. Because, in                  essence, what&rsquo;s been happening in American politics for                  the last 50 years, is that you get the Rothschilds running                  the Democrat side and you get the Rockefellers running the                  Republican side. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there                    has been a shooting war between these two sides, including                    who gets to control the CIA, who gets to control the FBI,                    the NSA, the NRO, all these different groups. And it&rsquo;s                    been a constant contentious battle of the intelligence agencies                  in terms of who gets to run what.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, of                    course, the Rothschilds side wanted to try to collapse the                    Rockefellers&rsquo; oil empire by promoting things like,                  you know, the Green movement, the global warming movement,                  Al Gore&rsquo;s <em>Inconvenient Truth</em>. Gore was, of course ...  I                  think he&rsquo;s a maverick too. I think he might have been                  in it in the beginning and now he&rsquo;s broken away from                  it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it&rsquo;s very fascinating. There is actually a Fox News                  video clip that I will have in this article I&rsquo;m writing                  tonight on my website, <a href="https://www.divinecosmos.com">www.divinecosmos.com</a> ,                  in which Lady de Rothschild is interviewed by Fox News. And                  she is slagging the heck out of Obama. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And she tried to create this website, did create this website,                  which I believe is called together4us, [ <a href="https://together4us.com/">https://together4us.com/</a> ]                  which is basically trying to get those 18 million people who                  wanted to vote for Hillary to rebel and try to throw the election                  back in her favor. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    is  ...  the name Rothschild is right there on                  the screen. This woman talks for four or five minutes straight                  about this. She&rsquo;s very charged about it, definitely does                  not want to see Obama to be President. She disses him hard.                  And she&rsquo;s basically trying to promote the candidacy of                  Hillary.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Amnesty</strong></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, again,                    I don&rsquo;t have any problem with somebody being                  affiliated with a particular family lineage or a particular                  occult group. I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t recommend that anybody                  do that. But at the same time, I believe that hating these                  people is not the answer. I think it&rsquo;s important that                  we acknowledge that they&rsquo;re out there, and that we prevent                  them from doing things to harm humanity. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we                    also can&rsquo;t genocide them, because that&lsquo;s                  the same playbook that&rsquo;s been causing so many problems                  on the Earth. And yet, unfortunately, they know on the inside,                  that if the masses were to find out what&rsquo;s going on,                  in large numbers, that the lynch-mob would be out immediately.                  And that&rsquo;s not really a viable solution. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That&rsquo;s one of the things that Fulford is talking about.                  Fulford is describing how, even though it&rsquo;s basically                  checkmate for the Rockefellers, as of September 30th , they&rsquo;re                  being called to come up with this debt that they owe from when                  the Reagan administration overthrew the Soviet Union and pillaged                  all their money by bombarding them with fake Russian ruble                  currency. It was a very successful operation, which allowed                  the massive siphoning out of the Russian wealth to the Rockefeller                  faction, to the tune of, you know, trillions and trillions                  of dollars. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And now                    that money is being demanded to be paid back; they don&rsquo;t                    have it. And so what Fulford is saying is these Eastern Secret                    Societies are essentially holding the Rockefeller side at                    gunpoint saying, <em>Look, if you guys don&rsquo;t                  do this, we&rsquo;re going to hurt you and we have the ability                  to do that,</em> and it basically amounts to, you know, them                  getting a loan because nobody wants to see the American economy                  collapse, because it&rsquo;s all international now. There&rsquo;s                  no real national economy anymore. These countries are all multinational,                  so the wealth will be redistributed so that there&rsquo;s no                  collapse. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the main key now is how do you effectively neuter and                  silence the influence of this proto-Nazi faction that has taken                  up root in predominately the secret government of the U.S.                  And this ties back in with the crop circles and with August                  16th and why the crop circles flagged that particular date                  as being important. Again, you see one of the crop circles                  showing up next to these 4 windmills, suggesting something                  on August 16th has to do with the overthrow of the oil economy. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then again                    you see the fact that on August 7th, the day that the war                    started, I published this picture on Richard&rsquo;s                  website of Wernher von Braun, a Nazi scientist, who came to                  the U.S. and started this whole problem. And I had an infinity                  symbol in that picture which then shows up as a crop formation                  the very next day on 8/ 8/ 8. And that crop formation counted                  out the days to August 16th. It&rsquo;s the number 8, there                  was 8 days to the 16th, and also showed the phases of the moon                  in the diagram according to <a href="https://www.Cropcircleconnector.com">www.Cropcircleconnector.com</a> ,                  and the researchers on that site. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK, fast                    forward to September 1st, I&rsquo;m going to bed                  at night. This is an unbelievably fascinating side note to                  the story and it&rsquo;ll kind of tie off my big point here.                  September 1st I&rsquo;m getting ready to go to bed and I hear                  a very distinct message come in. And the message says, Open                  up the Law of One series, book III, to page 100 and read it.                  And this is very unusual. This is not something that normally                  happens to me. So I go get book III, I pop it open to page                  100 and it didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything important. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s was talking about this cycle in which they say                  that you count 18 days at a time from when you&rsquo;re born                  and, that during the first 9 days of the cycle, your spiritual                  and psychic abilities will be higher. And during the second                  9 days of the cycle, your spiritual abilities will wane. And                  they say everybody is affected by this cycle. That you start                  counting from the day you&rsquo;re born, you count right up                  to the present, to figure out where you are. They say your                  single best 3 days are days 4, 5 and 6 in the cycle and, that                  at the turning points of the cycle, you have the most trouble. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They also                    say that the more spiritually balanced you become, the more                    this cycle doesn&rsquo;t affect you anymore. Now,                  I&rsquo;ve read about this all the way back in January 1996.                  I never felt compelled to try to crunch the numbers to figure                  out where I was in the cycle because it didn&rsquo;t seem that                  big of a deal to me at the time. I just never even thought                  about it and, all of a sudden on September 1st, I&rsquo;m told <em>read                  book III, page 100</em> and this is what it says.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I went                    to sleep, I didn&rsquo;t think anymore of it. Two                  days later I&rsquo;m going to bed, again, the message comes                  in again, <em>Open up book III and read page 100</em>. OK,                  fine. So I open up book III. Not surprisingly it&rsquo;s exactly                  the same information: 18 day cycle. I say, <em>OK, this is                  getting too weird.</em> I go over to the computer. I get on                  Google and I type calculate days since birth. And I looked                  for some kind of software that would allow me to do that. Sure                  enough I find this little thing. It&rsquo;s a Java Script that                  you can install on your webpage, tells you exactly how many                  days it&rsquo;s been since you were born. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I punch up the number and, to make a long story short, the                  day that I was first asked this question, <em>Go to book III,                  read page 100</em>, it had been exactly 12,960 days since I                  was born. Divide that number by 18 and you get exactly 720                  cycles, precisely, of these 18 days since when I was born.                  720, of course, is 2 times 360. 360 is the number of degrees                  in a circle and the crop formation that came from my thoughts                  and from the article I did from Richard, three weeks earlier,                  was in fact 2 circles. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So this                    just, this was mind-blowing. And then I&rsquo;m saying                  how in the world did my &ndash; because, consciously, I had                  no idea -- how could I have known that such a perfect round                  number as 720, that it was that number of 18 cycles since I                  was born, on that exact day. And yet, on that exact day, I&rsquo;m                  told to go read that exact page in the book where it describes                  that cycle. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So then                    I&rsquo;m thinking ok, what the heck does this mean?                  And it was on that exact day that McCain&rsquo;s campaign had                  to admit that Palin&rsquo;s daughter was pregnant. And so I                  believe that, with all these different levels of synchronicity                  tied together, that what I&rsquo;m being shown is that these                  are history-making events. And you go back into the inside                  testimony of what happened on August 16th, it may turn, we                  know that&rsquo;s the day that Russia won the war. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That by                    that time all the CIA had completely fled. They left behind                    all their toys, all their documents, all their secret junk.                    Russia now has possession of that and BELIEVE me, they intend                    on publishing everything. They are going to make it public.                    It&rsquo;s not going to be kept secret. It&rsquo;s                  going to blow the whistle on the whole thing. And I already                  thought this was amazing enough, but then when you see 6, at                  least, different crop formations that tie this in, not only                  with the date of August 16th, but directly with 2012, the end                  of the Mayan Calendar, it appears that what we&rsquo;re being                  told is that the events that are happening right now are directly                  paving the way for the downfall of the Rockefeller/Nazi faction                  that has been illicitly running this country and running the                  show for 50 some years. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That this treasure trove of documents Russia has come into                  possession with will be what is necessary to bring them down.                  Obviously the most dangerous period of time that remains is                  between now and the election because this war in Russia, in                  Georgia rather, was their big attempt to try to create total                  chaos, to bomb Iran and to create Martial Law. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, I                    agree with you guys and with what your sources are saying.                    There will probably be other attempts. There undoubtedly                    will be other attempts to create some sort of chaos between                  now and the election. To try to sway it in McCain&rsquo;s favor;                  however, given the astonishing synchronicities that I&rsquo;ve                  seen, the crop formation with the number 8, right?; describing                  the drawing that I&rsquo;d just made the night before and published                  for the world to see on <a href="https://www.enterprisemission.com">www.enterprisemission.com</a> ;                  the fact that this 720 cycle of 18 days happened on the exact                  day that McCain&rsquo;s campaign said that Sarah Palin&rsquo;s                  daughter was pregnant; the fact that , that other crop formation                  that pointed to August 16th was drawn directly next to a bunch                  of windmills that generate wind electricity -- all of these                  signs seem to be showing that we&rsquo;re heading towards a                  positive future. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plus, I&rsquo;ve had several dreams which seem to indicate                  that, though these things will be attempted, that they&rsquo;re                  not actually going to pan out. They will attempt to crash the                  economy. It will be successful to some degree. We&rsquo;re                  probably going to see a pretty horrifying market vomit happen                  very soon. We&rsquo;re probably going to see more attempts                  made to create some kind of war. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s                  going to be successful. So, now you&rsquo;ve heard my very                  longwinded diatribe on all these events.

One of which                  is the technology that you say the Rothschild side DOESN&rsquo;T                  have. I have to say personally I&rsquo;m pretty suspicious                  of that. I do have my own sighting in Switzerland to use as                  documentation, if you will, of a craft that was extremely sophisticated                  and was built by us, so to speak, meaning humans. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: It could have come from anywhere on the planet, probably                  in about half an hour.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Exactly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yeah, exactly.

And there we wonder                  just how sophisticated their side is. There&rsquo;s indications                  that the Russians are either equal to or ahead of us, but I                  often wonder whether, if you&rsquo;ve read The Art Of War,                  you know, that one of the things you do in war is always pretend                  to be less than you are. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So that the opposite side will be deceived.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And                    I think it&rsquo;s much more likely that that&rsquo;s                  what actually is going on here. That the U.S. is pretending                  and, this is the hole I also see in Richard Hoagland&rsquo;s                  research thus far on the von Braun thing, is that U.S. is PRETENDING                  to be less sophisticated than the Russians but, in fact, that&rsquo;s                  not the case. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well,                    I think in terms of ground troops and conventional military                    force, they [the US] are at a disadvantage. There&rsquo;s                  been a lot credible testimony that the military has been pretty                  much flattened out, that the helicopters and the tanks are                  all filled with sand and most of them can&rsquo;t even run.                  And all they&rsquo;re doing now is really just maintaining                  very small territories within Iraq. They can&rsquo;t even really                  occupy very much of it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But                    it&rsquo;s not a ground war anymore.

Earthquakes are being thrown around. You                  had somebody that basically liquefied the metal on that bridge                  in wherever it was, Michigan. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That was clearly a torsion field attack.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Absolutely.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That                    was definitely not natural.

What it DID,                  is it further convinced the American people that the Bush Administration                  was responsible for the infrastructure collapsing. It was a                  very blatant demonstration that we were not spending enough                  money on our own infrastructure. In my opinion ... that was                  probably what it was intended to do. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK, what about the notion that Mike McConnell headed a                  coup that has already happened? If you will, sometime back                  earlier this year, actually. And that his faction is very much                  at war with the Bush side, the Nazis, and Dan Burisch is part                  of the, is behind the Mike McConnell side. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That&rsquo;s pretty fascinating.

We want to see people start to get along. We                  want to see the economy be good. We want to see less war, less                  terrorism and we can&rsquo;t continue to fight amongst each                  other. How are we supposed to become a member of this galactic                  society if we can&rsquo;t even clean our own house up? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know                    there&rsquo;s all these other people out there and                  they&rsquo;re not very enlightened about  ...  they don&rsquo;t  ...  they                  are enlightened, but they&rsquo;re not very keen on the idea                  of us joining them right now, because all we want to do is                  blow people up and think everybody&rsquo;s a terrorist. So                  we need this kind of separation and conflict mentality to fall                  apart, and I think the manifestation of Sarah Palin was a BAD                  mistake on McCain&rsquo;s part. Because what it&rsquo;s done                  is, it&rsquo;s basically him telling the whole country, <em>If                  you&rsquo;re not a fundamentalist Christian, F you, we don&rsquo;t                  need your vote.

I mean it&rsquo;s ridiculous. Nobody                  wants to go with that stuff. You know and what we&rsquo;re                  seeing, there was a brilliant article by Deepak Chopra on Huffington                  Post where he was basically describing the battle between the                  lower self and the higher self that&rsquo;s playing itself                  out in politics where Palin&rsquo;s perspective, the fundamentalist                  perspective, is all about my country, right or wrong. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That was                    the old Viet Nam motto.

That&rsquo;s                  what they all started saying right after 911. They didn&rsquo;t                  say God bless humanity or God bless the world; they said God                  bless our country. To try to rally everyone around the flag                  and nationalism rather than, <em>Hey, if we can figure out                  why these people are so upset, then maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t                  want to blow us up anymore.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in                    fact, I have an article here from Newsweek. This is June                    2nd, 2008, and it&rsquo;s written by a Muslim; his name                  is Fareed Zakaria, and the title of the article is: <em>The                  Only Thing We Have to Fear.</em> And what he actually demonstrates                  here is that the actual amount of terrorism that&rsquo;s happening                  in the world has substantially decreased. However, our controlled                  media is cooking the books by using the war deaths in Iraq,                  calling all those deaths terrorism deaths. When in fact, it                  says here the number of Islamist attacks has actually declined                  65% from its high point in 2004. Fatalities from such attacks                  have declined by 90%. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    Iraq deaths account for 80% of all the terrorism deaths that                    are being counted. So what&rsquo;s happening is, in fact,                  fewer and fewer people are committing these atrocities. Fewer                  and fewer deaths are happening from terrorism. The world is                  actually getting safer and the only place where it&rsquo;s                  still really messed up is in Iraq, where we&rsquo;re trying                  to occupy this country. So, the whole idea that we&rsquo;re                  in this dangerous world and that there&rsquo;s all these rabid                  fundamentalists out there, that are trying to kill us, is becoming                  less and less true. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even the                    people who would be inclined to want to join these rabid                    fundamentalist groups are not doing it. They&rsquo;re                  veering away from it, because everybody wants to see the planet                  move to peace. Nobody wants to see this crap happen anymore.                  And these guys who would have been terrorists are now seeing, <em>hey,                  if I were to successfully attack America all it&rsquo;s going                  to do is give them an excuse to seize more power, declare Martial                  Law, try to throw people into camps </em>-- and all this ridiculous                  Nazi-fantasy stuff that I highly doubt will ever happen.

And by knocking out these 50 guys, you basically solve                  the problem. And I think what they&rsquo;re trying to do now                  is to capture them, rather than kill them. But the point being                  that they need to stand trial or, at least, maybe they won&rsquo;t                  even have to have that to happen. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of                    Fulford&rsquo;s deals was just stop what you&rsquo;re                  doing, let go of the control, we&rsquo;ll let you go back to                  your palaces and your mansions, but you just can&rsquo;t mess                  with the world anymore. And you know that kind of amnesty might                  be what&rsquo;s required to get this thing to work.

Regardless of how the election turns out, things                  are going to be very different after that, because they&rsquo;re                  not going to be allowed to do this anymore. And again, the                  reason why, in my opinion, the crop circles are flagging August                  16th is that&rsquo;s when Russia basically got all these documents                  that they WILL use -- if McCain steals the election in particular                  -- to basically bring the whole thing down. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plus, there                    was one thing I forgot to say. Let me just say this, it&rsquo;s a little side note. Now that they don&rsquo;t                  have the Looking Glass, they can&rsquo;t see the future anymore.                  They can&rsquo;t predict what&rsquo;s going happen. That&rsquo;s                  why they lost to Russia and Georgia, because they did not have                  the technology anymore to see the future. They didn&rsquo;t                  know that Russia was going to blitzkrieg them like that. They                  didn&rsquo;t see that McCain was going pull an end-run on them                  and declare somebody his nominee that they&rsquo;d never vetted.                  Both of these things are SUBSTANTIAL attacks that would have                  been prevented if they still had the Looking Glass operational,                  but they don&rsquo;t. And again, I find it very intriguing                  what you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s even a coup within                  the American house itself, where McConnell is now leading the                  factions trying to stop this stuff also. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK, David I have to say that there IS a problem with the                  overall thing here in regard to the Rothschilds being, as Benjamin                  would say, in a sense, the good guys in this scenario.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh, I did NOT say that at all and, if you heard that, you                  misheard me.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK, well in the sense that they are not the rabid Nazis                  that the faction that came over to the U.S.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: No,                    I disagree, so we&rsquo;re probably on the same page,                  but go ahead.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Right,                    right. Well let me say what I have to say here. We have this                    insider named &ldquo;Hawkeye&rdquo; and you may                  have read his material. What he talks about, he calls them                  the Roths  ... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: OK,                right  ... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:  ...  all the time and, basically, he is the Roths&rsquo; boy                  in the sense that he is coming to us as a whistleblower but,                  at the same time, he is doing their bidding and he is saying,                  he has said &ndash; and, you know, you can read it on our blog                  where we put most of his posts -- he is, in essence, saying                  that it&rsquo;s the Rothschilds&rsquo; agenda to bring down                  the United States government. To bring down the United States                  and put it under the Rothschilds once and for all.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Absolutely,                that&rsquo;s the whole plan.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And that the concentration camps and the very dark side                  of what may come down is BECAUSE of the Rothschilds and that                  IS their agenda as well. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I would                    probably agree insofar as the Rockefeller faction is less                    likely to actually want to throw people in camps. They do                    want the power, but, in general, they try to paint themselves                  as the more pleasing of the two societies, less inclined to                  try to go in this evil direction. They basically try to justify                  what they&rsquo;re doing as that they&rsquo;re fighting this                  menace, which is on the Rothschild side. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, in                    order to more fully explore what you&rsquo;ve now                  brought up, we have to get into the fact that, essentially,                  both sides of this equation, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds,                  have gone bankrupt. And when you go back to the Svali materials,                  she, in my opinion, is the most thoroughly documented Illuminati                  whistleblower ever to come forward. She has two complete books                  worth of material that she published. She also has a whole                  series of articles that she published and they are very specific                  and very detailed. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, she                    actually outlines how the Rothschild side makes its money.                  And it goes into pharmaceuticals; it goes into illegal gun                  trade; it goes into human trafficking; it goes into the drug                  trade; it goes into big media, like Hollywood; big music, like                  the music industry, particularly, apparently, country music                  is one of the most heavily-compromised industries within this                  business. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There&rsquo;re several key elements. So essentially, the Rothschild                  side is heavily invested in the media and in the pharmaceuticals                  and in the illicit weapons trade. Well you just heard me read                  you a statistic that shows that the demand for these illicit                  weapons is plummeted by 74%. Much fewer of these attacks are                  happening, so that trade is falling apart. The drug trade is                  actually falling apart. More and more people are cleaning up.                  Business is not what it used to be. The pharmaceutical industry                  is in terrible trouble. So, Hollywood is collapsing. This past                  weekend was the worst sales they&rsquo;ve had since, I believe,                  2004 for that particular weekend. The music industry has completely                  collapsed because of illegal downloading. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The controlled                    press with the newspapers is collapsed, because of things                    like Craig&rsquo;s List. The television is collapsed,                  essentially, because of streaming video like <em>YouTube</em> and                  what we&rsquo;ve done together. So what you&rsquo;re seeing                  again, fundamentally, is the whole economy is shifting away                  from centralized power making huge profits and towards decentralized                  power, in which true economic growth can occur, because it&rsquo;s                  much more evenly balanced. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    that&rsquo;s why, again, in my opinion, and from what                  I&rsquo;ve been shown from my own guidance, for what it&rsquo;s                  worth, there&rsquo;s a 2-step process that&rsquo;s happening                  here. Step 1 is the collapse of the Rockefeller side. Step                  2 is the collapse of the Rothschild side. The step one needs                  to happen first, because these guys have the most potential                  to do the greatest damage right now. Step 2, I don&rsquo;t                  think is far behind. And I do believe that, like with Fulford&rsquo;s                  faction, and just with the dawning public awareness, their                  plans will not work. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because                    if you actually get into what the Rothschild side wants:                    first of all, they are devotedly Luciferian, which is essentially                    Satanic. They want a New World Order where they are seen                    as gods and liberators. They want us to ACCEPT them that                    way. They want to create a global economic collapse, which                  is their script that, by creating this collapse first, that                  they will then be seen as our rescuers. And in so rescuing                  us they will basically come out of the closet, say here&rsquo;s                  who we are, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are                    your leaders, these 13 families which are at the head of                    the thing. And we want to be, you know, we want to be your                    benevolent gods on the planet. And it&rsquo;s like                  they&rsquo;re so wrapped up in their own cult that they don&rsquo;t                  realize - everyone who&rsquo;s not a part of it - it&rsquo;s                  a complete fantasy. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nobody&rsquo;s going to want to go along with it. Even though                  they&rsquo;ve created so many movies that promote their agenda                  -- and one of the all time best movies, which is not a very                  good movie, entertainment-wise, but one of the most blatant                  movies they ever made, was <em>Daredevil</em>, with Ben Affleck.                  That movie is an Illuminati handbook from the 1st frame to                  the last frame, every single shot.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> is another paramount example.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh,                    absolutely. That was where Kubrick was trying to blow the                    whistle and come out with all sorts of information to sort                  of show what was going on. But again, it&rsquo;s probably the                  case of, you know, one group against another kind of thing.                  So no, in no way would I ever want to be seen to be overtly                  supporting the Rothschild faction as in any way benevolent                  or the good guys. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All I&rsquo;m saying is that it appears that what&rsquo;s                  happening right now is that, for a short time, they will appear                  to win. They will appear to pull into the lead and bring down                  the Rockefeller faction. But they also are very weak. They                  also have lost strength of their own membership; their own                  members want to get out badly. Most of the people in this group                  are not there by choice, but they&rsquo;re there because they                  were born into it. And if they tried to escape, they would                  be killed. And they don&rsquo;t like it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I think                    your friend, Hawkeye, is just one of many examples. In this                    case somebody who&rsquo;s very high ranking, apparently,                  from what you&rsquo;re telling me, who still is, like, betraying                  his own so-called family, because he doesn&rsquo;t want to                  be involved in this thing either. It may appear that I&rsquo;m                  coming at this from a sort of Pollyanna, glass-half-full perspective.                  And I can hear people that want to say that to me. And that&rsquo;s                  ok. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All I&rsquo;m saying is that part of what informs my opinion                  is a very reliable and consistent intuitive track record in                  which I have been given extensive information on the Rothschild                  faction. In fact, I&rsquo;ve studied them intuitively a lot                  more than the Rockefeller side. The Rockefeller side is...                  a lot of that I&rsquo;ve learned from actually talking to people                  who are in it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas                    the Rothschild side, I got to talk Svali a little bit, but                    most of it has come from dedicated research and also intuitive                    viewing, which then has been borne out in terms of the changes                    in the economy that we&rsquo;re seeing. So I do                  feel that the planet is moving in a positive direction. I do                  feel that these groups are being exposed. And that part of                  what&rsquo;s happening at this time in humanity is a mass awakening                  in which people are learning about this stuff. And from knowledge                  comes a healing -- because you can only sustain a conspiracy                  for so long. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Cosa                    Nostra [ La Cosa Nostra ] was, you know, the Italian mafia,                    used to be a secret society. It all fell apart and now everybody                    make movies about it. And I think what you&rsquo;re                  going to see with all these secret factions are the same thing.                  The internet has basically brought them down already. I mean                  everybody knows what&rsquo;s going on. It&rsquo;s amazing that                  these guys, as Fulford has said, haven&rsquo;t already been                  dragged into the streets. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    any of these groups that are basically anti life. That are                    trying to genocide the planet to reduce population, for whatever                    reason they feel they need to. All that stuff is unraveling.                  And again, some people might want to call me na&iuml;ve but                  when you have something happen like, <em>hey go read page a                  hundred in book III,</em> and you find out that, on that exact                  day, it&rsquo;s been 720 cycles of 18 days since you were born.                  It&rsquo;s one of those consistent exclamation points that                  I keep getting to show me that I&rsquo;m on the right track,                  that my information is reliable. So, there you have it. [Laughs]</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK, David, thank you so much. Bill, did you have any other                  questions?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I&rsquo;ve got a bunch and I&rsquo;m sure, Kerry, you have,                  too; but this is actually a 2 hour conversation -- my feeling                  is it&rsquo;s not actually appropriate to take it in a whole                  host of different directions, because we easily all could and                  we could have a barrel of fun doing it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Yeah. Absolutely</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: But                    this feels like a very concise presentation which will help                    people&rsquo;s understanding -- like as an understanding                  aid to help interpret a lot of the events which have been happening                  and which may happen in the immediate future -- which is what                  a lot of our listeners will appreciate this for. And it seems                  like this recording has worked pretty well. It would be fun                  to do it another time David, if your ever interested in having                  another conversation. We&rsquo;ve got a lot of questions stored                  up and you&rsquo;ve probably got a lot more stored up to say.                  What do you think?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: It&rsquo;s sort of regrettable in one sense that there                  IS SO much exposition required to just establish the basic                  discussion as I&rsquo;ve now done, in terms of all this different                  research that&rsquo;s come together from so many different                  sources. And I agree that you must have hundreds and hundreds                  of questions coming out of all this. What I can say is, as                  you guys already know, unfortunately, our paths are not crossing                  favorably, because I&rsquo;m leaving on Thursday for 2 weeks.                  I&rsquo;ll be back on the 25th of September. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;m working in the studio on a vocal music album called                  Wanderer Awakening, but after that time, I would be more than                  happy to continue this discussion. And, by then, you probably                  will have a whole litany of questions from your discussion                  forum of people wanting to know more about this or that or                  the other. And I also have said to you guys that I&rsquo;d                  like to be put in touch with Benjamin Fulford, if possible,                  because I think some of the things he&rsquo;s talked about                  in terms of how the world is changing in a positive direction                  dovetail nicely with what I know and I think he&rsquo;d be                  interested to hear what I have to say on that stuff. So I hope                  that will happen. I also, of course, speak a little Japanese                  and used to have a Japanese girlfriend, so there&rsquo;re some                  interesting crossovers there. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: We&rsquo;ll definitely put you in touch with Benjamin,                  that&rsquo;s not a problem at all. The only thing I want to                  say here, David, is that, unlike what Bill is saying in terms                  of questions, I think what we would have are alternate points                  of view, things to add and to get into things a little deeper,                  you know, from differing points of view. I think that&rsquo;s                  what we would bring to the table. I appreciate that you&rsquo;re                  happy to do that as well. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there&rsquo;re so many others like us doing the same thing                  right now and that&rsquo;s part of the wonderful puzzle that                  we&rsquo;ve got going on here, that there are people coming                  forward, truth tellers -- people putting themselves on the                  line to tell the truth and this is what makes your research                  possible and actually Project Camelot possible. And so we&rsquo;ll                  do this again soon.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yeah,                    and I just again want to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for                  creating a platform in which people who have something to share                  like myself can come forward and be able to give their perspective                  and be heard. Of course I do that on my own website and I also                  have consistently been gratified by the efforts that you guys                  have made to seek out these witnesses and interview them. I                  think you&rsquo;ve done a great job and I&rsquo;m glad to continue                  to share my perspective with you so sometime after September                  25th, when I get back from my studio work on the album we&rsquo;ll                  continue the conversation. I look forward to it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Great. Take care, David.
