<br><br>

BILL RYAN
(BR):  This is Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot and
the date is... we can never get the date right! What&rsquo;s the
date?
<br><br>

Kerry
Cassidy (KC):  The 26th.
<br><br>

BR:   The
26th of July, 2009. We&rsquo;re at the Exopolitics Summit in
Barcelona, Spain, and it&rsquo;s our huge privilege personally, I
must say... I want to ask Kerry in a moment to add to my introduction
here. I&rsquo;m going to introduce you, Alfred Webre, who&rsquo;s
never appeared on camera with us before. Alfred, it&rsquo;s a
privilege to be talking to you.
<br><br>

ALFRED
WEBRE (AW):  Thank you.

<br><br>

BR:  I&rsquo;ve
been an admirer of yours for many years. Bob Dean, who has become a
very close personal friend over the last couple of years, and he
blames us entirely for his new-found popularity among all the young
ladies in the world who are following Exopolitics. [Kerry laughs]
<br><br>

BOB DEAN
(BD):  Shame on you.
<br><br>

BR:  It&rsquo;s
either you or Sean Connery.<B> </B>He&rsquo;s
just not available anymore.




KC:  All
right, absolutely.
<br><br>

BR:  And
all this kidding notwithstanding, we want to introduce somebody who
we have presented to the world over the last three years, somebody
who we also know and love dearly and who&rsquo;s become a personal
friend for even longer than Bob has.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;ve
called him &ldquo;Henry Deacon&rdquo;, which seemed like a good idea
at the time. I can&rsquo;t even start to call him his real name,
because I can&rsquo;t even remember it, because, for me, he&rsquo;s
forever <I>Henry</I>. And Henry, it is entirely up to you whether you
want to reveal your name again.
<br><br>

&lsquo;HENRY
DEACON&rsquo; / ARTHUR NEUMANN (HD/AN):  I&rsquo;ll just say my
name&rsquo;s Arthur [Arthur Neumann].

<br><br>

BR:  His
name&rsquo;s Arthur. Okay. Do you want to be&mdash;and this is a
serious question&mdash;do you want to be known as Arthur or Art?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah, just Arthur, thank you. I&rsquo;m tired of the Henry thing.

<br><br>

BR:
You&rsquo;re tired of the Henry thing. Henry is dead. Long live
Arthur.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
And Camelot.
<br><br>

BR:  And
Camelot, exactly. It&rsquo;s got something to do with King Arthur.

<br><br>

KC:  See,
he stole your name. There you go... in this life.
<br><br>

BR:  I&rsquo;m
taking up valuable time here... because we&rsquo;re under some
limited time because Bob&rsquo;s in demand, as I just said, and he&rsquo;s
got to rush off to his next appointment.

<br><br>

One of the
reasons why this is an important conversation is because yesterday
afternoon at the Exopolitics Summit when Bob Dean was giving what I
have put on our website and described as <I>the most magnificent
presentation at any UFO conference that I have ever heard,</I> and
I&rsquo;ll say this again on record. It&rsquo;s fabulous and you&rsquo;ll
be linked to that here.

<br><br>

He was
affirming the reality of bases on the Moon and Mars and showing us
photographs that have never been shown before, as least as far as I&rsquo;m
aware, and it&rsquo;s extremely important testimony. In a minute Bob
will tell people, I&rsquo;m quite sure, how he feels now that he is
&ldquo;under orders&rdquo; from someone, somewhere, to speak out like
he hasn&rsquo;t spoken out before. We salute you for that. This is a
very brave thing that you&rsquo;re doing and it&rsquo;s incredibly
important.

<br><br>

One of the
things that links the three witnesses that we have here&mdash;we can
call you witnesses&mdash;is something we could dub <I>The Martian
Connection</I>, and with that, I&rsquo;m going to hand over to Kerry
because I&rsquo;m talking too much already. Kerry...

<br><br>

KC:  Okay,
well, just hold on one second. Let&rsquo;s let Arthur...
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Just something really simple, before it slips my mind. I was just
sitting in the audience during the conference and the cameraman<B>
</B>was next to me and something popped up on the news that
was on C-Span that I sent you, and I just wanted to remind about
that. It was one of the astronauts was talking about this too.

<br><br>

KC:  Buzz
Aldrin was talking about having what was a...
<br><br>

HD/AN:  A
monolith on one of the moons of Mars.
<br><br>

KC:  A
monolith on the Moon.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
And that just popped up in the last couple, three days.
<br><br>

KC:  On
the Moon?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
No, on Phobos.
<br><br>

KC:  Oh.
On Phobos, on the moon of Mars, right. Okay. And you knew that,
right?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, no, I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that. No.
<br><br>

KC:  You
weren&rsquo;t?
<br><br>

HD/AN:  I
didn&rsquo;t...

<br><br>

KC:  But
you told us about a monolith at one point. Do you recall that?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yes. I have. Uh huh.

<br><br>

BR:  That
was a different monolith. They&rsquo;re all over the place.
<br><br>

KC:  There
you go. [laughs]
<br><br>

HD/AN:  I
was hoping that you&rsquo;d have a chance to see Arthur Clarke
several years ago.
<br><br>

KC:  Oh,
we wish!
<br><br>

HD/AN:
But, it just didn&rsquo;t work out.
<br><br>

BR:  It
didn&rsquo;t work out.
<br><br>

KC:
Actually, it&rsquo;s interesting you mention him because we just
talked to another whistleblower this morning and he knew Arthur
Clarke, also, so the two of you have something else in common.

<br><br>

HD/AN:  Mm
hm.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay,
so here we are. I&rsquo;m Kerry Cassidy, this is Bill Ryan. We&rsquo;re
Project Camelot, for those of you that don&rsquo;t know, and this is
going to be just some open conversation. What we want to do is talk
about the future, because what this really is, is what we call a
<I>Futuretalk</I>. It is a conversation. That means Bill and I are
going do something really annoying -- we&rsquo;re going to talk from
time to time, more than normal.

<br><br>

But, we
really want to hear from you guys. And what we&rsquo;d like to talk
about is your visions of what&rsquo;s coming in the future, in the
fairly-near future ideally, but you can go as far out as you&rsquo;d
like. And why don&rsquo;t we start with Alfred Webre?
<br><br>

AW:   Oh,
thank you. Well, I see the future as being shaped by two fundamental
forces, perhaps three. One [is] a series of cosmic cycles which are
sychronistically happening at the same time during solar cycle 24,
which is 2009 to 2020, with the solar maximum being around 2013...
2012 to 2013.

<br><br>

[Two], the
Time Acceleration Matrix, which is an adaptation of the Mayan
calendar, so that as we move into 2011, the black hole at the center
of the Galaxy, which really mediates a lot of our thoughts, will be
slipping over into Universal Consciousness, non-dualism.

<br><br>

And
finally, what some people call &ldquo;Galactic genetic engineering.&rdquo;
That is the power of the black hole at the center of the Galaxy
really kicking in to activate our DNA, ninety-seven percent of which,
I understand, is not active now&mdash;they call it &ldquo;junk&rdquo;.
<br><br>

BD:  They
call it junk, but it isn&rsquo;t junk.
<br><br>

AW:
Right, exactly. So, these are all sort of raising the capacity of not
only the human beings, but of all living things, to a new frequency,
a new understanding, a new kind of social contract, if you want to
put it that way.
<br><br>

KC:  Yeah,
and I think, Arthur, you could, maybe, talk to that because you might
have a different... I don&rsquo;t know if you call yourself a
physicist officially.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
No, no.
<br><br>

KC:  But,
you certainly have some expertise in that area.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, I don&rsquo;t have expertise. But, in some of what you just
said, you took some of the words out of my mouth, so you already said
some of what I would have said about all these, well, as David
Wilcock&rsquo;s talking. He&rsquo;s making a movie called
<I>Convergence</I>, and this is what&rsquo;s happening. All these
various things are all just converging.

<br><br>

I was
looking at a little child yesterday, a little girl, and seeing her
eyes and I just... I could see the difference, you know, of the next
generations. You can see it, even in someone, maybe, 20 years old,
that they&rsquo;re already very advanced, consciously advanced.
<br><br>

BR:
Arthur, when we met you for the first time, which is almost three
years ago, I remember very, very clearly that this is one of the
first things that you told us. You said the big issue right now is
that everything is happening at once or just about to.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yes.
<br><br>

BR:  Can
you delineate, can you list, what are those factors that are
happening at once? Just so people know what we&rsquo;re looking for.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, the physical factors already just mentioned:  The cyclic
factors, very long cycles and short cycles; the effect of the star,
the Sun, here... the spectral changes in the Sun, and things that I
guess can&rsquo;t be measured. I don&rsquo;t know. For me, it&rsquo;s
an intuitive type of feeling and not a scientific thing. I&rsquo;m
not sure.
<br><br>

BR:  But,
there are things that you have been briefed on.
<br><br>

KC:  Well,
you&rsquo;ve already talked the environment. You talked about what
was planned in terms of viruses that were planted around the world,
sort of like time bombs somewhat. And you also talked about a
roll-out that would affect our economy, etc., etc.



HD/AN:
Well, these are different from the changes... Okay, I mentioned
<I>Novelty Theory</I>, which Terence McKenna, who&rsquo;s deceased
now, who lived on the Big Island of Hawaii, I believe. He talked
about, he had, I guess, a calculation for it, and that mathematical
equation can be found on the Internet, I guess. And you can see that
it comes down to zero at 2012 approximately, from what I remember.
<br><br>

KC:  And
that means what? That novelty goes down to zero?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, Novelty. It becomes <I>more</I> novel, in my opinion.

<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah. To me it means more novel... well, <I>novel</I> to me means --
I would laugh, you know, about it, but it&rsquo;s not -- I don&rsquo;t
have the words. I don&rsquo;t have the ability to put things into
words that some of these gentlemen do, to put things in words.
<br><br>

BR:  Let
me interpret this for you, then you can check my reflection.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
All right.
<br><br>

BR:  I
read a book called <I>Future Shock</I> by Alvin Toffler many, many
years ago, who said that the rate of change is accelerating.
<br><br>

HD/AN:  Oh
yeah.
<br><br>

BR:  So,
you&rsquo;ve got a logarithmic change here, such that <I>everything</I>
is starting to change.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Exactly.
<br><br>

BR:  And
it&rsquo;s like there are statistics, which I can&rsquo;t quote off
hand, but it&rsquo;s like 99 percent of all the innovations in human
history have happened in the last year.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah.
<br><br>

BR:  Or
something like that. And the whole thing is going vertical.

<br><br>

HD/AN:  My
feeling is that, as of about two months ago, just because there&rsquo;s
no direct marker, that maybe two months ago, when I started weaning
myself off of morphine for four years...
<br><br>

BR:
Because? You were on morphine because...? Just for the record.
<br><br>

HD/AN:  I
don&rsquo;t know how to say it. They couldn&rsquo;t come up with any
lab tests that were conclusive, so it was by exclusion, and they said
it was just a peripheral neuropathy and exhaustion. But, that all
happened suddenly when I left my last classified work, just coincided
with that. What it means, nobody knows; there&rsquo;s some guessing.
<br><br>

BD:  Isn&rsquo;t
that an interesting coincidence?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yes.
<br><br>

KC:  I was
going to say: <I>what a coincidence!</I>
<br><br>

HD/AN:
But, when I said good-bye suddenly and ran away, instead of them
controlling me, and then, I had this shock, shocks to my system.

<br><br>

But, the
thing is, about two months ago, something in my subconscious... I had
just been waiting patiently, basically in bed in this room for three
or four years in severe pain, screaming in pain every day almost...
and Bill experienced pushing me around in a wheelchair one time. But,
I thought: <I>Just be patient. Be patient, </I>and, using the mind, I
got through that.

<br><br>

Then, two
months ago, something told me: <I>You have to stop this. No one else
is going to wean you off this medicine.</I> So, I made a spreadsheet
out and every hour of the day that I was taking it, because I lost of
track of how much I was taking. It was like 180 milligrams of
morphine, probably, a day. It was out of control. And so something
said: <I>You need to wean yourself off now...</I> and I don&rsquo;t
wish that on anyone to do that.

<br><br>

But, I got
off slowly and two days, approximately two days before, all of a
sudden, the Zurich Conference happened, which was a week or so ago? I
had just weaned myself off and I didn&rsquo;t even know about going
to the conference or anything. It just happened. So the timing is
such that it&rsquo;s a message to me that, yeah, now&rsquo;s the time
when everything starts to really move quickly.
<br><br>

KC:
Arthur, I have to say actually two months ago, I would agree with you
that there seemed to be a transition that happened. There&rsquo;s
nothing marked in terms of in the news but there was a sense that
things started escalating, almost like rolling downhill quicker. That
was the sense I got and it&rsquo;s interesting that you say that. And
you did; you sort of came awake and started on this sort of move that
has put you on stage twice now.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
But something... something&rsquo;s happened to where something that
was incurable... just, all of a sudden, I&rsquo;m coming back to
normal.

<br><br>

AW:   From
the point of view of the Time Acceleration Matrix, that would have
been the sixth day of the Galactic Era, and, in this particular
window, which goes from November &rsquo;08 to November &rsquo;09,
there are many, many sorts of breakthroughs.

<br><br>

So, if
we&rsquo;re all feeling that general breakthrough feeling in our
individual lives, that may be coming from the programming put out by
the electromagnetic emanations from the black hole at the center of
the Galaxy that the Mayans called <I>Hunab-Ku</I>, which is the
center of all things.

<br><br>

I see --
and this to ask in particular of Bob Dean and Arthur, because they&rsquo;ve
dealt so much with the area of secrecy -- I find myself as one who
did not come up in the culture of secrecy, but see secrecy as one of
the most powerful forces between the Open Culture and this breakaway
civilization that is the Secret Civilization.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
found one of the most consciousness-raising aspects, to me, is to
hear of secrets, like the teleportation corridors to Mars, like the
forward positions on Mars, the stargates to Australia. To just begin
to see all of these secret programs is really
consciousness-expanding.

<br><br>

KC:  Well,
exactly. Information... I mean the information itself, just to hear
it, like what happened for these people yesterday on stage when you
were showing photographs that were really revolutionary, because they
had been hidden for so long. And then to have a person who actually
would get up on stage and say: <I>I&rsquo;ve been to Mars and here I
am -- a human.</I> That was, I think, mind-expanding for the audience
in ways that we won&rsquo;t be able to even trace.
<br><br>

BR:  It&rsquo;s
historical, no?
<br><br>

KC:  Yeah.
And, obviously, I don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;ll go out around
the world other than because Camelot will do our bit, right? But,
this is the kind of thing that changes consciousness. And one of the
things I have to say is that consciousness changes drastically, all
of a sudden. It&rsquo;s not like a slow, gradual... it goes along,
goes along, and, from what I understand, change actually happens like
that [makes hand gesture of 90-degree turn upward].

<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, even greater and faster than logarithmic, is my feeling.
<br><br>

BR:  The
step changes.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, I don&rsquo;t know if the step changes or not. I don&rsquo;t
know if it&rsquo;s like that or not. But it... digitized or not.
<br><br>

KC:  So
Bob, what would you say? Because you have kind of a little more
pragmatic view -- correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, along with the
spiritual insight -- but, I think you&rsquo;re seeing these changes
or you know of things that are coming down the pike that are very
pragmatic for peoples&rsquo; lives.
<br><br>

BD:  Well,
I found secrecy, actually, to be corrosive to the human soul and
that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I have been speaking out so bluntly
and so loudly over the last few years.

<br><br>

I noticed
among the masses of people that I&rsquo;ve confronted in conferences
here and there, an over-riding sense of fear, and the secrecy had
been taking its toll on those people. They were fearful and they
didn&rsquo;t believe they had a future. They began to think there was
no future, that we&rsquo;re all doomed.

<br><br>

And one of
the reasons I came to this conference&mdash;and I gave it a lot of
thought before I accepted the invitation, because I don&rsquo;t like
traveling anymore. I really don&rsquo;t like flying in airplanes
anymore.

<br><br>

I came
here to, I think, alleviate in one small way the secrecy that I had
observed that was corrosive to the human soul, and I wanted to tell
the people in this audience in particular... to meet some people like
Alfred here, who is a man I&rsquo;ve respected and admired for years.
There is hope in spite of all the darkness, in spite of all of the
fear.

<br><br>

I would
like to say to the people who are interested and listening that there
is a tomorrow. There is a future, and they and their children and
their grandchildren and so on, the generations yet to come, do,
indeed, have a future and it&rsquo;s glorious. They&rsquo;ve got to
hold on to that spark of belief. They&rsquo;ve got to hold on to that
hope.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
why I quoted Tolstoy yesterday when I was speaking, when he mentioned
that there is something within the human spirit that will prevail and
endure. There&rsquo;s a spark that&rsquo;s burning in the human heart
that will not go out, no matter how dark the world ever becomes.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
tried in my small way to convey that to the people. And I was so
gratified at the response that I got. They&rsquo;ve come up to me,
literally by the hundreds. I mean, I say this in no negative intent,
but they haven&rsquo;t let me alone!

<br><br>

The idea
that I said something hopeful in telling them they do have a
tomorrow, [that] they have a future, that their children and
grandchildren will go to the stars... that is the one thing that they
need to hold onto. There is a future. There is a destiny for the
human race in the stars. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here. That&rsquo;s
why I came to add my small two or three cents to this whole thing.
<br><br>

KC:  Well,
I would also say that another thing that you tell them is that they
have a right to know.
<br><br>

BD:  Oh
God, they do indeed!
<br><br>

KC:  And I
think that just gets a fire burning inside them.
<br><br>

BD:  Well,
I&rsquo;ve been furious. The fire burning inside of me has erupted
several times, and it&rsquo;s dangerous. My very nature... back when
I was an infantryman for years and years and years, I was not a
gentle man. You pushed my buttons, pushed me just a little too far, I
had the tendency to become somewhat explosive and, need I say, I had
a tendency to be a little bit dangerous.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
one of the reasons why the Black Ops people have left me alone.
[Kerry laughs] Because I put the word out that... you know, I had
been followed in black sedans for a long time. At night I had the
midnight phone calls. I had the black helicopters over my house.

<br><br>

I put out
the word that I was a veteran of two wars. I suffered from Post
Traumatic Stress Syndrome, and I could not be trusted emotionally;
and if you push me a little too far, I was an expert marksman and I
carried a gun. Beware, you know, you mess with me, I might end up
shooting a bunch of you guys.

<br><br>

And you
know, the black limousines stopped following me, the black
helicopters disappeared, and the midnight phone calls stopped. So,
the word evidently got out that... don&rsquo;t push this old bastard,
because he can be dangerous, you see?
<br><br>

KC:
Except you also had White Hats behind you.
<br><br>

BD:  Oh
listen! Let me tell you, honey, I have a lot of good friends in high
places, and I admitted at this conference things I&rsquo;ve never
admitted publicly before. I do, indeed, have good friends in high
places and I say that with a little bit of tongue in cheek because
these high places...
<br><br>

KC:  They
go up and up and up.
<br><br>

BD:  They
go out and out and out, yeah.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah. The conference... You know, for the last few weeks the
ones&mdash;whatever they are&mdash;the invisible part of the whole
thing is... whatever it is, it&rsquo;s very powerful and everyone
feels it in the conference. In the conferences, they&rsquo;re all
expressing the same feelings, I think, at least 98 percent.
<br><br>

BD:
Arthur, the human race is a work in progress.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah.
<br><br>

BD:  And
who has been running this experiment? [points upward]
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Who&rsquo;s been running...? Yes, well, but they&rsquo;ve given us
the freedom, too, at the same time.
<br><br>

BD:  Oh,
well, you know, we&rsquo;re an adolescent species.
We haven&rsquo;t quite graduated yet.

<br><br>

HD/AN:  We
just need to learn that we&rsquo;re to work as a family instead of
fighting each other.
<br><br>

BD:  We
are not quite adults yet. We are troublesome adolescents almost on
the edge of being adults... but we&rsquo;re going to make it.
<br><br>

AW:  Now,
just to pick up this thread here, of secrets, and of the
deconstruction in making public the secrets, yesterday here at the
Summit, the high point of the Summit was when, after Bob spoke, and
revealed a number of fundamental secrets, Arthur came on the stage
spontaneously and also revealed a number of secrets.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Not much.
<br><br>

AW:   No,
but I mean...
<br><br>

KC:
Enough.
<br><br>

AW:   In
context, it was a revelation that our Solar System is inhabited and
that Earth is part of the functioning social system. And that was the
high point of this conference. Literally the consciousness of the
conference was raised.
<br><br>

KC:  A
complete change.
<br><br>

AW:   Yes,
and that was acknowledged&mdash;right?&mdash;by people. People
acknowledged that. I think, just as you were coming in, it was
acknowledged. So, if we take this, ending the secrecy, I think is
going to be an important function of the consciousness-raising, and
having Henry and Bob come forth in settings like this to reveal
secrets which they&rsquo;ve lived with for so many years is like a
baptism to the people, and an empowerment.
<br><br>

BR:  Yes.
<br><br>

AW:
Because secrets are disempowering.
<br><br>

KC:
That&lsquo;s right.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Bob was a chief soul for me, because I spoke to Bob privately just
momentarily, because he&rsquo;d been very busy with all these other
people wanting to talk with him, and we have some common connections
throughout time, different places we worked... in Belgium and such,
and other places.

<br><br>

And we
both have an Army background, enlisted, and just different places at
different times. But you&rsquo;re like... it was a confirmation to
me, you know. I finally met someone that, you know, could kind of
reinforce my background. And -- before -- I felt alone, you know.
<br><br>

BD:
There, there. You&rsquo;re in good hands. You&rsquo;re in good hands.
[laughter]

<br><br>

This
experience for me has been, and I say this not with any animosity,
but this experience has been for me like a Catholic going to
confession. [laughter] You know, they say that confession is good for
your soul.

<br><br>

Well,
speaking bluntly on secrecy and some things that have been covered up
for so long, I felt an overwhelming wave of relief to have finally
gone public on a couple of things that I have found to be factual and
true. One of them is that deep underground facility outside of Las
Vegas where this Air Force Colonel friend of mine went through one
door in Nevada, and in two minutes, he was in Pine Gap, Australia.

<br><br>

Now, that
kind of secrecy, that technology that allows that to happen, stuns
people. <I>Do you mean that we&rsquo;ve done that? We&rsquo;ve got
that? We can do things like that? What have they been keeping from
us?</I>
<br><br>

KC:  Okay,
well...
<br><br>

HD/AN:  I
don&rsquo;t like flashing credentials or anything, but it&rsquo;s my
credentials.  Inside this passport that I stole from my job, there
just happens to be a... what do you call it here?

<br><br>

KC:  A
stamp?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
It&rsquo;s so simple.
<br><br>

BR:  Can
you show it to the camera?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
It&rsquo;s a stamp in here that says: <I>The bearer is a member of
the civilian component as defined by Article One of the Agreement
between Australia and United States forces in Australia signed at
</I><I>Canberra</I><I> on May 9, 1963.
</I>It&rsquo;s just one of the visas, you know, in this passport.
This one&rsquo;s for Japan.
<br><br>

BR:  Could
you show just the front of the passport for the camera? It&rsquo;s a
brown cover, official passport. It&rsquo;s not a normal passport.
<br><br>

KC:  And
we do want to say for the camera that we&rsquo;ve actually been to...
I can&rsquo;t say we went inside, but to the outside of this person&rsquo;s
place of work, one of them. I&rsquo;m not going to say where on the
globe it was or anything else, so don&rsquo;t worry, Arthur. But I
will say that we have gotten substantial verification that Arthur is
who he says he is.
<br><br>

BR:  I
would say total verification as far as we&rsquo;re able to.
<br><br>

KC:  And
it was quite extraordinary.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Actually I tried... I encouraged them, wherever this place was at one
point that we traveled, I encouraged them to come and meet the
security people who I knew by first name and they were kind of
reluctant to do that [laughs] at that point.
<br><br>

BR:  That
was when we were a little more nervous than we are now. What we did
do, just for the record... it was quite fun. We accompanied Arthur
into a bar where the local employees in this establishment would go
in the evenings, and we just sat in a corner and watched all his old
colleagues welcome him and say: <I>Hey, we haven&rsquo;t seen you for
a while</I>. And that was quite fun to do that.
<br><br>

KC:  Yeah.
<br><br>

BR:
Anyway... I&rsquo;m a little concerned here, Bob, that you were
interrupted just now because you were telling the story about two
things that you felt gave you a great sense of relief when you
disclosed them yesterday. One of them was the reality of the
stargate, the portal, the wormhole, the jump room, the network so
that you could one moment be in Area 51, the next moment in Pine Gap.
And that prompted Arthur to show his Australian visa in his ... Was
it a visa?
<br><br>

HD/A:
It&rsquo;s a visa.
<br><br>

KC:  More
than that.
<br><br>

BR:  And
the second thought? Please continue, because I want to hear this one.
<br><br>

BD:  It&rsquo;s
a matter of interest to me and it always has been, that one of the
largest national security agency facilities in the world is at Pine
Gap, but what most people have no understanding of is that
underground at Pine Gap is one of the largest extraterrestrial
facilities on the planet! Our remote viewers have been looking in on
that place for years and years and years.

<br><br>

And what I
found terribly amusing -- not that there&rsquo;s that much humor in
this whole damn thing -- but that facility in Australia at Pine Gap
apparently is an extraterrestrial R &amp; R center. And people say:
<I>What do you mean, R &amp; R?</I> It&rsquo;s a military term
meaning rest and relaxation.

<br><br>

And I
thought, how obvious, you know. It makes sense. Aliens are here,
having to deal with the human race, they <I>need</I> rest and
relaxation.
<br><br>

BR:  They
need some...
<br><br>

BD:  I
deal with the human race and <I>I</I> need rest and relaxation! Which
is what I&rsquo;m going to get when I go home tomorrow, you see. But
I found it amusing, out of all the four major facilities on the
planet, the one in Australia is an R &amp; R center for the guys from
out there.
<br><br>

BR:
Arthur, have you been there? Or would you rather fix me with a steely
eye and not answer?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, let&rsquo;s talk about something else! [laughter]
<br><br>

KC:  Well,
let me say that you were nodding, so I thought that was...
<br><br>

HD/AN:  I
would like to say something -- it&rsquo;s just simple -- that may be
slightly off course here, but a couple of things. One is we&rsquo;re
talking about secrets and stuff, that a lot of stuff gets classified
&ldquo;Secret&rdquo; or whatever; just because you&rsquo;ve got a
stamp there and you have to do something with it. [Kerry laughs] You
know, it&rsquo;s not...
<br><br>

BD:
They&rsquo;ve gone wild with it. They&rsquo;ve gone mad.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
And they stamp everything and it gets filed away and then it has to
get declassified, you know. It&rsquo;s just routine to stamp
everything.
<br><br>

BD:  The
Navy keeps secrets from the Army. The Army keeps secrets from the Air
Force. The FBI keeps secrets from the CIA, and that all led to 9/11.
That&rsquo;s where the secrecy leads, to disasters like that.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah. And the thing is, someone needs to interface between all these
different groups and try and help them to communicate with each other
while respecting their own boundaries.
<br><br>

KC:  And
are you willing to agree with me that you were one of those people
that kind of crossed some of those lines?
<br><br>

HD/A:
Yes. Yeah.

<br><br>

KC:
Between the various agencies?
<br><br>

HD/A:
Yes. My &ldquo;customers&rdquo; were the whole spectrum.
<br><br>

KC:
Which is why you kind of have the level of knowledge about the
overall big picture, as we call it.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a big picture person and always a general
person and not focused in one area. And I didn&rsquo;t ask for it,
believe me. It just happened. You know, you just get a phone call and
you just... nothing else but a phone call: <I>Would you like a job?
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Okay. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Well, you just
have to be patient and find out. </I>It&rsquo;s that kind of thing.

<br><br>

The other
thing is at some levels, people are saying that the governments --
like the presidents or whatever, or the leaders of the country --
should release these secrets. But they haven&rsquo;t had access to
this information. They get the tours of certain things, but it&rsquo;s
very limited. They get to see blinking lights or whatever, like...
you know, and that&rsquo;s as far as it goes, as far as I&rsquo;ve
ever been aware.

<br><br>

BD:
Arthur, the incident involving President Carter some years ago, where
the President of the United States was told by the Director of
Central Intelligence: <I>Mr. President, you don&rsquo;t have a high
enough security classification for us to tell you all this
information and, sir, you don&rsquo;t have a need to know.</I>

<br><br>

Now, who
was the Director of Central Intelligence at that moment? George
Herbert Walker Bush, who became President -- that&rsquo;s how damn
bad it&rsquo;s become over the years. That&rsquo;s how corrosive
secrecy can be, not merely to the human soul, but to the
constitutional system of government. It&rsquo;s corrosive as hell and
it&rsquo;s got to stop! And I know you agree with me.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yes, the fear thing&rsquo;s got to stop and we need to alleviate the
fear for people, because all of these things, most of the things that
we see in the press, are just created and planned long ago --
fictitious enemies.

<br><br>

There <I>are</I>
enemies, but a lot of them are manufactured and some of them aren&rsquo;t
even real. Okay? And there&rsquo;s a long list, and they&rsquo;re
almost at the end of their list. They&rsquo;re at the very end of
their list now, the timing, so there&rsquo;s nothing else, no more
rabbits to pull out of the hat.

<br><br>

KC: Wait a
second. I want to actually say... [to Arthur] what was your level of
clearance? Because his [Bob Dean] was Cosmic Top Secret.

<br><br>

HD/A:
Cosmic Top Secret, because that&rsquo;s a NATO classification.

<br><br>

BD:
That&rsquo;s NATO. And there are levels above that. There are two &ldquo;Q&rdquo;
clearances above that.
<br><br>

KC:  You
had a &ldquo;Q&rdquo;.
<br><br>

HD/A:  My
first one was a &ldquo;Q&rdquo; clearance, with certain letters.
<br><br>

BD:
Special Access Programs.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah, but it was &ldquo;Q&rdquo; clearance and that was through the
Department of Energy, it was the Energy Research and Development
Agency. Before that, it was the Atomic Energy Commission, and they
keep changing names and you have to keep reprinting the paperwork and
everything. I don&rsquo;t know why.

<br><br>

But, yeah,
it was a &ldquo;Q&rdquo; clearance, and then it went to... basically
from there it varied. It went up and down from Secret up to Top
Secret and over a period of 30 years or more. And then it ended up
with Top Secret SCI and then Top Secret with a bunch of letters which
I still... I don&rsquo;t know. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. But they
were... it was basically...
<br><br>

KC:
You&rsquo;re not sure if you can&rsquo;t say what it was.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah... It doesn&rsquo;t matter. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
<br><br>

BR:  I
would like to ask&mdash;because this is sort of meant to be a
<I>Futuretalk</I> as it were... I fully understand and agree with you
when you talk about the agenda of hyping up fear in order to make
people more easily controllable. But let&rsquo;s ask the three of
you: What is worth being concerned about and what is a distraction?

<br><br>

What
should we be focused on as issues for the human race in the next few
years? And what just is something that is a misdirect, like a
magician on a stage that we shouldn&rsquo;t even be worried about,
but they&rsquo;re trying to get us to think that way? How can you
separate these things out for people? This is a really important
opportunity to make a statement.
<br><br>

BD:
Alfred probably is best qualified to answer that.
<br><br>

AW:
Well, as a general answer to that, I would say that anything
associated with the current world economy, which is an economy based
on the manipulation of the dialectic of enemies, is a fundamental
distraction, so that the entirety of the arms race, the entirety of
the strategic balance of forces using threat of war, is a
distraction.
<br><br>

BR:  So,
don&rsquo;t fall for the war rhetoric?
<br><br>

AW:
Right. And number two, the area that these gentlemen have worked in,
I think, is the cutting edge of human consciousness moving to the
next level and that is...
<br><br>

HD/AN:  I
think it&rsquo;s you [who are] working in the area of human
consciousness!
<br><br>

AW:
Well, no, but understanding that an extraterrestrial presence is not
just an abstraction, but, rather, it&rsquo;s a human race very much
like our own...

<br><br>

HD/AN:
It&rsquo;s an extension of our family.
<br><br>

AW:
Yeah...that lives under the surface of <I>Mars</I>, with whom our
secret government now has contact.

<br><br>

And so we
have rights, we have inherent rights in the same way I think under
natural law, which will invoke that, which were expressed in the
Declaration of Independence of the US.

<br><br>

They were
expressed in the US Constitution, the Canadian Charter of Rights, in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, various documents in our
terrestrial human culture. And those include rights as sovereign
citizens in the universe. Therefore, if our governments are now
engaged in long term... I mean these things go back at least 20 or 30
years. That&rsquo;s just from people who I&rsquo;ve talked to.
<br><br>

KC:
Treaties have been made...
<br><br>

HD/AN:  I
have to remind you that the &ldquo;governments&rdquo;... it&rsquo;s
not the Presidents and down, or the queen and down. It&rsquo;s
agencies <I>above</I> that. So, you can&rsquo;t blame the governments
that we normally call governments.
<br><br>

AW:   No,
no. Sure. But, whether or not they are <I>supra</I> governments, they
are still subject to natural law and universal law, and they can be
called before a court empowered under natural law to stand trial for
war crimes. But we don&rsquo;t want to go that direction. The
direction that we want to go is to have that secret world become
transparent, and integrated with our
world, for which we have an inherent right under natural law.

<br><br>

BR:  Bob,
you have your hand raised. You wanted to say something?
<br><br>

BD:  I
simply must apologize that I have an appointment I accepted for an
interview in about five minutes and I do want to say I&rsquo;m sorry,
but I will have to take leave of you illustrious personalities here
for a while. I have to go. I&rsquo;m sorry, Kerry.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
It&rsquo;s okay. Is there anything you want to say before you leave,
Bob, about the end of secrecy and the beginning of what&rsquo;s
coming next? Because just as I went to get you today, you were
addressing a group and you said there&rsquo;s going to be in the next
12 to 18 months some things that people need to prepare for.
<br><br>

BD:  Yeah.
Well, the gentleman I was talking to was an economist and a bit of a
banker and he&rsquo;s been looking at the statistics, the data, and
he&rsquo;s been watching what&rsquo;s been going on in the world
markets and he&rsquo;s troubled by what he sees. He&rsquo;s convinced
that we&rsquo;re not out of the woods yet on this economic thing. He
asked me what did I honestly think the next year or so had coming?

<br><br>

I said, as
I said yesterday, we&rsquo;re in for some bad times. We have not seen
the worst of it yet, and I hate to tell you that, but that&rsquo;s
true. We have not seen the worst. The other shoe has not dropped yet.

<br><br>

The only
thing I can tell you is that, within the next year and a half, we&rsquo;re
in for some events on the world scale that is going to make 9/11 pale
in comparison. And that is sad and tragic.

<br><br>

But to
leave you with this, I must leave you on an up-note for the viewers
who will be seeing this and as Tolstoy said: There is that spark that
burns deep within each of us. It will not go out, no matter how dark
the world becomes.

<br><br>

I want to
leave this with the people who will see this tape: There is a
tomorrow, the future of this species is glorious; it <I>is</I> in the
stars. And they&rsquo;ve got to have hope and not be afraid. That&rsquo;s
all I can say in closing.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
Thank you, Bob.
<br><br>

BD:  Thank
you, sweetheart.
<br><br>

KC:  It&rsquo;s
an honor, as always.
<br><br>

BR:
Thanks so much, Bob.
<br><br>

BD:  It&rsquo;s
always a pleasure. Read this gentleman&rsquo;s book. [Ed. note:
Alfred Webre, <I>Exopolitics: Politics, Government, and Law in the
Universe]</I>
<br><br>

KC:
Absolutely. Yes. Well, I&rsquo;ve read his work. Actually I read his
book a long time ago. Before the organization of Exopolitics was ever
created, this man had the vision of something.
<br><br>

BD:  He&rsquo;s
a true visionary.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yes.
<br><br>

KC:  Oh
yes, absolutely. I don&rsquo;t think people even realize that that
this man is a true <I>futurist</I>, actually.
<br><br>

BD:  Well,
if someone would be kind enough...
<br><br>

KC:  And,
he should be listened to in that way, because what he says today is
not often not understood, but I think it&rsquo;s always the kind of
thing that years in advance, years later, they&rsquo;re going to say
he was one of the first, if not <I>the</I> first, in certain areas.
It&rsquo;s a gift.
<br><br>

BD:  We
need our prophets and we need our visionaries. And here sits one.
<br><br>

KC:
That&rsquo;s right.
<br><br>

HD/AN:  I
just feel that we need to realize that the rest of our family has
been here visiting us, and also slightly off the planet, and other
places in there. They&rsquo;re interested in watching and they would
not have survived as long as they have if they hadn&rsquo;t gone
through this transition that we&rsquo;re about to go through. And so,
you have to realize that they&rsquo;re friendly and not evil, mean
creatures out there like in some science fiction movies.
<br><br>

BR:  All
of them?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Anyone that&rsquo;s survived. Generally, anyone&rsquo;s that survived
that&rsquo;s worthwhile, I mean, the majority. Otherwise they would
have destroyed themselves by now.
<br><br>

BR:  Yeah.
You&rsquo;re not saying that 100% of the extraterrestrials races are
friendly.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, they have a different way of... they have a different way.
<br><br>

KC:  Some
are service-to-self; some are service-to-others. Service-to-self
actually means that they... what you&rsquo;re... what they&rsquo;re...
because you haven&rsquo;t actually met them all, right?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
No, that&rsquo;s impossible.
<br><br>

KC:   You
were only exposed to a few.

<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah. I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about particular groups. But, the
thing is that in general... I mean, there was this Type 0 that was
talked about, and Type 1? They wouldn&rsquo;t have survived this
Type-0-to-Type-1 transition if they hadn&rsquo;t raised their
consciousness to some degree.

<br><br>

In
general, that&rsquo;s the case. And, then, it may have been some
exceptions, but they&rsquo;re such a minority that...  [Ed note:
Just google &ldquo; Kardashev scale &rdquo; to learn more about the
&ldquo;Type 0&rdquo; theory.]
<br><br>

KC:  Well,
actually, our government, their liaison, is often with these
service-to-self.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah. That&rsquo;s right.
<br><br>

BR:  And
the evil forces on this planet aren&rsquo;t doing it all on their
own, right? They didn&rsquo;t think up all this stuff on their own.
<br><br>

KC:  We,
actually&hellip; <I>humanity</I> isn&rsquo;t doing it all on their
own. They&rsquo;re being pushed and prodded by some unseen forces and
unseen beings. It may be a philosophical difference.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
It&rsquo;s a philosophical difference. That&rsquo;s what it is, yeah.
<br><br>

BR:  By
recognizing their existence, I&rsquo;m not giving them power. I&rsquo;m
just saying we&rsquo;ve got to tell the truth here. There is evil out
there in the universe. It doesn&rsquo;t just stop at the Illuminati.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, there&rsquo;s darkness, but darkness is for me... I view it as
ignorance or, ultimately, the absence of light. It&rsquo;s not an
opposing force, ultimately. There&rsquo;s light and then there&rsquo;s
no light, or the interference...
<br><br>

BR:  I was
talking about functionality here.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
So, maybe, we can actually... even you could talk about, Alfred, what
we&rsquo;ve been talking about off camera a little bit, in terms of
there <I>is</I> investigation at the moment going into some of the
relationships that are going on behind the scenes with various races.
<br><br>

AW:   Yes.
Sure. Just to keep it down to specific data-points, we know what
Arthur has said here, that he&rsquo;s been to Mars. We also have
another very credible whistleblower who we&rsquo;ve talked about, who
in 1980, went to Mars twice.
<br><br>

BR:  This
is Andrew Basiago.
<br><br>

AW:   Yes,
in the company of a CIA officer, Courtney Hunt, just to put that on
the record, through a Mars jump room, a teleportation jump room, from
El Segundo, California, to one of the sort of bunker-type bases right
out on the surface of Mars, and who walked around on the surface of
Mars.

<br><br>

And, who
in 1971, in the company of his father, who was a CIA contract officer
type, met three Martian astronauts who were on a liaison and
coordination visit at Curtis Wright Air Force
Base. [This reference is unclear. Google: Curtiss-Wright is a
manufacturer of jet fighter aircraft. In the Barcelona panel
discussion, he called this <I>Wright
AFB in New Jersey</I>. There is no
listing for that in NJ, although there is a McGuire AFB in
Wrightstown, NJ. Otherwise, there is Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio.]

<br><br>

So we know
that from at least 1971, there&rsquo;s been a coordinating and
liaison type function for relationship between the Martians and the
U.S. government.

<br><br>

Well, from
what I&rsquo;ve read, the Martian civilization is a positive, ethical
civilization. So, to counteract, our strategy should be as citizens
to encourage an open strategic alliance between our culture, our Open
Culture, and the Martian culture, and to make that available
immediately at the highest level, which is a Presidential
acknowledgement of the existence and relationship with the
civilization on Mars.
<br><br>

BR:  And
that&rsquo;s one of the founding principles of Exopolitics.
<br><br>

AW:
Exactly.
<br><br>

KC:  Yeah,
but I would like to say that you [Arthur] are nodding, so you&rsquo;re
kind of recognizing some of the testimony...
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yes. I never heard of this until now, this person or anything, and
it&rsquo;s like: Ah! Someone else! You know?
<br><br>

BR:
Another one... yeah.
<br><br>

HD/AN:  It
sounds like a very similar kind of work, too. Very similar.
<br><br>

KC:  But,
I would like to say -- and I&rsquo;m throwing this out here -- I am
familiar, because I&rsquo;ve had some personal contact with some,
what I know of as Anunnaki, and that there are some positive Anunnaki
and there are some more negatively oriented. You know, just like
there are humans, good and bad, you know, there are different
Anunnaki.

<br><br>

And I have
to say that they&rsquo;re interacting with individuals, because I
have had some interaction. They have made their presence known to me.
And I know Bob isn&rsquo;t here to actually talk about this, but Bob
has had his own interaction with Anunnaki that he has talked about
with us, and I think he met them.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Well, the Anunnaki are the exception that I was talking about where
it&rsquo;s... but I really didn&rsquo;t have any time to even really
communicate, because it&rsquo;s always at a table in a room and it&rsquo;s
just... That wasn&rsquo;t my function, to get to know everyone
intimately, you know.
<br><br>

KC:
Right.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
But, it was similar to what you [Alfred] were talking about, liaison
and things like that.
<br><br>

BR:  But,
the table you&rsquo;re talking about is a table surrounded by humans
not from this planet, right?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Yeah. Well, they look like humans in general. Yes. Uh huh.
<br><br>

KC:  And
this took place at times also on Mars, right?
<br><br>

HD/A:
That&rsquo;s where they all took place for me. For me.
<br><br>

KC:  Did
you ever meet with these people here? Because as Bob was saying, he
met with, a scientist was...
<br><br>

HD/AN:
No. Not here.

<br><br>

KC:  I
see.
<br><br>

BR:  I
just wanted to jump in before the end of the tape to say that we...
<br><br>

HD/AN:
I&rsquo;m sorry. I made a mistake. Did I ever meet with them when I
was not working? Yes. But that&rsquo;s another story, a long time
ago.
<br><br>

BR:
That&rsquo;s another interesting story.
<br><br>

KC:  Oh,
right. Okay.
<br><br>

BR:  I
just want to say on record that the person who Alfred Webre is
talking about is Andy Basiago. We&rsquo;ve been in touch with him for
18 months. We haven&rsquo;t met him personally, but I personally
spoke with him 18 months ago for four hours continuously, which is
one of the more extraordinary conversations I&rsquo;ve had in my
life. I&rsquo;ve had quite a lot of extraordinary conversations now.
<br><br>

KC:  And I
lasted about two hours. I couldn&rsquo;t last the whole time, to be
honest.
<br><br>

BR:  And
as far as we are able to determine, and I&rsquo;m just speaking
epistemologically here, we fully support Andy&rsquo;s story and we
fully support his own intention to release his story to the world.
He&rsquo;s only told a tiny part of it so far.

<br><br>

What&rsquo;s
really interesting here is that this dovetails fully with Arthur&rsquo;s
personal experiences to do with time travel, to do with wormholes, to
do with the relationship with activity on Mars, and a whole
complexity here that&rsquo;s very hard to swallow, but it&rsquo;s
extremely important to understand.

<br><br>

I just
wanted to add our own support to that. This is something else that
we&rsquo;ll pick up and roll with later, because it&rsquo;s way
beyond the scope of this conversation.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay,
but I had a conversation today with one of our whistleblowers and he
actually was talking about the amount of radiation on Mars and
questioning...
<br><br>

BR:  No,
he wasn&rsquo;t. He was talking about the radiation in the Van Allen
Belts.
<br><br>

KC:  No,
he actually also talked about the radiation on Mars and I was asking
him about that and I said that the bases were underground. Is there
radiation on Mars in excess of what we have, for example, here on
Earth?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Because of what I was doing there, I wasn&rsquo;t even focused on
thinking about those things. I simply was going there for an
hour&mdash;[laughs] it sounds strange&mdash;for an hour meeting and
then I&rsquo;d leave and come here. And so for me, because of the way
my life&rsquo;s been like this for forever you know, nothing was
unusual. I didn&rsquo;t even think about things like that, whether
there was radiation or not. Those things were just handled by the way
the system was set up there, or is set up, or will be set up. I don&rsquo;t
even know what time period it is now. That&rsquo;s another subject.

<br><br>

KC:  Well
you had physiological reaction to having gone through that process.
Is that right?
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Right. Yeah. That&rsquo;s another thing, because of the kind of like
jetlag kind of thing. There is medicine that I was taking that, when
I quit, I actually forgot about, because everything happened so
suddenly when I quit that it was not available any longer. But that&rsquo;s
another subject again.
<br><br>

BR:  Well
it&rsquo;s tough to be, yeah... earlier, at the start of this
conversation, Arthur made a joke and said that he ran away. This is
not true, and I didn&rsquo;t want that to be misunderstood. It was
after a disagreement at work; you basically handed in your notice.
<br><br>

HD/A:  It
was kind of... it was not even a disagreement, it was...
<br><br>

BR:  It
was a conflict.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Mm... It was just&hellip; I got very tired, because things were
becoming more and more restricted in my life, to the point of where I
could no longer even call my friends or email my friends, and instead
of just trying to sit it out and go through all the massive paperwork
and things, and waiting, I just decided, you know, I would make the
decision instead.
<br><br>

BR:  So,
basically, it was a relatively sudden departure.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Very sudden.
<br><br>

BR:
Rather than being gradually rooted out, and that involved your
suddenly not taking any more of a particular medication.
<br><br>

HD/AN:
Which I forgot about because I just... I literally left everything
behind in my home and just went to another country.
<br><br>

BR:  Yes.
What I&rsquo;m stating here is that the medication you took was
something called &lsquo;Lorenzil&rsquo; [Ed
note: Could not clarify this word ... Lorenzo&rsquo;s Oil? Used in
treating certain neuropathies. Lorenzol? Used in veterinary
medicine.] which if you suddenly withdraw from that... Sorry.
That the effects that the Lorenzil is
designed to ameliorate is something that&rsquo;s called
<I>transdimensional disorder</I>.
<br><br>

HD/A:
Well, this is something that I understand from someone else that I
didn&rsquo;t know about.
<br><br>

BR:  Okay.
This is another thing that&rsquo;s beyond the scope of this
conversation. It&rsquo;s got to do with a zero time reference that
Peter Moon talked about in his first <I>Montauk</I> books and so on
and so forth.

For the
body it&rsquo;s very disorienting when it&rsquo;s going through jump
gates, or jump rooms, or whatever it is you want to call these
things. There&rsquo;s a certain medication that one has to take in
order to ameliorate that. If you suddenly withdraw from that, then
you&rsquo;re in big trouble, and this is one of the things that you
are up against.
<br><br>

KC:
Right. And I think that, at another point, we can talk in more depth
about that. But, for the purposes of this conversation, we&rsquo;re
really talking about the future of humanity and our interaction with,
well, certainly Anunnaki on Mars.

<br><br>

But, we
have a statement that was made, which was actually said to us by
Robert Dean and also some other whistleblowers, that the Anunnaki are
running things from behind the scenes here on Earth. And I wonder if
you, Alfred, would address that at all.
<br><br>

BR:  Or
try to.
<br><br>

AW:
Right. Well certainly I&rsquo;ve heard that there are various... That
is, to take a model of how decisions are made here on Earth, there
are various models which have some evidence for them.

<br><br>

One model
is a more drastic model than the Anunnaki model. That
involves&mdash;whether or not this is a true model or is the model
based on disinformation&mdash;involves the existence of a reptilian
race in the fourth density, that is one more density up from us. They
have more control over time, and that density has been behind the
phenomenon of alien abductions.

<br><br>

Now, there
are researchers, like Dr. Steven Greer, who believe that all
abductions... the Roper Poll shows that about two percent of the US
population, or about 6 million people, have been abducted, which is a
substantial number of people.

<br><br>

And there
are researchers, like Dr. Steven Greer, who believe that all of the
abductions are psy-ops, and are essentially done by elements of the
US government, as psychological warfare both against the human
population and against the ethical extraterrestrial population, to
stigmatize them.

<br><br>

Whether or
not that&rsquo;s true or not, there is certainly evidence that both
small Gray-looking beings and reptilian beings have been engaged in
extraterrestrial abductions of a substantial number of people, with a
high strangeness theme. And these have
been with secret contracts.
<br><br>

KC:  But
the fourth-dimensional aspect, which is the interdimensional quality
of this interaction and the fact of these beings, is a little
different, I would say, than what we interact with in terms of the
Anunnaki&mdash;in theory anyway.
<br><br>

AW:  Yes.
Yeah, this is a different sort of interaction.
<br><br>

BR:  One
second. We&rsquo;ve got to stop. We&rsquo;ve got one minute.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
Then let&rsquo;s do some sort of a summation and I&rsquo;d like you
[Alfred] to handle that, if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind.
<br><br>

AW:  Okay.
Well, first of all I think that we&rsquo;ve established that the
release of secrecy, we know empirically from yesterday, is a great
consciousness-raising event and it will be the deconstruction of
secrecy, with these great cosmic cycles, that will mediate a positive
human future.
<br><br>

BR:
That&rsquo;s great.
<br><br>

HD/A:  A
natural, almost natural event.
<br><br>

AW:  Yeah.
<br><br>

BR:
Arthur, Alfred, thank you so much for spending so much of your time
with us. We&rsquo;ll continue this conversation later. And we have to
come to an end here because we&rsquo;ve got no more digits. And,
Kerry, thank you too.
<br><br>

KC:
Absolutely. Thank you so much. This has been a fun, but enlightening
event we&rsquo;ve got going here, and we&rsquo;re going to continue
this conversation for years to come, I&rsquo;m sure.
