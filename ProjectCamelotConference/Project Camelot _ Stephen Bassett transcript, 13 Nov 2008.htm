And I&rsquo;m                  here with Bill Ryan from Project Camelot, and Stephen Bassett                  from Paradigm Research Group. And Stephen, we&rsquo;re here                  to talk to you about <em>Disclosure</em>. We&rsquo;re here                in Sedona. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous day. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we                    want to ask you some questions and go over the Disclosure                  process that you think is gonna happen; and at the same time                  give you some feedback from what we&rsquo;re getting from our                  witnesses, whistleblowers, and the like. And talk about that                  some.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stephen                Bassett (S):&nbsp; Sure. Let&rsquo;s do that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan                    (B):&nbsp; The elevator-speech opportunity is to                  explain in two sentences why you think Barack Obama will be                  the &ldquo;Disclosure President.&rdquo;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s that simple: When the music stopped,                  he got the last chair. All right? That&rsquo;s one reason. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the                    other reason is, there&rsquo;s pretty good evidence                  that the Democrats at the &ldquo;think-level&rdquo;, at the                  behind-the-scenes level you don&rsquo;t really see -- not out                  of the political front stuff -- that they, prompted, I think,                  by the Rockefeller initiative that was launched at the Clinton                  administration in &rsquo;93, started the wheels going deep                  in the party to work it out so they would be the &ldquo;Disclosure                  party&rdquo;. Meaning they would be the administration in power                  when Disclosure takes place. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They weren&rsquo;t able to do it under Clinton, for a host                  of reasons. But after two Bush terms, they have won. They&rsquo;re                  in. And there&rsquo;s evidence they&rsquo;ve been preparing                  for that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I think                    one of the things that they&rsquo;re gonna do                  -- and there&rsquo;s a lot of things they&rsquo;re gonna do.                  This is gonna be a major administration, for better or for                  worse. Big stuff -- is they&rsquo;re gonna <em>Disclose</em> early                  in the spring of 2009. And so that&rsquo;s why Barack will                  be the &ldquo;Disclosure President&rdquo;.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Are                    you getting this from insiders?

That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s <em>Disclosure</em>.

No. They&rsquo;re not going to be                  comfortable. But I&rsquo;m sure that Donald Rumsfeld wasn&rsquo;t                  very comfortable in any of the press conferences he gave.

I think something like 14% in one poll                  said: <em>I&rsquo;ve actually seen an alien. </em>Or:<em> I&rsquo;ve                  been in contact</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exopolitical                    sites are opening up in multiple countries.

Documents are being                  dumped out of the UK, France. Brazil is cooperating with UFO                  researchers.

Bill Clinton was approached by a couple                  of people, including&hellip; Paul Davids was interested in                  his response. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the                    kind of discussion you&rsquo;re talking about? No.                  We were ghettoized. The entire UFO and activist field was ghettoized                  early, in the late &rsquo;50s. We&rsquo;re still in the ghetto.                  The mainstream&rsquo;s trying to work this out. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They&rsquo;re not gonna climb in the ghetto with us to settle                  the issue. They&rsquo;re gonna settle it on their terms. The                  only question is whether the ghetto walls will come down, and                  we&rsquo;ll all be able to join in, you see. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, you                    know, we are missing some credentials.

But the question here that I have is, behind                  the scenes you&rsquo;ve got ETs that look human that may be                  walking around the Pentagon, as, according to some of our witnesses                  like Robert Dean, you know, and others. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; Sure.                Yeah. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So you&rsquo;ve got people in there that look human                  that are ET. You&rsquo;ve got ETS that don&rsquo;t look human                  that are involved, and they may not actually be friends with                  each other. So you&rsquo;ve got a more complex scenario behind                  the scenes going on while Disclosure is theoretically happening.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; Maybe.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And we&rsquo;re                  talking about the halls of the White House.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s cut to the chase here. I&rsquo;ve                    been approached by <em>lots</em> of people in the last 12                    years&hellip; all                  right?... with a <em>vast</em> array of theories. All right?                  As you have. And they&rsquo;re all very interesting and every                  one of them has potential impact on the process of Disclosure/                  exopolitics/ a post-Disclosure world. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the                    fact is, unlike the extraterrestrial presence, which has                    been researched and developed to the point of absolute certainty                    there is an extraterrestrial presence -- the fact that the                    government is covering it up is an absolute certainty. All                    right? Once you get past that&hellip; OK?... the certainty                  level drops off real fast. And when you get into this larger                  spectrum of theories, the fact is, we simply don&rsquo;t know.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; What you&rsquo;re saying is, the core story is the                  only thing that you&rsquo;re concerned with.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; I                    mean, there may be extraterrestrials among us, or there may                  not be. They may be in the Pentagon and they may not be. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so,                    given that, there&rsquo;s only one appropriate course                  of action -- and that&rsquo;s to take all of that, put it over                  to the side for review and consideration at any given time                  at your leisure, and focus on the fundamentals -- fundamental                  truths that you know are solid, that will hold up in a court                  of law, primo; and pursue that course. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because nobody has either the wisdom, the money, or the time,                  to even remotely attempt to incorporate the potential validities                  of scores of complex controversial theories into the larger                  picture. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It can&rsquo;t                    be done. We must, as Clint Eastwood said in <em>Magnum                    Force,</em> know our limitations. And so, as an activist,                    I keep focused and I let history and time sort a lot out.                    Because to try to do more would be to fail the fundamental                    purpose. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe                    that one of the reasons the truth embargo was able to be                    maintained &ndash; no disrespect, now -- is that it was                  extremely easy to keep researchers for the last 60 years, going                  all the way back to the &rsquo;40s, chasing their tails day                  after day after day. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s not right! If they did that to physics&hellip; Let&rsquo;s                  feed the physics committee with all kinds of interesting but                  not really valid theories so that all the physicists are chasing                  all kinds of stuff&hellip; So we can slow physics down, you                  see. That would be pretty damn cruel, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Well,                  that&rsquo;s exactly what they did with all of us. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. But what about the idea that Truman put together                  a band of people that are known as MJ-12? And we actually know                  a producer that&rsquo;s actually doing a history on that, that&rsquo;s                  sold to ABC, and will possibly be on television in the not                  too distant future.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; MJ-12                    has got a lot of substance behind it. And if somebody said: <em>What to you feel about the theory of MJ-12?</em> I&rsquo;d                  say I have high confidence.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. But what I&rsquo;m saying here is, those theories                  that you said are &ldquo;over here&rdquo; and we can&rsquo;t                  deal with them? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; You                can&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; They will know because they&rsquo;ve                    been assigned that task. They will, theoretically, know the                  answers to those theories.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; Who? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That                MJ-12 group.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s post-Disclosure. You see, post-Disclosure&hellip; As                  soon as things grow appropriate, and as they start revealing                  information, they will start assigning people as&hellip; and                  departments, and things&hellip; to go-to places, because not                  everybody wants to know everything. Certain deep researchers                  want to know certain things and others could care less. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. We&rsquo;ve                got to rap this up.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll start to get a bigger picture told                  to us. We&rsquo;ll start to be able to sort, but that sorting                  process ain&rsquo;t gonna happen till post-Disclosure. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; It will be a lot of easier. In other words, post-Disclosure                  could be done for a few mil. Pre-Disclosure, we&rsquo;re gonna                  need billions. It&rsquo;s not worth it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I like                    the fact that this information comes forward. I like the                    fact that we&rsquo;re engaged. I like the fact that                  something is bubbling. But we must maintain focus and we must                  understand our limitations and realize there&rsquo;s only so                  much we can do. We can&rsquo;t prove everything, you know.                  Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David Icke is an example of somebody who set himself a Herculean                  task of literally trying to figure it all out before any government                  would cooperate. Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K and B:&nbsp; Mm                hm.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; Boy, that ain&rsquo;t a job I would want to take                  on. Right? But he gave it a hell of a run. And undoubtedly                  a lot of what he found out will be proven true. And some of                  it won&rsquo;t be. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I describe                    it&hellip; Look. It&rsquo;s like the Women&rsquo;s                  Suffragette Movement. The point of the Women&rsquo;s Suffragette                  Movement was to get the right to vote for women. It wasn&rsquo;t                  to somehow figure out and sort out every concern that women                  have in the modern world and figure out how to make it right                  and bring them into a proper&hellip; and solve&hellip; No,                  it was to get the right to vote, hoping that once they had                  the right to vote that they would be able to assert their own                  influence and start to correct the issues and deal with problems. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All activism                    is that way. You know, Gandhi&lsquo;s job wasn&rsquo;t                  to solve all of India&rsquo;s problems or build a whole new                  state. It was just to get the British out. Get the British                  out and then we&rsquo;ll see how things go.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So what you&rsquo;re saying is that you have a focus,                  you&rsquo;re carrying out a mission, and actually your mission                  is very close to realization. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">S:&nbsp; Exactly. We are practically at the finish line, as                  it turns out. That&lsquo;s why we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of                  motion; we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of action; we&rsquo;re seeing                  a lot of press and media; people are getting a little worked                  up. Understandable. All right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s like all those football players -- they cross the                  goal line, they start doing all those dances and stuff. They                  even start dancing before they get to the goal line. So it&rsquo;s                  like that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;m                  optimistic, but there are no guarantees.
