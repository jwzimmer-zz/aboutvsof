It is                  incomplete at the beginning and at the end, but this                  middle section is so interesting that many may like to                  read it.

I know it&rsquo;s a broad question.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But                    I have to say&hellip; I mean, what we&lsquo;re                  getting is very similar to what you&rsquo;ve actually been                  talking about for the last 5-10 minutes. We are getting lots                  of cross-correlation, various whistleblowers in Black Ops,                  and also what you might term intuitives, and people coming                  forward from actual on-the-scene places, reporting about what&rsquo;s                  going on with the economy. Certainly we&rsquo;ve been in contact                  with Ben Fulford, that there was some kind of effort with the                  Japanese to bail out the US economy. Apparently that&rsquo;s                  being rejected.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; The                    Japanese were going to buy out a large chunk of some of these                  banks, Lehman and other ones.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. And we do understand the whole&hellip; that,                  you know, it&rsquo;s like a paper tiger. It&rsquo;s just crashing                  down.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well                    yes. It&rsquo;s                all by design though.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. We understand that this is the Illuminati                  agenda. And we also understand that behind the Illuminati you&rsquo;ve                  got, you know, a certain faction of the Anunnaki. So it goes                  way, way back.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; Yes. One of the analogies, Bill, that I                  use when I&rsquo;m talking to people is the metaphor that you                  described in your Granada Forum lecture, that it&rsquo;s like                  they&rsquo;ve just piled up all the ingredients for a fire,                  with a little tender and the kindling and the big logs and                  the large logs, and all it needs is a match. And now I think                  they&rsquo;re just about to strike the match.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Oh yeah. They are. In fact, it won&rsquo;t                    take very much. It could be economic collapse and they could                  declare martial law.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yeah.                We get that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve                    got around 8 billion out there under active handlers and                  of those 780,000 are actually for execution.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; We                    suspect that there may be several events coming up in quick                  succession in the next three or four weeks.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah,                    they could happen. Several things are going to be intervening                  here. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People                    need to realize that we&rsquo;re not dealing with...                  This is something that&rsquo;s really shocking for a lot of                  people that think the New World Order&rsquo;s run by a bunch                  of rich, inbred white guys from Europe. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;re                    dealing with <em>transdimensional entities</em> and                  beings from other worlds that even transcend the idea of the                  Anunnaki. They have to understand that there&rsquo;s a galactic                  order and a cosmic order to things... of higher order beings                  that have been watching our world, certainly very aghast with                  the battlefield that&rsquo;s been going on in the psychic level,                  the physical level, the informational level, etc. It&rsquo;s                  been on every possible level you can imagine. And we&rsquo;re                  caught in the clutches, literally, of being on the battle line                  of a great galactic and cosmic war. Literally <em>Star Wars</em>.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes.                We would agree with that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; That star-war has been going on for ages, with previous                  collapses of our civilization caused by these same creatures.                  What&rsquo;s happening now, though, is that human beings are                  getting to the point where we&rsquo;re almost ready to be <em>birthed</em> or                  be <em>annihilated</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>And the decision is going to require a sea-change in the                    attitude of people,</em> not the technology, to get us through                    this, but an attitude change in terms of the core connectedness                    of people to their Higher-order Self, if you want to call                    it, understanding the nature of what they <em>are</em> as                    a being, and the nature of the universe.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes. That&rsquo;s                absolutely right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And religions, which I call &ldquo;real lies going                  on&rdquo;&hellip; because the problem is, religions are a substitute                  for knowledge and wisdom of what&rsquo;s really the nature                  of themselves and the nature of their universe.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes. We wouldn&rsquo;t argue with any of that. Basically                  we understand the underlying spiritual basis for what&lsquo;s                  going on.

And there&rsquo;s a photon                  jet that comes out of that that actually drives nuclear reactions                  in all the stars in the galaxy and creates the vortex -- the                  time/space vortex -- that actually creates the <em>spin</em> of                  the galaxy. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, that                    interlocked magnetic flux lines of the suns interlocks with                    all the plasma fields underneath all the planets and stars,                  so that there&rsquo;s an interlocking there. And there&rsquo;s                  also an interlocking with our bodies&rsquo; cells, called the <em>Lamar                  Effect</em>, where the valence electrons are bumped out to                  the outer orbitals, to cause chemical reactions. So if you                  don&rsquo;t have a magnetic flux field, your chemical reactions                  turn off and you die. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we&rsquo;re all interlocked, in other words. The symbol                  for the super black hole at the center of each galaxy that                  creates this vortex field that&rsquo;s connected across an                  umbilicus to a parallel universe. And the symbol for that is                  the <em>swastika</em>, the oldest symbol found in the temple                  at Delhi, India, over 5500 years ago. So they&rsquo;re quite                  aware of it. That&rsquo;s why they had the Society of the Black                  Sun in Germany because they understood that this knowledge                  was passed down through&hellip; from the sacred libraries collected                  in most recent times by the Romans. But it ended up in the                  Vatican Library.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes. Just to continue, though, this guy referenced                  the event of 1859 that you&rsquo;ll probably know about as                  something to help us understand what kind of event a mass ejection                  is.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; 1859&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; There was a huge solar storm. At that time, of course,                  it didn&rsquo;t affect any electronics or anything, but they                  had auroral displays as far south or as far north as the Equator. <br>                <br>                BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; And                    there was a big fireworks display and everyone just kind                    of watched it all. But nothing was taken down. And, of course,                  nowadays it would be a totally different story. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And for                    some reason that we don&lsquo;t understand, this guy                  who contacted us a couple of years ago said that this thing                  would be coming up for us around about 2009. He did not explain                  how he knew this was coming. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second thing he said was that there was going to be a <em>magnetic                    pole reversal</em>. His exact words, just to support what                    you&rsquo;re saying there.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yes, that&rsquo;s already happening. We&rsquo;re                  having a collapse of the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic                  in the areas of the Arctic and the Antarctic. That&rsquo;s                  already happening now.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; And the last thing he said, and this was two years                  ago, and this may have been mitigated, (and this is a longer                  conversation that we&rsquo;d like to talk with you about),                  he said there would be a pole shift, a physical pole shift.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; So you&rsquo;re                talking about a physical pole shift. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; This is what he&rsquo;s                saying.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yes. In other words, you&rsquo;re                    talking about a precession of the spin of the Earth that                  causes the actual continents to drift.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; What he said was a pole shift. Now, there&rsquo;s                  complicated information here that we can -- this is probably                  beyond the scope of this phone call, which we can talk about                  when we meet &ndash; but there&rsquo;s a possibility that that&rsquo;s                  been mitigated. In other words, it won&rsquo;t happen. But                  even without that we&rsquo;re in trouble enough. So it&rsquo;s                  kind of like we&rsquo;ve got a lot on our plates right now.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well, at the very least, even if they mitigated,                  the main problem that&rsquo;s going to happen is major climatic                  changes and famine. The most thorough way to do that is a pandemic,                  even more thorough than a nuclear war, because within two weeks                  of a nuclear war the radiation levels are low enough for troops                  and people to move around even without rad suits. So a pandemic                  is much more serious than that in terms of stopping services                  and so on.&nbsp; Because once the dust is clear, if you&rsquo;ve                  got limited destruction you can find routes of transport and                  most of the ground level radiation is low enough people can                  walk around because most of the radioisotopes have dissipated.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. Well, we&rsquo;re                    getting also some information about this belt around the                  Equator, of&hellip; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; This is John Moore&rsquo;s information, which you                  may be familiar with. Because he says that he has talked to                  three independent submariners. And one of the words that he                  used was really quite compelling to me. He said that if you&rsquo;re                  in a submarine, knowing where the bottom of the ocean is and                  knowing where the surface of the ocean is is mandatory. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; He&rsquo;s referring to a classified US Navy map                  showing drastically altered coastlines. Now you may be familiar                  with this. And the question that we&rsquo;ve always had about                  this is: <em>Well, where does this water come from?</em> And                  John Moore says that&hellip; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Actually&hellip; Look, we really need to understand the physics                  of this, because, due to the spin of the Earth, you&rsquo;ve                  got&hellip; Actually sea level at the Equator is much further                  away from the center of the Earth than it is any other place                  because you&rsquo;ve got centrifugal force. It&rsquo;s about                  400 feet higher at the Equator.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; And                    so what we need to do is to change the <em>axis</em> of                  rotation of the Earth in some way and then all of that water                  readjusts itself. And when it readjusts itself you&rsquo;re                  talking about huge impacts on coastlines.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Oh,                    yes. In other words, what you&rsquo;re saying                  is there&rsquo;s change in the bulge of the Earth to a different                  band.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Exactly. That&rsquo;s                    right. And if the liquid bulge of the Earth moves, then that                    impacts billions of people everywhere. And this is just one                    of the physical knock-on effects of some kind of alteration                  in the way that the Earth is spinning.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well, one of the things that people need to know                  -- and I&rsquo;m going to have Robert Felix back on; I&rsquo;ve                  been investigating this for about 5, 6 years -- is that as                  we enter this energetic part of the galaxy, there&rsquo;s a                  lot of cosmic rays and other things that act as micronuclei                  to trigger increased rainfall. And the thing that precipitates&hellip; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of                    the most serious effects of climate change is actually not                    global warming, it&rsquo;s increased rainfall caused by                  cosmic particles that act as micronuclei. And the rainfall                  increase is the thing that drives us into an ice age. And it&rsquo;s                  very probable that, as we head into this photon belt, that                  it&rsquo;s going to trigger another ice age, because we&rsquo;re                  in an interglacial period. And it doesn&rsquo;t take 10 years                  to happen. It can happen literally in one year.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes. That&rsquo;s                right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s very probable that what will be triggered                  as we pass through this, even if we only have a magnetic pole                  shift and we survive that, is it&rsquo;ll precipitate a glacial                  ice sheet mass of snowfall. The amount of rain that has been                  occurring in Canada and across north Europe and the northern                  States is absolutely phenomenal. If that continues through                  this winter, they may very well have snow in the northern latitudes                  that may not be gone by next summer.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; We                    heard that there were some ice sheets in the Rockies that                    were previously just seasonal and which are now becoming                  permanent.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. Now what&rsquo;s happening&hellip; And a                  lot of the Global Warming people try to say they&rsquo;re seeing                  the polar ice sheet melting in the Arctic, but that&rsquo;s                  because they&rsquo;re directly over the Gakkel Range which                  is a 1500 km range of volcanic mountains and the water&rsquo;s                  coming out at 700 degrees. So it&rsquo;s melting from <em>below</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    what&rsquo;s going on in Antarctica&hellip; and nine                  out of ten glaciers are actually <em>increasing</em> in thickness.                  So what we&rsquo;re heading into, I believe, is an ice age. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The melting                    of the Arctic is all caused by under-oceanic currents caused                    by volcanism.
