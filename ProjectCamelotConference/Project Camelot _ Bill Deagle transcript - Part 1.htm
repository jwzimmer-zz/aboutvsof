And one of the things which                  we hope to do in the next couple of hours is to see whether                  we can get on record as much of the remaining 90% as possible.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; [laughs]</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; And                    in particular, many of the people viewing this video now,                    and the two of us, Kerry, and myself in particular, are really                    interested and focused on what is going to be happening in                  the immediate few weeks and months. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And                  I think one of the phrases that Bill used was &ldquo;the                  calm before the storm&rdquo;.<br>                  <br>                  What&rsquo;s the storm?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well,                    the best way to think is the Emory War College. And if you                    talk to people that work in the Marine-Army War College and                    other places, what they do is, they war-game it out. They                    have people that sit around big boardroom tables, and then                  what they do is, they put it into simulation computers. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They use Simula PL/1 and other languages that were actually                  developed for the military, and then they put it on their own                  super-computers and then they run through a number of simulations.                  So every war, every conflict, every national emergency, has                  already been scenarioed out. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People                    don&rsquo;t realize just how much computing power has                  been put into these things -- for everything from ET invasions,                  to a tsunami hitting the west coast, to Cumbre Viejo <em>[Ed.                  Note: an island in the Canaries that could collapse and cause                  a tsunami on the East coast of the US]</em>, to a civil disruption                  because of an earthquake in the New Madrid fault in the Midwest.                  So basically everything&rsquo;s been simulated. There&rsquo;s                  a number of items. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, what                    I often try to do on my radio show, which is the Nutrimedical                    Report; it&rsquo;s on Genesis Network. And the                  two websites, if you want to check it out, are <a href="https://nutrimedical.com" target="_blank">nutrimedical.com</a>,                  where I have a lot of the anti-aging, life extension, civil                  defense, and other information. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the                    other website is <a href="https://clayandiron.com" target="_blank">clayandiron.com</a>. The network is Genesis                    Network. It&rsquo;s out of St. Paul, Minnesota. And their                    website for getting podcasts, streaming and on-demand, which                  replays the shows, is <a href="https://gcnlive.com" target="_blank">gcnlive.com</a>.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What I                    try to do on my show is... I realize that one                  of the things about having a regular radio show is you can                  bring in all of these experts and guests, but there are several                  ways of approaching it. My approach has been to try... if                  they listen to enough shows, that people will start to see                  a montage of images that&rsquo;ll change their paradigm.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because                    you can&rsquo;t change people by necessarily beating                  them over the head with the facts if they emotionally aren&rsquo;t                  ready for that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And you also have to change their paradigm by what                  I call the &ldquo;little grades&rdquo; that happen as they                  listen to more and more people, and they are willing to accept                  one message from one type of person, or one way of doing it,                  or a little humor, or some music.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And eventually they get to the point where they&rsquo;re                  able to then accept the intellectual truths, the spiritual                  truths, and so on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two                    key things that I try to teach on my show are: The first                    thing is that people don&rsquo;t know what they are.                  People really don&rsquo;t know what kind of a <em>being</em> they                  are, and because of that -- which is in many cases kept purposely                  away from them &ndash; they&rsquo;re manipulated. For example,                  if you didn&rsquo;t know you were a bird, you&rsquo;d obviously                  not try to fly. Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yep.                Good analogy.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD: &nbsp;The other thing I try to teach them is that everything                  that they have learned in the past has been predigested and                  presented to them so they really don&rsquo;t understand the                  nature of the universe they live in. They don&rsquo;t even                  know what &ldquo;reality&rdquo; is.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yeah. And all this is one of the parameters in the                  model, presumably, that people are interacting with this &ldquo;stage                  show&rdquo;... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; ...with                    a very limited amount of information at their disposal with                  which to react, to make appropriate judgments. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. So what I try to do is, I try to stretch                  them beyond that. One of the things that I try to do is... There&rsquo;s                  no such thing as a &ldquo;sacred cow,&rdquo; whether it&rsquo;s                  a political view, a religious view, a scientific view. It has                  to be, you know, &ldquo;trust but verify&rdquo;.

You have what I call &ldquo;the                  two witnesses&rdquo;. It has to not assault your intellect                  (the information), and it also has to ring with your spirit.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Good.                    But, you know, a lot of people watching this now have already                  done that homework... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; ...either by listening to your shows or listening                  to ours, because we&rsquo;ve been operating in essentially                  the same way.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Or                both. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s also...

And there&rsquo;s                  a number of what I call &ldquo;spasms of events&rdquo; that&rsquo;re                  going to happen. And to just give you the timeline of where                  things are going rather than giving you specific dates... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first thing is that people need to understand, whether                  we elect McCain/Palin or Obama/Biden, or the Green Party with                  McKinney, the events are already in motion to create a regional                  and world economic catastrophe and then to create regional                  and world banks. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; So they&rsquo;ve already got the script for the                  movie, but they haven&rsquo;t got the cast yet.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. They&rsquo;ve gone to central casting, and                  whoever the players are, they&rsquo;re in a sense going to                  be like riders on the wave of this.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; OK. So what&rsquo;s                the script? [laughs]</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well, the script basically is&nbsp;that... And                  I&rsquo;ll back up a little bit, so that...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yeah.                    And also a few minutes ago you mentioned modeling. It would                    be great to tie this back into the modeling scenario that                  you mentioned.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. They&rsquo;ve done lots of modeling. In fact                  they have one of the most advanced programs at the University                  of California in San Francisco. And they&rsquo;re tied directly                  into the National Reconnaissance Office. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This, by the way, I do regularly on my show -- release classified                  information.

It&rsquo;s                  actually Shriver Air Force Base. But they also have their systems                  elsewhere. And people need to know that the world that they                  believe in is a fairytale that never existed. Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; So anyway, this is at university level. They have                  a social modeling super-computer program. And what they do                  is, they try different perturbations. They&rsquo;ll try a little                  thing, put a balloon up, put a media event. And they&rsquo;re                  able to model that based on getting information back. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They&rsquo;re able to do specific searches, which are called &ldquo;architectural                  searches,&rdquo; not all that different from the <a href="https://halfpasthuman.com" target="_blank">Half                  Past Human</a> or the Princeton University kind of &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; thing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They&rsquo;re actually mining the Internet; they&rsquo;re                  mining phone conversations.

But the most important is they just know                  what they&rsquo;re viewing. And if they know what they&rsquo;re                  viewing, what the box is turned on to, they can actually put                  this back into their data.

And they try to see what kind of                    response they&rsquo;re getting from the public.

Just                  to give you an idea: The first thing is, you have to look at                  the menu of what they have.

Like, a lot of people say: <em>Well,</em> <em>why                  hasn&rsquo;t there been another 9/11?</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Mm                hm.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right? Another... like blowing up cities or                  doing other things? Because for years they&rsquo;ve been doing                  war-game simulations of a 10-kiloton nuke in a number of cities. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example,                    this year it was in Portland Harbor, and last year it was                    in Charleston Harbor, where they actually did a simulation                  of a... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it was not just the U.S. It was the U.S., British, and                  Canadians, where they were doing a joint war-games simulation                  of this, and trying to see the civil defense, and the radiation                  plume, and the movement of the public and, you know, how to                  handle the bodies, and all this kind of stuff. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So they&rsquo;re                    doing all of that. They do this on multiple levels and they                    feed the data back into their super-computers to decide what                  will work best. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of                    the things that we did... Back in the late 90s,                  I was a doctor for Rocky Mountain Occupational Medicine, and                  we got the contract for the Hazmat teams in Colorado, for the                  FBI and the Centers for Disease Control to do a war-game simulation                  called Operation Top Off and Operation Dark Winter. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We did                    a simulation at the Performing Arts Center, on a &ldquo;simulated                  release&rdquo;, not a real release, of pneumonic plague. And                  we wanted to look at the kill ratio, in terms of how quickly                  the system could be activated -- the EMS system -- to be able                  to get people and treat them and triage them and whatever. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we                    did a similar one down on 17th Avenue, downtown Denver, in                    a second-floor window of an apartment. And we even set up                  a sprayer to spray out the window, with a little compressed                  air, a little vapor stream, which was supposedly anthrax. So,                  it would be a weaponized anthrax stream that would actually                  spray out that second-floor window. And that anthrax stream                  would then... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We would                    then have people go... We had the Hazmat officers                  and Special Forces, and they would go to various hospitals,                  like St. Joe&rsquo;s, Presbyterian, St. Lukes, etcetera. And                  we tried to see, with recording all these data intake sheets,                  whether or not, Number One, emergency departments would activate                  CDC, get the proper specimens, get the people treated in a                  timely fashion so they wouldn&rsquo;t die. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We killed everybody.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Why                did you kill everybody, though?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; We killed everybody because the system was too inadequate.                  The Emergency department doctors, the infectious disease, the                  activation of the system...

The analogy I use on                  my show is... In their training in England, as part of                  a power game, they&rsquo;d bring you to their gardens. And                  their gardener would kind of make a little maze. And then you&rsquo;d                  go through the <em>little maze</em> and thought you were quite                  clever because you&rsquo;d get out in a matter of moments. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then                    what they&rsquo;d do is, they&rsquo;d take you to                  the <em>big maze</em>, which was done by a very clever gardener.                  And the only way you could get out was if you were talked out.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; OK.

What we have to                  do is use a lot of discernment. There&rsquo;s basically two                  perspectives in the universe -- and this is whether you&rsquo;re                  human or nonhuman. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What we                    are or any other &ldquo;sentient&rdquo; being in the                  universe is a spirit-being that&rsquo;s transcending through                  an energy matrix, creating a reality. OK? In other words, we                  are co-creators of our own timeline and future. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Absolutely.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And                    if you look at people like Michio Kaku and advanced physicists                    and so on, they talk about the universe in terms of energy.                    You know, like a Zero Energy culture, and the Level One energy                    culture, a culture that is able to leap across the galaxy                  and is bound by time and space. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But you can also use those similar principles for, you know                  -- similar kinds of characteristics -- for dealing with what                  I call the spirituality of a sentient civilization.

And                    many times it&rsquo;s been converted, or perverted, or                  twisted. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or they                    themselves didn&rsquo;t have the whole truth, they                  just had portions of it, so then it became a &ldquo;religion.&rdquo; Now, <em>religion</em> is                  a substitute for <em>relationship</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yep.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And I call it &ldquo;real lies going on&rdquo;.                  And it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re talking about Buddhism,                  Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Atheism. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the &ldquo;isms&rdquo; in the world fall into two categories:                  Either you hear the Voice of the spirit that created you and                  created all that exists, the continuum -- because without a                  single voice there is no universe -- one &ldquo;I&rdquo; voice,                  I call it. There is no one &ldquo;I&rdquo; voice. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, therefore,                    it&rsquo;s either <em>your</em> will &ndash; the                  will of, in other words, deciding for yourself what is good                  or evil -- or hearing the Voice. In other words, you don&rsquo;t                  need to tell people what&rsquo;s right or wrong. If they&rsquo;re                  in contact with their higher self and with the Creator that                  created them, they know what&rsquo;s right or wrong. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; OK. Now, just bring that back to where you were                  when you were talking about the wild card factors of who people                  really are -- this is my paraphrase of what you were saying                  -- and how there are certain things that can&rsquo;t be programmed                  into their super-computer, because, actually, you&rsquo;re                  talking about actual human beings that are eternal and magical.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Exactly. And you see that point ties in with the                  factions, if you want to call it. You know, you can go to all                  kinds of different religious books, whether it&rsquo;s the                  Hopi Indians or the Christian Bible or many other books, and                  they&rsquo;ll tell you that there&rsquo;s been visitations                  to Earth over all of the ages.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; OK. Now...&nbsp;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And the way it ties into this is that some of these                  visitors have specific characteristics that are very common.                  For example, Naga, in the area of Oceania. Right? Which are,                  you know, the serpent people or the feathered serpent god,                  or whatever. What you&rsquo;ll find...&nbsp;Or the Dagon,                  which is, you know, the amphibian beings that come from a world.                  And therefore, even the hat, for example, that&rsquo;s on the                  Pope, is actually called &ldquo;the sign of Dagon&rdquo;, which                  is a fish-god or Oannes...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.                Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK. Right. But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp;&nbsp; ...which                  is always in the background, in other words.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Right                    now there will be people watching this who say: <em>I know                    I&rsquo;m eternal and magical, and I&rsquo;m                  really interested in what you&rsquo;re saying. So what can                  I do? How can I be? What action can I take to capitalize on                  my wild card so they may not be able to predict what I&rsquo;m                  going to do next?</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah, what I&rsquo;m trying to get at... You                  know, I hear lots of different reports, that people say: <em>I&rsquo;ve                  been in touch with the Pleiadians or Andromedans, or I&rsquo;m                  in touch with this group or that group.</em> But people need                  to use <em>extreme</em>, <em>extreme</em> discernment.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR: &nbsp;Yep.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And the way I think about it is this. Say, you know,                  if you went to a new city. Let&rsquo;s say you were from South                  Africa and you came to New York City, and you didn&rsquo;t                  know where to go, but you went to the wrong part of the city.                  You might not come back out alive. OK?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Right</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And a similar thing... You                  have to think of the universe that way, too.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yep.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; There&rsquo;s                  very good places in the universe, and very bad. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; OK? Just think of it this way. Any being that&rsquo;s                  capable of leaping across space/time and arriving in our world,                  you have to assume that their intelligence is limitlessly greater                  than ours. And therefore anything that they communicate to                  us could either be very true or very, very maliciously manipulated                  to control us, almost like a pack. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Exactly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; In other words, we would be treated like an ant,                  or cockroach or like my pet dogs. They would have no way of                  even understanding what we&rsquo;re talking about, so it would                  be almost sport. Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Except that, if they&rsquo;re that intelligent,                  they also realize that we&rsquo;re grand spiritual beings in                  our own right and therefore they&rsquo;re actually dealing                  with something that&rsquo;s much more massive than just our                  3-dimensional form.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Exactly, exactly. Here&rsquo;s the point, though.                  You&rsquo;ve got two perspectives out there. You&rsquo;ve got                  one group -- we&rsquo;ll call them, just for the sake of it,                  you know, like David Icke. He was speaking at the UFO Conference                  up in San Francisco. He calls them the Reptilians. OK? Or you                  might call them the serpents, like it talks about in the Bible.                  OK? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in                    fact, you&rsquo;ve got to understand that when you                  look at the Bible at things that are a description to people                  that were shepherds and artisans 2- to 3-thousand years ago.                  Right? Or you look at other ancient books... And what                  they&rsquo;re really trying to describe here is something that&rsquo;s                  actually quite similar to what&rsquo;s happening today. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So let&rsquo;s                    say we have one group that says: <em>We are                    a predatory super-nation of super-scientists that don&rsquo;t                    have any spirit, but we invade and take over worlds.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Hum.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; <em>We can invade the mind-space dimension. We can                    attack on the physical level. We can put policies in place                    to cut off the connection between their physical body and                    their spiritual body</em> -- through things like fluoridation                    and genetically modified food or electromagnetic pollution.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; So                    are you suggesting that it is the Reptilians that are involved                  with the current Illuminati?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well... Yeah,                yeah, yeah.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; This                type of agenda?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Of course. Yeah. It&rsquo;s just no different than                  what the Bible has been saying all along, -- &nbsp;the serpentine.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right. So I want to sort of base it here in the                  here-and-now a little bit so we can understand what you&rsquo;re                  talking about.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. A lot of times, though, they misjudge it.                  Because for example, when... David&rsquo;s done a lot                  of really good work. But one of the times... If you don&rsquo;t                  know what you&rsquo;re seeing because you&rsquo;ve never seen                  anything like it before... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What he                    did is, he took a thing called ayahuasca, which is an analog                    of dimethyltriptamine. And ayahuasca and dimethyltriptamine                  opens up what&rsquo;s called, you know, the spirit eye. People                  call it the third eye, the astral eye, or whatever. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But basically                    it is, we&rsquo;re all born as children with                  this ability to see in the spirit realm. And that&rsquo;s why                  children see their little friends, and see other things, and                  see good and bad. And they have a thing called <em>pavor nocturnus,</em> or                  night terrors, because they can see in the spirit realm things                  that aren&rsquo;t pleasant. They&rsquo;re very nasty. Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not just making it up in their little                  minds because they&rsquo;ve got hormone surges. They&rsquo;re                  actually having a problem. So the reason why I seem to be a                  little circuitous here is that people misinterpret the signals. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example,                    after David went and took ayahuasca down in South America,                    and he got into this altered state, he started seeing what                    he misinterpreted as shape-shifting.

And so many messages have                  a lot of noise in them that people won&rsquo;t get a clear                  understanding of either the opportunities or the dangers of                  what&rsquo;s going on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Sure.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And so you&rsquo;ll have people, for example, like                  Arizona Wilder and others, that say they&rsquo;ve seen these                  things happen right in the middle of ceremonies or whatever.                  And what they don&rsquo;t understand is that the intensity                  is so great, they&rsquo;re actually seeing into the spirit                  realm that&rsquo;s happening in a parallel universe.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Right.

But at the same time,                  let&rsquo;s talk about how does that impact the Illuminati                  agenda? Because we&rsquo;ve got a lot of Reptilians who&rsquo;re                  influencing that agenda.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well,                    let me explain what happens. If you look at all the secret                    societies down through history -- not just in our current                    history in the last 6,000 years, but basically pretty well                    all of human history, going back to previous civilizations                  that have risen and fallen -- there has been this, if you want                  to call it, <em>dark alliance</em>. OK? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the                    dark alliance has been, basically, with higher orders of                    these secret orders that it&rsquo;s passed down through.                  In the most recent past, going back the last 6,000 years, it                  was the ancient Sumerians and the Egyptians. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the highest rulers of those civilizations would put their                  children through sex-magic rituals, human sacrifice, and other                  things, so they would create, if you want to call it, an <em>astral                  gate</em> in their mind, so they could attach these transdimensional                  entities to them, almost like the sucker-fish on the shark.                  OK? And you could not advance within any of these higher orders                  unless you went through these ceremonies. So...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Svali                  talks about this, actually, and so does Leo Zagami. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. So what happens is, for example... If                  you&rsquo;re going to get to these higher orders within the                  Illuminati you actually have to go through these rituals in                  order for you and your... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The greatest                    power is for your ancestors to actually &ldquo;curse                  you&rdquo; to be attached by these things, to gain more physical,                  psychic, emotional and intellectual powers. So then, therefore,                  you can become a &ldquo;hu-man&rdquo; -- which, in Welsh, is <em>serpent                  man</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if                    you look at the Magna Carta, it was written not for the &ldquo;mansters&rdquo; --                    which is the word <em>manster</em>,                  which converted to <em>monster</em> -- it was for <em>serpent-man</em> or                  the Royals, those who had gone through the ceremonies, who                  were &ldquo;hu-mans&rdquo; which means serpent-men, and had                  the transdimensionals literally attached to them almost like                  a parasite, a psychic parasite, to create a &ldquo;hu-man&rdquo; which                  is a new, if you want to call it, hybrid. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clay and                    iron. In other words, you have the iron of the serpentine                  transdimensional beings with their higher science and abilities                  and so on, literally attached to the &ldquo;man&rdquo; to create                  a &ldquo;hu-man.&rdquo;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK. So basically you&rsquo;ve got Illuminati with                  this proclivity, whatever you want to call it. And then what                  happens? Because that&rsquo;s where we are now with society.                  These people have been leading the way -- if you want to call                  it &ldquo;leading&rdquo; -- down a dark corridor, so to speak.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; They consider themselves... You see, one of                  the problems is a matter of perception. If you feel in your                  own twisted way... You&rsquo;re deciding what is right                  or wrong, and you feel you have the right to decide, and you&rsquo;re                  the keeper of civilization. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example,                    if you look at the tunic on the Teutonic Knights.

That cross                  was long before Jesus Christ, long before there was the first                  Jew, long before Egypt and Sumeria.

So what you&rsquo;re doing is, you&rsquo;re looking at                  the swinging arms of a galaxy, above and below the equinoxes.                  That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re seeing there. OK?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; So here we are at this juncture.

And an equinox has very important effects, not just                  on the physical plane, because we&rsquo;re entering an energy                  belt which affects the DNA. It affects lifeforms, communications                  and everything. But it also affects the spiritual aspects of                  the creatures on the planet.

Number one: Am I involved with a <em>religion</em>, &ldquo;real                  lies going on&rdquo;, or am I involved with <em>spirituality</em>?                  And I&rsquo;m not necessarily going to put a label on it or                  tell &rsquo;em which one.&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; What I try to tell &rsquo;em is that... For                  example, I&rsquo;m a believer, but if I go to a church I&rsquo;m                  going to cause trouble, because I know things that they can&rsquo;t                  know, won&rsquo;t know, that are going to show that a lot of                  things that they&rsquo;re teaching are patently lies. OK?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Of                course.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And, unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t just one group                  or another. I&rsquo;m closest allied to, if you want to call                  it, I&rsquo;m like a cosmic messianic believer. And I don&rsquo;t                  even like to use the word <em>Christian</em>, because it was                  actually a blasphemy against Christians and their little anointed                  ones.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yeah.

Now, here&rsquo;s the point.                  If you actually understand the split in the so-called eastern                  and western church, you understand the reason why there&rsquo;s                  such a determination to not only hijack Judiasm, and Christianity                  and Islam, and why this is all kind of leading us toward what&rsquo;s                  called this final conflict of Armageddon. It&rsquo;s been stage-managed                  at a higher level. Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all staged-managed. And the problem is,                  people don&rsquo;t understand they&rsquo;re being manipulated,                  even though their every step is being manipulated. <em>Oh yeah,                  we&rsquo;ve got to get Al-Quaeda.</em> Well, you know, who                  created Al-Quaeda? When you start showing that these things                  were totally manufactured.

If somebody                  had told me this years ago, I&rsquo;d say: <em>You&rsquo;re                  crazy, there&rsquo;s no way.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, you                    know, going through medical school training, surgery, whatever,                    I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s no way that that could                  be true. Because my mind is now focused. I&rsquo;m going to                  be a doctor; I&rsquo;m going to help people; I&rsquo;m going                  to do this and that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;m getting access to the totality of human knowledge                  and science, and I&rsquo;m going to...

And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s disturbing about this,                  and I&rsquo;m trying to get the message to the people. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hardest is to argue with people. I remember having an                  argument a year and a half ago with Professor Steven Jones,                  who felt that thermate could have brought down the World Trade                  Centers alone. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, of                    course, until they&rsquo;ve had a background in quantum                  physics and nuclear physics -- I was supposed to go to MIT                  and I went into honors biochemistry -- I asked him a series                  of questions that he couldn&rsquo;t answer on a scientific                  ground. But he wanted to cling to his <em>a priori</em> idea                  anyway. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even though there is probably evidence it was thermate, there                  had to be nuclear explosions. There could have not been directed                  energy weapons. And I tried to explain to him. Because I was                  a doctor for US Space Command and Strategic Defense, Star Wars.                  And I said: <em>I&rsquo;ve talked to the engineers at very high                  levels, and I know exactly what&rsquo;s capable and what we                  have.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.                You have a really interesting background. OK?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; But                    a lot of people say: <em>Well, you&rsquo;re                    working for them.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah. I know they&rsquo;ll say that, but what people                  need to do is, they... Ultimately, they need to do is                  an intellectual analysis and they need to pray. They need to                  trust their gut, in other words, their spiritual gut.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; So                    how did you get out of it? Because in a sense you did work                  for them. Right? You were their doctor.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well, I was their doctor. But here&rsquo;s what                  happened. People are so compartmentalized. To give you an example:                  Initially I talked to someone working at, say Falcon. And they                  had a little badge that would allow them to go into one hallway,                  and down one pathway, into one room with a security card. And                  they&rsquo;d face-scan them with a retinal scan, and fingerprint                  scan them, and boom, they go in their room. And they&rsquo;d                  spend so many hours there and they&rsquo;d walk down the same                  pathway. And they were monitored all the way.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; They had to follow lines. Isn&rsquo;t                that right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; They had to follow certain lines on the floor, and                  if they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re immediately apprehended.                  And it&rsquo;s not pleasant. OK? So they&rsquo;re very highly                  compartmentalized. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So you                    can talk to your doctor. Now, these guys really loved being                    able to talk to me because what I would do is, I would talk                    to all the different people. And because I have this advanced                  technical training, which they never assumed I did -- like                  you know, artificial intelligence, super-computers, electronics,                  quantum physics, and other things --I&rsquo;d talk to them                  about their project. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And after                    while they were more interested in hearing what I had to                    tell them about what everybody else was doing and projects                    that they didn&rsquo;t know anything about. So as                  time went on I gained more and more knowledge.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yeah.                    And it continued training you what questions to ask and you                  knew how to listen.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. They wanted to talk because they couldn&rsquo;t                  tell their wives. They weren&rsquo;t allowed to tell anybody,                  their son, their wife, their children, anybody, or their next                  door neighbor.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; So you get this aggregate of information. And on                  top of it, you&rsquo;ve had these life-death experiences.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. And some, what I&rsquo;d                    call supernatural, and some other types of experiences that                  all fit together.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK. You&rsquo;re putting all of this together and                  then you eventually create this radio show. Right? And you&rsquo;re                  interviewing witnesses and so on. But where are you at now,                  as we take this whole package? And you&rsquo;ve got something                  to say here because you called us and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; And                I find this very interesting.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well                actually, I was told to call you.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; You                were told to call us.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; I                was told to call you.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Wonderful.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; By?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; By                your direct contact above?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah.                  If you want to call it that.

[laughter] What people have                  to understand is that human beings are a supernatural transdimensional                  being that&rsquo;s made in the image of the Creator of the                  universe, just like the Bible says.

So that if                  we get to a level of revelation, it&rsquo;s not just for our                  own purpose to use greedily; it&rsquo;s to serve the entire                  body of mankind. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the best way to think of mankind is not just, you know,                  in this plane of time/space, but mankind is a non-local being                  that stretches across the cosmos, and into the past, present                  and future. OK? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So when                    you start to grasp that and you have that intuitive.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.                  That&rsquo;s why I tell people... When I try to do talks,                  I say: <em>You know, there are two groups of &ldquo;religions&rdquo; on                  Earth. There&rsquo;s those that believe in reincarnation and                  those that don&rsquo;t believe in reincarnation.</em> Right?                  And the reason is, they&rsquo;re both right and wrong.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And the reason is, for them, that&rsquo;s their                  level of understanding because that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re                  at. When you become truly intuitive at the highest levels,                  there&rsquo;s no such thing as reincarnation.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Sure, because we&rsquo;re                eternal beings.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. Once you start grasping that, it&rsquo;s                  like the words of Yeshua Ha'Mashiach Jesus that says, you know, <em>Though                  you do it to the least of my brothers, you have done it to                  me.</em> If you actually felt the pain of allowing your government                  to attack and blow up little girls in Baghdad, you wouldn&rsquo;t                  do it because it would be like a neuron connected to another                  being. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Or you wouldn&rsquo;t walk by a plant starving for                  water without watering it.

In other                  words.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t do these things, because you&rsquo;re                  doing it to yourself.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.

OK? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yes. But let&rsquo;s get back to this, because we                  have Reptilians influencing the Illuminati agenda. And we&rsquo;ve                  got an agenda that&rsquo;s being rolled out on a bunch of eternal                  beings that don&rsquo;t really recognize their eternalness.                  And so how&rsquo;s it going to play out?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well, first, the thing that I&rsquo;ve                found...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Why                has this been allowed to get so far?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s                    allowed to get so far for a couple of reasons. The most important                    thing in the universe for sentient beings is to have free                  choice. In other words, to choose to remember. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A lot of                    people think that, you know, you&rsquo;re going through                  life to learn things, or to prove a point or to reach something,                  you know, like a point system, like a grade. And that if you                  reach a certain grade, you can transcend -- which is totally                  garbage. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s like my little daughter with Down&rsquo;s Syndrome,                  she doesn&rsquo;t have to earn points to be my daughter.

Or to fill                  in dogma. And, of course, it&rsquo;s interesting -- the word <em>dogma</em> means &ldquo;am-God&rdquo;,                  backwards. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They&rsquo;re                    being told that <em>they</em> should decide                  what&rsquo;s good or evil rather than deciding from the spirit                  by making that connection. Because the only way for people                  to connect and not have an eternal matrix is to have the spirit                  inside them. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Now the problem I see is this: People have to discern.                  There&rsquo;s two groups in the universe.

So in a sense you&rsquo;re                    in a state of what I call <em>spirit sleep.</em> Your spirit&rsquo;s                    asleep so that it can then start to reawaken its connectedness                  with everyone else. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK. But what&rsquo;s                    the nuts and bolts to how this plays out, though, at the                  moment?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll just give you a little story. This                  is one of the most recent ones. Roughly one year ago... And                  I get visions <em>and</em> dreams. OK? And one of my primary                  roles isn&rsquo;t to be a doctor or a whistleblower or a radio                  host. Those are all secondary. And really, to be honest with                  you, they&rsquo;re just a vehicle to try to get the real truth                  out -- which isn&rsquo;t just <em>facts</em>. Because the problem                  is, we have a <em>sea</em> of facts.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Mm                hm.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; But it doesn&rsquo;t change people. For example,                  when you look at the anomalies around 9/11, how many people                  have insisted that there&rsquo;s a proper investigation? Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. And they&rsquo;re not. Just to follow the                  financial side and all the other anomalies... And we still                  have all these factions, even in the so-called 9/11 movement. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, it&rsquo;s the same way with &ldquo;religion.&rdquo; I                  call it &ldquo;real lies going on.&rdquo; They have their dogma                  they cling to because... It&rsquo;s what they call their &ldquo;hell                  insurance,&rdquo; because they&rsquo;re fearful of knowing                  these things out here, of hell, or separation, or whatever                  it is, at the end of their physical life. So hence they kind                  of stuff themselves with dogma so that they can feel safe.                  Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Mm hm. OK. But you&rsquo;ve just told us you have                  three roles that are your secondary roles.

Now, I&rsquo;m not talking about Monty Python,                  fill the stadium with prophets. And there&rsquo;s many different                  prophets. For example, I had on the show last week John Boncore/Splitting                  the Sky. And I really believe that there are many people, especially                  now, that there is a prophetic role for them. OK?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Sure.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And they&rsquo;re from all different nations, colors,                  peoples, whatever, on the Earth.

And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I believe I was told                  to call you. I kind of come from the perspective... I                  want people to get rid of &ldquo;religion&rdquo; and get, in                  every moment, into spirituality. In other words, don&rsquo;t                  go to church on Sunday and think you&rsquo;re safe all week,                  or whatever other day you like.
