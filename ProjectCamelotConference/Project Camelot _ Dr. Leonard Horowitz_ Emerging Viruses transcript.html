KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  Hi, I&rsquo;m Kerry Cassidy. A few months ago, I had
the good fortune to interview Dr. Leonard Horowitz. He&rsquo;s a well
known author and an expert on emerging diseases. He wrote a book
that&rsquo;s, I think, most widely known, <I>Emerging
Viruses, AIDS, and Ebola.</I>

<br><br>

Recently
he talked to me for a short while about water and about the whole
<I>Live H2O</I>
effort, and also about the health field and a myriad of other topics,
in a very short span of time. I think that you will enjoy hearing
from him here.
<br><br>

LEONARD
HOROWITZ (LH):  Hi, my name is Dr. Leonard Horowitz, and I have
produced about 16 books. I have three national best sellers. I deal
with subjects that are the <I>worst
of the worst</I> news on the
planet and also the <I>best of
the best</I> news.

<br><br>

So
if you really want to find out the sad reality regarding the genocide
that&rsquo;s ongoing under the guise of public health and national
security &ndash; the
military/ medical/ petrochemical/
pharmaceutical cartel
and the industrialists that actually make money off of humanity&rsquo;s
suffering, and control minds as well as populations, as well as
population reduction...

<br><br>

The
works that I&rsquo;ve published include <I>Death
in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare</I>
that came out three months before September 11th.

<br><br>

The
book -- <I>Emerging Viruses,
AIDS, and Ebola: Nature, Accident or Intentional? </I>--
that Reverend Jeremiah Wright mentioned on national television in the
heat of the Barack Obama campaign concerning the origin of AIDS, and
the Anglo-American thesis on how this is a genocidal weapon. It&rsquo;s
the documentations that I published &ndash; literally US government
documents, contracts &ndash; in that book that enabled him and
empowered him to make those claims.
<br><br>

So,
I&rsquo;ve done a number of works in the field of public health,
overlapping national security, Central Intelligence Agency, British
Secret Service.

<br><br>

Currently,
if you go to <U><A HREF="https://www.fluscam.com/" target="_blank">www.fluscam.com</A></U>
, you&rsquo;ll see that I&rsquo;ve uncovered the underlying truth
concerning the current flu pandemic and its implications, and
indicting Baxter Corporation, as well as the company named <I>Novovax
--</I> who in collaboration
with British officials at the UK, as well as World Health
Organizations think-tanks concerning viruses and vaccines for
influenza, Dr. Robertson, etc -- these people are implicated in
actually creating, loosing the current flu that&rsquo;s circulating.
So that&rsquo;s the bad news.

<br><br>

The
great news is that I&rsquo;m here in Laguna Beach today to honor Dr.
Masaru Emoto, who&rsquo;s a friend and a colleague, who is my hero
and a lot of peoples&rsquo; hero, for creating this whole
understanding of water.

<br><br>

<I>Live
H2O</I>: <I>Concert
for the Living Water</I> is
about celebrating all the knowledge, the truths that have been
suppressed about water and water science that literally have the
capacity to free humanity <I>completely</I>
from all the urgencies, including the petrochemical pollution, the
degradation of the environment. We can turn to hydrogen and hydrogen
from water for hydrogen fuel to run automobiles.
<br><br>

We
can turn to a product called <I>OxySilver</I>
or <I>silver hydrosols</I>
in general for literally presenting a nano-particle-sized silver,
bonded to water, that&rsquo;s less than five parts per million, that
can eliminate <I>all</I>
infectious diseases from planet Earth and restore some semblance of
sanity to what is currently the medical hypocrisy of intoxicating
humanity with foreign RNA and DNA from bacteria, viruses, fungus,
yeast, chicken embryo, bovine fetal serum, monkey kidney tissues, in
these things called <I>vaccinations</I>.
<br><br>

Antibiotics
&ndash; we can completely do away with antibiotics.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
interesting that we&rsquo;re conducting war against everything: war,
anti-biosis, anti-biology, war against AIDS, war against cancer, war
against all of these things.

<br><br>

Well,
gee whiz, why don&rsquo;t we do something <I>pro?</I>
-- p<I>ro</I>actively,
preventatively and positively, <I>pro</I>biotically?
And we can do that with the understanding that we&rsquo;re advancing
in water and water science.

<br><br>

So
it turns out that all of the greatest truths, including what your DNA
actually does that&rsquo;s based on water, is about to be revealed
with the <I>Concert for the
Living Water.</I>

<br><br>

So
my work also deals with the <I>best
of the best</I> there is in
solving the planet&rsquo;s worst problems, and it&rsquo;s an honor
and a privilege for me to join you today.
<br><br>

KC:
 [laughs] Okay, that&rsquo;s a great introduction, very
comprehensive. What do you think about how the global Powers That Be
are going to deal with your solutions?
<br><br>

LH:
 Well, the Powers That Be are obviously not supportive to coming out
with the truths that can emancipate humanity completely, so they have
done a lot of suppression.

<br><br>

The
mainstream, mass-mind-control-enslaving-media, is essentially largely
to blame, because we&rsquo;re supposed to have freedom of the press
and now we have corporate control &ndash; multinational
corporate-controlled media.

<br><br>

And
we&rsquo;re supposed to have, in fact, in the United States, a
balance of powers that is largely based on freedom of the press. But,
unfortunately, Associated Press and a couple of other news services
provide virtually 98% of the news.

<br><br>

If
they don&rsquo;t want to cover something -- such as what the drug
industrialists and the petrochemical polluters don&rsquo;t want to
have revealed, such as alternatives, green technologies &ndash; well,
it gets suppressed. So it&rsquo;s not likely that we&rsquo;re going
to receive a lot of support from that domain.

<br><br>

But,
the great news is that it&rsquo;s a grass-roots initiative, that
there&rsquo;s a decentralization of power that&rsquo;s happened with
<I>Live H2O: Concert for the
Living Water.</I>

<br><br>

We
have over 70 venues internationally and it&rsquo;s still growing
daily. All of those are organized and run, and all the volunteers,
serving independent organizations that are not doing this for the
money. They&rsquo;re doing this because there&rsquo;s an urgency of
need at this time in history.
<br><br>

KC:
 So this is a one-weekend event, though, is it not?

<br><br>

LH:
 This is a one-weekend event. <I>Live
H2O</I> is June 19th to the
21st, 2009. It&rsquo;s an historic event. It is the most spiritually
uplifting and important concert in Earth&rsquo;s history.

<br><br>

It
has profound implications, not just this weekend, however. It has
ongoing implications insofar as: <I>Where
are we going as a civilization? Where are we going as intelligent
people?</I>
<br><br>

You
know, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of multi-national corporation officials
choose the path that we&rsquo;ve followed so far... and basically we
haven&rsquo;t gotten too advanced.

<br><br>

We
call ourselves an <I>&ldquo;advanced
civilization,&rdquo;</I> but in
fact... I came back from New York last weekend. On the front page of
the <I>New Yorker Magazine</I>
was, literally, a feature story, entitled <I>Extinction
of the Human Race</I>.

<br><br>

And
so, we&rsquo;re really looking at a time in history where we&rsquo;ve
got to make a choice and the choice has never been greater, clearer;
and, in fact, either graver or more uplifting.

<br><br>

That
choice is simply: <I>Are we
going to tell the truth? Are we going to tell the ways, and look at
the practical applications, of what&rsquo;s called hydrosonics?</I>


<br><br>

<I>Hydo</I>
&ndash; water; <I>sonics</I>
-- is sound frequency vibration. That&rsquo;s the core creative
technology. If we want to recreate ourselves and recreate this
planet, then what we&rsquo;ve got to look at are those truths.

<br><br>

KC:
 Are you working with Dr. Emoto on this technology?
<br><br>

LH:
 Yes. Dr. Emoto and I are long-term friends. In fact, I had the
privilege, actually, down here in Orange County, to have opened for
Dr. Emoto on the first lecture that he ever gave in the United
States. On his first night in the United States, with his first book
in the United States, I actually got the first autographed copy of
that book. I showed it to Dr. Emoto some years later and he was
surprised to actually see it.

<br><br>

But
I have a water science mentor that was the same water science mentor
that Dr. Masaru Emoto had, Dr. Lee Lorenzen. He had a place in Orange
County, and he developed the first <I>structured
water</I>. So we really go way
back.

<br><br>

Now
it&rsquo;s a privilege, it&rsquo;s an honor for me to have witnessed
Dr. Emoto&rsquo;s great success all over the world, but also to have
been a small part in that success.

<br><br>

He
calls me his chief scientific validator and chief scientist involved
in really looking at everything that he&rsquo;s doing and how it
relates to the most advanced fields of genetics, electro-genetics,
water science, frequency resonance, bioenergetics; looking at the
human body &ndash; body water that is &ndash; as well as all the
water, as a liquid-crystal, super-conductor. It&rsquo;s virtually the
creative juice of the universe.
<br><br>

What
Dr. Emoto&rsquo;s fantastic contribution is, that -- we all are just
so thrilled to have him have made -- is that this water, this
incredible creative juice, has this intelligence. It&rsquo;s
literally Divine.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
that way in the Bible. It&rsquo;s talked about in the Book of
Genesis. Genesis 1-1, 1-2 tells you in the beginning there was the
water, even before the Holy Spirit is mentioned in the Bible. Even
before the Word was spoken, <I>Let
there be light</I>, there was
the water.

<br><br>

So,
water&rsquo;s really part of the triune God in theology, in
Judeo-Christian and Muslim theology.
<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
revered by all of the cultures, whether it&rsquo;s Buddhism or Indian
Hindu. It&rsquo;s always consistent, every culture, Hawaiian Kahunas,
everyone, the Aboriginal people of Australia. They&rsquo;re all
celebrating with us this <I>Live
H2O</I> weekend, because they
all understand water is literally part of this Divine substance, this
sustaining creative juice.

<br><br>

Dr.
Emoto&rsquo;s incredible work tells us that it&rsquo;s not only
responsive to our prayers &ndash; just like angels, just like the
Creator &ndash; but also this concept that it has a <I>shifting</I>
of its actual structure, which means it&rsquo;s not only intelligent,
but it changes its structure in such a way as to, incredibly, deliver
personal messages to us &ndash; messages that are very, very
important, that speak to love, that speak to planetary sustenance,
that speak to our own spiritual evolution and well-being as a
civilization.

<br><br>

So,
all of these wonderful contributions Dr. Emoto has made, we&rsquo;re
here tonight in Laguna Beach, California, to celebrate.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Well, do you consider yourself a healer?
<br><br>

LH:
 This question is: Do <I>I
consider myself a healer?</I> I
would say that pretty much all of us are really healers when it gets
right down to it, you know.

<br><br>

This
concept, for example, of the living water being in each of us, and
this concept that Jesus best demonstrated... how he healed people
miraculously was through his faith and trust. Whenever he performed
these miraculous healings, he would always tell everybody: <I>It&rsquo;s
by your faith and trust that you&rsquo;re healed.</I>
<br><br>

So
faith and trust and prayer &ndash; the spoken word, which is very
powerful, the creative technology &ndash; and this heartfelt, loving
intention to produce a blessing is not unique to Jesus. It&rsquo;s
not unique to Len Horowitz. It&rsquo;s not unique to Dr. Masaru
Emoto. In fact, it&rsquo;s in every single one of you, and it&rsquo;s
really a basic fact. So, I think we are all natural healers.

<br><br>

I
think right now we&rsquo;re engaged in a time of revealing that great
truth, and then getting beyond the mind control, the dumbing down of
the population to make us believe that we&rsquo;ve got to pop magic
pills to cure every ill. How totally absurd, how we think that we&rsquo;ve
got to get vaccinated in order to have immuno-capacity to resist
infectious diseases! That&rsquo;s insane.
<br><br>

In
fact, all the science is actually showing that the most deadly of all
of the diseases is <I>iatrogenesis</I>.
It&rsquo;s
physician-induced illnesses brought on by faith and trust in what I
call Medical Deities... you know: MDs. It&rsquo;s paganism. The Bible
talks about that.

<br><br>

And
basically the Bible stories are full of times when pagans got
Judgment Day coming. You know, they got what they sowed: <I>As
you sow, so shall you reap.</I>
So where you place your faith and trust is extremely important in
this age.


<br><br>

KC:
 So are you saying that you believe in Judgment Day?
<br><br>

LH:
 I believe that Judgment Day is happening every day. As a matter of
fact, right now, we know when we look at Dr. Emoto&rsquo;s work in
water and water science, that what this incredibly miraculous,
vibrating liquid-crystal, super-conductor really is... it&rsquo;s a
judgment apparatus. Judgment is like karma. It&rsquo;s the concept of
<I>What goes around comes
around. As you sow, so shall you reap.</I>


<br><br>

Well,
if you sow, for example, negativity... if you sow anger and
resentment, hostility, even sadness and depressed articulations and
feelings through your words, that sound resonance energy actually
impacts every single water molecule in your body &ndash; instantly.
So, judgment is instantaneous.

<br><br>

All
of this is incredibly just basic understanding from the magnificent
work that Dr. Emoto has done to reveal the consciousness in water,
the way that water responds to prayer, that water responds to words
such as <I>I love you</I>
or <I>I hate you,</I>
or it responds to beautiful music heartfeltly rendered in a way for
healing &ndash; versus some completely dissonant energy vibration
from the most unconscious types of music that literally <I>break</I>
the structures of water, break the sacred geometry &ndash; that has
now been shown to be produced in response to heartfelt, loving
intention and blessedness.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. I know you&rsquo;re a doctor by profession. Right?
<br><br>

LH:
 Yes. I have three Doctorates, actually. I have a Doctorate in
Medical Dentistry from Tufts University; I taught on the faculties of
Tufts. At Harvard University, I spoke on Behavioral Science issues
and microanatomy &ndash; it&rsquo;s called histology &ndash; and I
taught dental as well as medical students. I have a Masters in Public
Health from Harvard.

<br><br>

My
area of special expertise, beyond emerging diseases, is in Behavioral
Science, looking at the way the mainstream media manipulates peoples&rsquo;
minds to literally dumb us down and engage us into these deceptions
that end up costing our lives, really.
<br><br>

KC:
 So, you&rsquo;re saying you specialized in media as a part of
Behavioral Science? Because that&rsquo;s not actually what Behavioral
Science is involved with.
<br><br>

LH:
 That&rsquo;s right. I specialize mostly in Behavioral Science media,
health education, health promotion.
<br><br>

KC:
 I see.

<br><br>

LH:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 So, did you go through sort of a transition, or a trajectory, in
your own journey, your own personal journey that sort of changed the
way you approached the medical field?
<br><br>

LH:
 Oh, I did! I went through my own personal journey that was pretty
intense, having lost a mother to a vaccination, and, ultimately,
didn&rsquo;t even know it when it was happening. I had to find out
later that... it was just hideous.

<br><br>

The
flu vaccines that they&rsquo;re even pumping out right now and
telling us they&rsquo;re so necessary... in fact, the urgency right
now is people need to wake up immediately, because the Barack Obama
administration is about to legislate every American getting three flu
shots this coming fall, 2009. So we&rsquo;d better wake up.

<br><br>

I
woke up too late. It cost my mother her life. And, in fact, tens of
thousands of Americans, who received the 1976 Swine Flu vaccine,
ended up with Guillain-Barre, an auto-immune disease -- that was
devastating.
<br><br>

And
so, this is what my mother received, and at the time, I didn&rsquo;t
even know. In fact, at the time that she was dying, I was engaged in
educating. As a public health professional, the standard education
that we all received in dental, medical, public health education is
that vaccines are safe and effective.

<br><br>

I
was actually teaching that, and so, I&rsquo;m likely responsible for
thousands of nurses and physicians and dentists and hygienists, to
actually have them develop auto-immune diseases from inoculations of
the Hepatitis B vaccine that I heavily promoted, as literally
somebody who&rsquo;d been brainwashed.
<br><br>

KC:
 Hmm. Well, I understand that you actually took your daughter out of
school recently to avoid a vaccination. Isn&rsquo;t that right?
<br><br>

LH:
 Actually, specifically, it was the Tuberculosis Skin Test. I took my
children out of school in Hawaii, and we&rsquo;re not even living in
Hawaii anymore.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
boycotting living in Hawaii, because it is a completely barbaric and
fascist state over there, whereby they literally do not even allow
<I>anyone</I>,
any child, even in private schools, to enter school without a
Tuberculosis Skin Test &ndash; which is virtually the same as
vaccination. It&rsquo;s the same in terms of injecting into your
bloodstream foreign proteins and foreign DNA and RNA -- in this case,
the <I>Tuberculosis bacillus</I>
fragments.

<br><br>

And
so this <I>wheal reaction</I>
that they call <I>a positive
test</I> actually is a <I>systemic</I>
reaction. They hide that fact, and so I did not want to give my
children anything that would violate the sanctity of their holy
spiritual temples. I honor my children.

<br><br>

They&rsquo;re
very healthy without ever having been vaccinated against anything. We
practice natural medicine. We&rsquo;re very conscious about what we
eat, what we drink, and how we live our lives, ideally minimizing
stress.
<br><br>

And
so what we&rsquo;ve chosen to do is pull our children out of this,
unfortunately, indoctrination system that has been going under the
guise of education.
<br><br>

KC:
 Are you going to be staying in the United States with Codex coming
down?
<br><br>

LH:
 I think Codex Alimentarius legislation is going to impact everybody
worldwide. The concept is &ndash; quote, unquote &ndash;
&ldquo;harmonization&rdquo; for the entire planet under the guise of
&ldquo;health and safety.&rdquo;

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
actually a mechanism to regulate access to all botanicals, natural
healing remedies, the homeopathics, vitamins, minerals, supplements
-- everything having to do with natural health and healing.
<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
part of this global industrial manipulation of the population and the
decimation of our rights, our freedoms. One of those freedoms is the
right to God&rsquo;s bounty and nature&rsquo;s bounty, and that...

<br><br>

You
know, the Bible is full of revelations and verses that talk about how
<I>the healing of</I>
<I>the nations shall come by
the leaves and the trees that line the banks of the water,</I>
the living water, which are our bloodstreams. So, all around us, we
have all of these beautiful, natural healing remedies.

<br><br>

I
work as an ambassador for the World Organization of Natural Medicine.
And the project that is really dear to my heart; and [in] many of my
colleagues&rsquo; hearts, is the Clinics for Humanity project, where
all over the world, we are establishing natural healing clinics and
inviting residents to come and learn natural healing and serve in
these places voluntarily.

<br><br>

At
the end of six years, after studying in rigorous curriculums that are
on the Internet right now, we can certify their Natural Medicine
Degree and get them to the place where they can then become
Board-Certified, then licensed in a certain state, and then practice
Natural Medicine as Naturopathic Physicians.

<br><br>

So,
this is really important. If we don&rsquo;t do it now, this concept
of natural healing and the wisdom of the elders and the natural
methods of the holy medicine men and women... that will be gone
forever. It&rsquo;s vitally important for our children and our
children&rsquo;s children to sustain this brilliant wisdom.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. But how is Codex going to affect that?
<br><br>

LH:
 Codex Alimentarius legislation is intending to eliminate your access
to all of the natural medicinals, as I mentioned, the homeopathics,
the vitamins, the minerals, the supplements.
<br><br>

KC:
 How will it affect the people graduating from your program that
you&rsquo;re talking about? Will they be able to practice?
<br><br>

LH:
 Oh, I see. I get your question. Well, in terms of the people that I
am working with who are advancing the certification program for World
Organization of Natural Medicine, the concept is that these people
are going to be operating as <I>Sovereigns</I>.


<br><br>

For
example, they are going to be entitled to practice medicine outside
the typical statutory laws, that really violate God&rsquo;s laws, and
so it requires a whole different level of jurisdiction, of
legislative recognition.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;re working on, on various levels, various governments.
Our latest &ldquo;wins&rdquo; have been in the country of Lebanon and
many of the...

<br><br>

Sadly
&ndash; I speak as a Christian Jew and an American &ndash; sadly, I
have to tell you that the most advanced countries in the world are
those Muslim nations, those Arabic nations, who understand that what
we&rsquo;re looking at here is an Anglo-American genocidal operation
that Codex Alimentarius is actually advancing.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
a regulation of our basic fundamental understanding of health, of
Divinity, how it can impact humanity, natural ways of remedying all
of the urgencies.

<br><br>

You
know, this is really what we&rsquo;ve got to support, so that&rsquo;s
one of the things that we&rsquo;re doing with <I>Live
H2O: Concert for the Living Water</I>
on behalf of our co-sponsor, World Organization for Natural Medicine,
to advance this understanding and gratitude, literally for all of the
people in the Muslim world who understand that this is, indeed, a
holy war.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
a holy war when you think of the fact that we are spiritual beings
and that to keep from us these natural remedies that the Creator had
meant to give us, so that we can sustain ourselves &ndash; that is a
spiritual attack. And that&rsquo;s what Codex Alimentarius
legislation is.
<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
what this whole flu vaccination campaign really is about. It&rsquo;s
really about intoxicating, with the number one foremost genocidal
weapon &ndash; vaccination &ndash; the entire global population. And
there are a lot of people that are not going to go along with it.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. So what is your solution? You said something about becoming
Sovereign on the part of the natural practitioners. You&rsquo;re
talking about seceding
from actual US citizenship and doing all of that?
<br><br>

LH:
 Yes. I have colleagues... I&rsquo;m not an expert in that field, and
I would highly urge everybody to study with some good experts in this
field.

<br><br>

Once
you, do your eyes open. You begin to realize: <I>Gee
whiz, you know, how did I get my Birth Certificate? What does my
Birth Certificate really mean? What does my Social Security number
really mean?</I>

<br><br>

<I>What
is it connected to, financially, in the global unity core, in the
global exchange system, the Uniform Commercial Code, and the systems
of &ldquo;laws&rdquo; that really govern how money operates, and how
we operate in a jurisdiction of commercial law? </I>

<br><br>

So
these are very important areas of study. You know, rather than
science and mathematics, and even reading, writing, and arithmetic in
grade school, we really should be taught, number one, fundamentally
who we are as human beings. <I>What
is our connection to the living God? You know, how does God live in
us and how does God operate in us?</I>


<br><br>

And,
you know, what is this whole field of metaphysics all about? How come
some people are completely psychic? How did they get that way? What
facilitates that?

<br><br>

How
can Leonardo da Vinci, his complete creative genius...?

<br><br>

I
am the author of the book, <I>Love:
The Real da Vinci Code</I>,
where I&rsquo;ve decrypted the real da Vinci code in his famous
drawing, the Vitruvian Woman. There&rsquo;s a woman behind the man in
that famous drawing with four arms, four legs, and a head.

<br><br>

And
that is really who we are. We&rsquo;re engaged in a cosmic balance
that is mathematically, musically, harmonically, administered, and
that is all happening because of water and sound &ndash; frequency
vibration &ndash; which is mathematics.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
vitally important knowledge, you know, not just <I>The
truth that shall set us free,</I>
but the greatest truths, including <I>Know
Thyself</I>.

<br><br>

<I>What
are the greatest truths about you? And how do you then take those
magnificent truths, those sacred truths and wisdom, and apply it in
your daily lives? </I>

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
a book that we should be getting when we become parents, in how to
raise, rear, a child and be response-able, truly responsibility for
another human being. We should have a manual on how to take care of
that human being and a definition of what that human being really is
all about.

<br><br>

And
so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re engaged in right now. It&rsquo;s a
whole transcendence. It&rsquo;s a whole paradigm shift. It&rsquo;s a
whole spiritual renaissance. It&rsquo;s a celebration, ultimately, of
humanity&rsquo;s finest revelations.
<br><br>

KC:
 But what about the political situation? In other words, if your
solution is Sovereignty, do you think that the government is actually
going to go along with that?

<br><br>

LH:
 Of course not. If the solution is Sovereignty, the governments and
the drug industrialists &ndash; what I call the military/ medical/
petrochemical/ pharmaceutical cartel &ndash; are not going to go
along with that, because everything that they&rsquo;re doing is
engaged in just the opposite: a complete enslavement.

<br><br>

From
birth to grave, you&rsquo;re regulated, intoxicated, manipulated,
mass mind-controlled. And that is ultimately something that is one of
the truths that shall set us free &ndash; just the recognition of
that.

<br><br>

You
know, before you can practice medicine, you&rsquo;ve got to
understand diagnosis. The word itself says it all. <I>Diagnosis</I>:
to know through, the seeing-through to the root cause. That&rsquo;s
what the word means.

<br><br>

So
in order for us to treat ourselves and treat our social pathology,
we&rsquo;ve got to really see through to the root cause of it all.
<br><br>

KC:
 Right.
<br><br>

LH:
 And really there&rsquo;re some fabulous simple truths now that are
extremely uplifting that <I>Live
H2O: Concert for the Living Water</I>
and everything that&rsquo;s written on the concert website --
<U><A HREF="https://www.liveh2o.org/" target="_blank">https://www.liveh2o.org/</A></U>
-- is going to be revealing, and people are celebrating
internationally the revelations.
<br><br>

KC:
 So, you&rsquo;re interested in changing consciousness, obviously, in
part through this event that you&rsquo;re taking part in; but, what
I&rsquo;m wondering is, what is your solution for people that are
facing this Codex coming down sometime, I believe, in January of
2010?
<br><br>

LH:
 Well, quite frankly, if you ask me what my solution is to Codex
Alimentarius and this global manipulation of the population, the
answer is we don&rsquo;t have an answer. The Creator has an answer. I
believe I have some awareness of what the Creator has in store for
humanity. It would probably take us another half an hour for me to
lay it out for you.

<br><br>

But
the reality is, I don&rsquo;t think most people... clearly most
people are not prepared to even hear the answer. Most people think
that the answer is silly or foolish conspiracy nonsense.

<br><br>

And
so I can see, as anybody whose eyes are open to the current reality
that the future does not bode well for most people on this planet.
<br><br>

The
answer then lies not so much in the physical reality that&rsquo;s
going on here, but literally in the transcendence of that, and the
purification and the spiritual uplifting &ndash; virtually the
emancipation of the burdened spirit that we all now have, coming out
of this <I>cult-ture,</I>
this American medical or global manipulative <I>cult-ture,</I>
which we&rsquo;ve been raised in and we&rsquo;ve established the
beliefs and the behaviors consistent with that manipulation and
indoctrination.

<br><br>

<I>Come
out of her, my people, lest ye be infected by her plagues.</I>
That&rsquo;s virtually a quote from Jesus.

<br><br>

So,
the reality is that you&rsquo;ve got to come out of it completely,
and there are ways -- intelligently, reasonably, responsibly -- to
come out of this hypocrisy. One of those ways is not going to get
vaccinated. And it&rsquo;s not going to Medical Deities to solve
every flu, or every cancer that you&rsquo;ve got going on. There&rsquo;s
a whole other realm!
<br><br>

Again,
when we talk about faith, simple faith, and spirituality, and
metaphysical dynamics, and how all of metaphysics can now be
beautifully explained through mathematics, as well as this
hydrosonics &ndash; sound vibration on water &ndash; that&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;re celebrating this weekend.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. And, you know, it sounds like you&rsquo;re aware of the ET
visitation on the planet. You&rsquo;re not actually talking about
that at the moment, but, certainly, there is an ET element that&rsquo;s
been involved in what&rsquo;s going down here on the planet. Are you
part of, sort of, the philosophy that believes that we are going to
be moving into the fourth dimension?
<br><br>

LH:  Oh that&rsquo;s a
beautiful question. With regard to my view of extraterrestrial
existence, and whether currently we&rsquo;re engaged in this process,
in a spiritual renaissance sense, of moving into another dimension:
<I>absolutely</I>.
I absolutely, firmly believe that in my heart, and you&rsquo;re
listening to me say that after years of me being really unsure.

<br><br>

You
know, I&rsquo;ve been criticized and somewhat ostracized by the UFO
community, because part of my lecture has been saying, you know, as a
behavioral science expert, I can tell you that what we&rsquo;re
witnessing on this planet is not normal human behavior.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
really not witnessing genocide as anything that represents love and
empathy and compassion, as we have, most of us, in our hearts,

<br><br>

So,
there&rsquo;s a distinct difference. Somehow, a human being and
another entity are at vast ends of a spectrum of how to care for each
other, or collaborate.

<br><br>

And,
you know, the fact is that, because I&rsquo;ve been looking at it
more from a behavioral scientist&rsquo;s perspective and then have
had to come to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s not normal human
behavior; subsequent to that I&rsquo;ve now realized, through
personal revelations and experiences, that we&rsquo;re dealing with
the spiritual realm here.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
really dealing with the realm of the angels, and now I&rsquo;ve
experienced a lot of that, and so I&rsquo;ve matured a bit. I now can
tell you that it is exactly as Jesus said: <I>It
is not against flesh and blood with whom we do battle.</I>
There <I>are</I>
battles going on.

<br><br>

And
then, you know, I also go back into my love for the Bible and the Old
Testament to the Nephilim, the fallen angels; and the Elohim, the
multiple gods, when the Creator said to his friends, he says: <I>Hey
guys, let </I>us<I>
make man in </I>our <I>image.</I>
That&rsquo;s in the Torah.

<br><br>

So,
basically, it obviously recognizes that there are other lesser Gods;
there are spiritual entities. The Nephilim, Genesis tells us, outlive
the flood. Those are the fallen angels, the Herculeans, the super-men
and so&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 Do you believe that they are going to return soon?
<br><br>

LH:
 Do I believe that the&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 Nephilim.
<br><br>

LH:
 Well, I don&rsquo;t have any opinion on whether or not the Nephilim
are going to return soon.

<br><br>

I
think that a lot of what I&rsquo;m witnessing in government
malfeasance, official malfeasance, and the manipulation at the
highest levels of government... it&rsquo;s obvious that those people
are very dark. They&rsquo;ve got a lot of dark energy. And so, are
these super-men? Are they aliens? You know, it&rsquo;s really kind of
like an academic question.

<br><br>

The
more important question is: What are we going to do about it right
now to facilitate this extremely beautiful and blessed expansion of
our own love, our own hearts, our own transcendence of the physical
manipulations?

<br><br>

You
know, it&rsquo;s a complete miracle and, you know, grace of God that
we&rsquo;re still <I>alive</I>
here. We&rsquo;ve been so polluted &ndash; drinking fluoride in the
water, chlorine in the water, the food is contaminated, the
pesticides in the foods and the water supplies, the hormones that
have been injected into the chickens and into the beef -- all of
these ways that we&rsquo;ve been intoxicated -- the air that we&rsquo;re
breathing, chemtrail spray, pesticide spray.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
really a <I>miracle</I>
that we&rsquo;re still here.

<br><br>

So,
there&rsquo;s obviously a truth and a very high wisdom to we physical
beings come out of the spirit. And so, for literally salvation&rsquo;s
sake, physical salvation&rsquo;s sake, we&rsquo;ve got to <I>move</I>
into that spirit.

<br><br>

And
I believe that&rsquo;s what the Christian concept of <I>Rapture</I>
really is about. That&rsquo;s what I believe when Jesus said that:
<I>You will be </I>on<I>
the Earth, but no longer </I>of<I>
it.</I>

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
what I believe he was talking about, that metaphysically, now we&rsquo;re
advancing, opening our hearts, getting into the frequency vibration
of Divinity, to bless humanity, maximally. <I>That</I>
will sustain us, and nothing more.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Well, thank you very much, Len Horowitz. This has been quite
an encapsulation, but very, very, very well done. You&rsquo;re a very
good speaker and I appreciate all the energy that you put into this.

<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;d love to do is invite you onto our radio show. It&rsquo;s
obvious that you have areas where we could drill down into some of
the things you&rsquo;ve done in the past, some of your understanding
of the global situation in various countries, what&rsquo;s going on
there.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;d
love to talk to you about Africa in more depth. I&rsquo;d like to
hear what your thoughts are about Europe, about what&rsquo;s going on
in Europe, versus what&rsquo;s going on in the US, China. You know --
the different areas of the world.

<br><br>

Because,
not everywhere is actually experiencing this sort of shift we&rsquo;re
going through in the same way and at the same pace, if you will. So,
I think that that&rsquo;s actually sort of becoming the question of
the day, with the dollar being actually thrown out. It&rsquo;s as if
the US is being targeted to go down first, if you will, and I&rsquo;d
love to hear your thoughts on that.
<br><br>

LH:
 Sure. I&rsquo;d be happy to join you.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Great. All right, thank you very much.
<br><br>

LH:
 It&rsquo;s a pleasure.
