KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  It is very exciting what&rsquo;s happening, because
people are connecting all over the planet.
<br><br>

AARON
McCOLLUM (AM):  Yeah.
<br><br>

KC:
 And we&rsquo;re all a part of that. Who knows where it&rsquo;s going
to all lead, you know, eventually&hellip;
<br><br>

AM:
 People are waking up by the thousands. Just last night I was talking
to a gentleman, Vietnam veteran, who had served during the same time
that my dad and Dave Corso had served. That&rsquo;s almost&hellip; I
don&rsquo;t know if I told you that my dad and Dave served with each
other.
<br><br>

KC:
 [laughs] Yeah. I know, there&rsquo;s like so many synchronicities
that are happening.
<br><br>

AM:
 Yeah.
<br><br>

KC:
 So, I mean, that&rsquo;s completely bizarre. Not only are you
connected to Corso and Duncan, but your father is connected to Corso,
at least. And I mean, that in and of itself is&hellip; like where
does this come from? This is so bizarre.
<br><br>

AM:
 Well, as far as my family, it&rsquo;s absolute bloodline. I mean, I
just recently got some information that I have not yet confirmed, but
I did get some fairly-good information that my grandfather, who died
under mysterious causes &ndash; no autopsy, no funeral &ndash; was a
high military or government member in some aspect of Operation
Paperclip, who was one of the officials that was assigned in
relocating the German Nazi scientists.

<br><br>

KC:
 [inaudible]

<br><br>

AM:
 No, I&rsquo;m not.
<br><br>

KC:
 That&rsquo;s&hellip; well, that actually points to why you may have
ended up where you did.
<br><br>

AM:
 And my father and my sister.
<br><br>

KC:
 Right. Your sister&hellip;
<br><br>

AM:
 But I&rsquo;ve no knowledge of if my older brother was at all. I
don&rsquo;t think he was, but I do fear that he may be drawn in
because of his direct connections with NASA. He&rsquo;s climbed up
the ranks in the scientific field.
<br><br>

KC:
 Ah ha.
<br><br>

AM:
 He was diagnosed with autism as a kid, but his IQ was off the charts
and he is 32 now and he&rsquo;s got his Ph.D. in astronomical physics
and nano-technology. He works at Lamar University. He&rsquo;s the
youngest novice curator of the Houston Astronomical Society. He also
runs five different observatories and rubs elbows with top NASA
individuals.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay, but I have to say that that indicates that he is part of the
whole scene.
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes, I do agree&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 He may not&hellip;
<br><br>

AM:
 &hellip;but he may not know it.

<br><br>

KC:
 Maybe he hasn&rsquo;t been one of the&hellip; in terms of some of
the ways that you have buried memories, etcetera. But what you&rsquo;re
telling me about his background is just unequivocal &ndash;
especially, actually, believe it or not, <I>because</I>
of his autism&hellip;
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 &hellip;because autism is sort of a marker that they use.
<br><br>

AM:
 Project Thirteen.
<br><br>

KC:
 Yeah, we were talking about that. Let&rsquo;s talk about that;
that&rsquo;ll be really fascinating.
<br><br>

AM:
 Sure. And I think I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if I mentioned to you
that I have absolute confirmation that my sister has three children.
The oldest one, Baden, is a contactee.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 Absolute.

<br><br>

KC:
 Yeah.
<br><br>

AM:
 But I can tell you what my sister actually witnessed and saw him do.
We can talk about that another time, but it is absolutely amazing.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.

<br><br>

AM:
 I did let Miriam Delicado know and I told her what my sister had
said. Miriam, of course, said: <I>You
know this child needs to be protected. Be careful who&hellip;</I>
And then I explained to my sister what Miriam had said. So&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 Well, that&rsquo;s actually a good thing.
<br><br>

AM:
 Yeah. I&rsquo;m actually going to be getting my sister in contact
with Miriam.
<br><br>

KC:
 Cool. Very good. I wasn&rsquo;t actually sure of how to categorize
you. Like, you know, I mean, not specifically a Super-Soldier that I
know of, but maybe -- and you know what I&rsquo;m saying? I wanted
you to categorize yourself.
<br><br>

AM:
 Sure.
<br><br>

KC:
 Why don&rsquo;t you just go ahead, introduce yourself, and basically
explain not only who you are, briefly, like your credentials,
whatever you would call that&hellip;
<br><br>

AM:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

KC:
 &hellip;but then also say why you&rsquo;re coming forward at this
time.
<br><br>

AM:
 Okay. Well, my name is Aaron Egan McCollum. I was born September 6,
1978, and my&hellip; Well, I was in the military. I served in the
United States Coast Guard for just roughly ten years; I&rsquo;m right
at the ten-year mark. And I was involved in many different Black Op
projects all over the world, and even many States-sides.
<br><br>

I
had climbed up the ranks very quickly to where I became a team member
of a first-of-its-kind unit in the Coast Guard, which is known
publicly, but a lot of the operations they do are&hellip; most of
what they do are not well-known.

<br><br>

If
I had to classify myself, it would be that I&rsquo;m third-generation
Project Talent, and because of the bloodline I came from, I was given
a lot of responsibility and saw a lot of things and even since that
time have been called back for specific operations.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 I mean, to really explain who I am would obviously be good for the
more extended interview to really explain that.

<br><br>

But,
you know, obviously I&rsquo;m coming out today for the first time
really publicly to explain about information that I have through
absolute reliable contacts &ndash; which I cannot name for their
safety &ndash; but involving what&rsquo;s going on in the Gulf of
Aden in Yemen, specifically what the Global Elite are doing, and the
stargate which is absolutely real. It&rsquo;s not fantasy.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
like, Kerry, what you and I talked about many times: things you see
in movies are put there as a ruse to automatically give this label of
&ldquo;fantasy, science fiction,&rdquo; so people will not dig in
anymore and they&rsquo;ll live in their little world of &ldquo;<I>it&rsquo;s
make-believe</I>&rdquo;.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. That&rsquo;s great. So you were a member of the Coast Guard,
but you also ended up not only working in these teams of Special Ops
units, for lack of a better title, but you were the leader, isn&rsquo;t
that true?
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes. And Project Talent has really two sides &ndash; they have the
people that never were in the military [as] civilians, but worked
directly in the military, even sometimes would wear military
uniforms, but never went to boot camp. You know, they have their own
side of that &ndash; Duncan, for example; Duncan O&rsquo;Finioan, who
never really went to boot camp, but was absolutely Project Talent.

<br><br>

Then
there are people like me. This is where it gets a little complicated.
I did not choose the branch of service. When I was 16, certain
individuals &ndash; agents -- came to me and told me which branch of
the military I was going in and when it would happen, so I already
knew two years before joining.
<br><br>

So
I was in the military; I got regular military training. But at times
when I would be temporarily assigned &ndash; it&rsquo;s called TAD;
Temporary Assignment Duty &ndash; to other units, I wasn&rsquo;t
actually doing what was known by my commanding officer or whomever at
the time. I was actually conducting&hellip; increasing my training
that I had started when I was very young.

<br><br>

So
I wore two hats. There were times when I was Petty Officer McCollum,
worked my way up to being Chief Engineer on ships and doing Special
Op rescue, drug interdiction, whatever. And then I had the other hat
where I was just an agent &ndash; no name, no denomination of rank;
nothing.
<br><br>

KC:
 So when you say you were doing that, are you meaning that you, I
don&rsquo;t know&hellip; you would not carry any papers of
identification on you?
<br><br>

AM:
 Absolutely not. No ID. Couldn&rsquo;t even wear a watch; nothing.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. And on those assignments&hellip; Is that where your sort of
buried memories are coming back, in regard to those assignments?
<br><br>

AM:
 Honestly, it&rsquo;s happening on both sides because, as I said,
it&rsquo;s kind of complicated, but let me try to explain as best as
I can.

<br><br>

I
did a lot of operations where I just wore my Coast Guard hat and I
was Petty Officer McCollum, but I was actually leading &ldquo;umbrella
operations&rdquo; that actually had a Black Operation happening
underneath that I was tied to.
<br><br>

So
they would have me close to that, so that I would be able to
infiltrate and do my other job that was assigned to me. So with that,
because there was such intertwining of operations, a lot of it is
foggy on both sides.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. So let&rsquo;s see&hellip; because it&rsquo;s really easy for
me to go down this rabbit-hole [Aaron laughs] with you and start
following out your personal remembrances, but I think that today&rsquo;s
interview, at least for the first part&hellip;

<br><br>

Let&rsquo;s
do this first: let&rsquo;s talk about the Gulf of Aden, and why
you&rsquo;re specifically coming forward now, before we do a more
formal interview that has been planned with you for several weeks. So
let&rsquo;s talk about the most crucial stuff that you want to get
out there right away, and then we can digress from there. Then we can
later decide what to cut in, what to cut out.
<br><br>

AM:
 Okay. Let me just make this statement; I want to make this perfectly
clear. What I&rsquo;m about to let everyone know is based on actual
facts, articles; also contacts &ndash; absolute, reliable contacts &ndash;
who have contacted me within the past month; overwhelming amount of
information. And this is also based directly on operations that I was
a part of, that I&rsquo;ve regained some memories back, from July of
2008 until the beginning of March of 2009.
<br><br>

Operations
I was a part of absolutely relate directly to what is happening now
in the Gulf of Aden.

<br><br>

Okay,
so what is occurring right now? It&rsquo;s actually been going on for
quite a while, but it&rsquo;s just now, for whatever reason it&rsquo;s
leaked out -- or they have allowed it to leak out, I should say --
that there has been major military ship movement happening in the
Gulf of Aden in a specific location where there are actually hundreds
of ships right now circling a designated area of open water.
<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
talking Russian warships, Chinese warships, Japanese warships,
Australia, Germany, UK; the list goes on and on, even designated
European Union ships; UN ships; Blackwater, which is now Xe, has a
ship there right now.

<br><br>

If
anybody is aware, Japan has not actually had warships leave their
area of operation for military-type action in decades. Same with
China; China is very much about keeping their warships close. So this
is HUGE.

<br><br>

On
top of it, there is a research company that specifically deals in
genetics and DNA &ndash; I don&rsquo;t remember the name at this
time, but Kerry, when I get that information to you, you will have
that &ndash; that are specifically doing research in alien/ human
DNA, researching with the genetics. That is going on at the same time
there, as well.

<br><br>

On
top of it, there has been a lot of piracy going on there. Well, these
&ldquo;pirates&rdquo;, the Somali pirates and all that &ndash; it&rsquo;s
absolutely false flag operations. The reason they&rsquo;re doing that
is to gain fear of, you know, everyone in that area, to keep them
away. It&rsquo;s a very good manageable method to keep just regular
people, the public, away from that area. Because, you know, what&rsquo;s
a better way to invoke fear but piracy and terrorism?

<br><br>

That
comes to what happened at Fort Hood.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Before we go there, just to clarify&hellip; because as a
member of the Coast Guard, anything that happens on water is
obviously something that you&rsquo;re quite well versed in.
<br><br>

AM:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

KC:
 So we want to talk about the source of your information. And because
of that, we also want to talk about some of your, sort of, skills,
and augmented skills.
<br><br>

AM:
 Sure.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay, because this is going to factor in, I assume.
<br><br>

AM:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

KC:
 The other thing is that you&rsquo;re saying that there is genetic
engineering going on&hellip; What are you talking about? Are you
talking about on a ship in the middle of the water where the stargate
is located? Because I understand that the stargate is over the body
of water.
<br><br>

AM:
 It is. And there are actual&hellip; there&rsquo;s witness testimony
and there are images of&hellip; They&rsquo;re calling it an &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo;
and a huge magnetic field that is occurring right there at that
location. They&rsquo;re calling it an <I>anomaly</I>,
you know; they&rsquo;re giving it labels, where the water is actually
in a swirling motion; it&rsquo;s actually causing a huge whirlpool
effect.
<br><br>

KC:
 Incredible. Okay. Very cool.
<br><br>

AM:
 And there have been actual sightings, and you can find this online,
of where they have seen a part of it actually come up. But that&rsquo;s
gone away now, as far as the science because they have&hellip; I
mean, the area of the security zone around it is miles and miles and
miles.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. But who&rsquo;s in charge of that area?
<br><br>

AM:
 Well, it&rsquo;s... I&rsquo;m not quite sure, to be honest, of who
exactly is in charge. But I can tell you who I would be not surprised
if it&rsquo;s in charge is obviously members of the Global Elite, the
Powers That Be. What I think is who was in charge? Now, I think it&rsquo;s
going to change or may have already changed, but I have not yet been
able to get confirmation on it.
<br><br>

When
something like this occurs&hellip; Is this stargate something that
had not been discovered? Had it been put to rest and there was no
interest in it? These are possibilities, but when something like this
comes up, certain projects that are still very much happening under
the name of &ldquo;<I>Mark
Ultra</I>&rdquo;
come in and assume command, as per direction of certain members of
the Global Elite.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay, and when you say <I>Mark
Ultra</I>
you&rsquo;re actually saying <I>MK
Ultra</I>?
That it&rsquo;s a different designation? I don&rsquo;t understand.
<br><br>

AM:
 Well, <I>Mark</I>
&ndash; <I>MK</I>
&ndash; is actually used for designation of projects, things. That&rsquo;s
just me and my military talk. When you&rsquo;re in the military, it&rsquo;s
actually referred to as <I>Mark
Ultra.</I>
[Kerry laughs]<I>
</I>Like
you have certain flares that you use, like the <I>Mark
134</I>,
but you look at it and it says <I>MK
134</I>.


<br><br>

KC:
 I see.
<br><br>

AM:
 So that&rsquo;s just me being military, but I&rsquo;ll try to say <I>MK
Ultra</I>
for&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 No, no, no.
<br><br>

AM:
 I tend to start talking, using military lingo because I did it for
so long.
<br><br>

KC:
 I understand. Okay. And actually, let&rsquo;s talk about how old you
are and how long you spent in the military.
<br><br>

AM:
 I am 31 and I, by the books, spent just under ten years in the
military. But my involvement has gone on much longer, prior and
after.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Right. And again, to get back to the genetic engineering, you
said this is going on in the area. But is it, again, going on&hellip;
are you saying under the water?
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 In a base?
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 It is. There is an underwater base there. I have received
confirmation on that.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. You&rsquo;re saying that there is an underwater base in the
Gulf of Aden.
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. And that&rsquo;s where you think the genetic engineering is
going on.
<br><br>

AM:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. And can you&hellip;
<br><br>

AM:
 It&rsquo;s the same&hellip; They&rsquo;re doing similar things that
they&rsquo;ve been doing for decades at underground bases all over
the place. Specifically, they&rsquo;ve been doing specific types of
DNA research and engineering in a lot of the underwater bases, like
for example, the one that&rsquo;s in the Caribbean, the one that I
was at.
<br><br>

KC:
 Oh, right; the one that you&rsquo;re having recovered memories
about.
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Yes, very fascinating. You&rsquo;ve shown me some drawings
which are really very, very interesting.

<br><br>

What
is the source of your intel? Is it individual? Is it psychic? Is it
on the Internet? Is it&hellip; you know? I don&rsquo;t know.
<br><br>

AM:
 It&rsquo;s a little bit of everything and I&rsquo;ll tell you how
this all began.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 I had received an email from one of my sources, so I cannot disclose
this person&rsquo;s name at this time, for their safety, and there
was a link on it to an article talking about this &ldquo;<I>seagate</I>&rdquo;
that was being expected, that there was some strange anomalies
happening and there was a lot of warship movement.

<br><br>

And
so the investigative side of me decided to look into this. So I,
literally, in the past month spent 12 to 18 hours a day, not just
with my other research, but with checking this out, making phone
calls through some reliable contacts of mine. I started gathering
more and more information from separate sources.
<br><br>

Then
when I finally saw where it was happening, and then realized that now
the US, along with some other countries, have now all of a sudden
targeted Yemen because of Al Qaeda, which&hellip;

<br><br>

Al
Qeada&rsquo;s nothing but a network. That&rsquo;s it. Al Quaeda is
really just a network. It&rsquo;s not&hellip; it was all designed&hellip;
but that&rsquo;s a whole other story. &ldquo;Al Quaeda&rdquo; as a
name is used to invoke fear and gain compliance or needs of whatever
the Global Elite wants at that time.
<br><br>

Yemen
has now been picked because of what&rsquo;s happening now at the
stargate, which officially is being said that the stargate opened on
January 5th of this year.
<br><br>

The
other information, so I started making phone calls, then I started
getting more emails&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 Well, wait a minute. You&rsquo;re saying the stargate over the Gulf
of Aden opened on January 5th of 2010? Or 2009?
<br><br>

AM:
 What I know for fact is that it opened up on January 5th of this
year, 2010.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Now I&hellip; because I&rsquo;ve heard more information about
this. There is information out there saying that the stargate was
identified prior to that.
<br><br>

AM:
 Absolutely. Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.

<br><br>

AM:
 Yes. It&rsquo;s been going on&hellip; things really started getting
on the Internet and the news, really started a couple months ago.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 In December&hellip; I mean, it&rsquo;s now all over. I have a whole
file, which I will get to you, of tons of information, even stuff on
YouTube. And believe it or&hellip; The stuff on YouTube&hellip;
there&rsquo;s a lot of garbage on YouTube, but there&rsquo;s certain
videos on YouTube, if you YouTube &ldquo;Stargate Gulf of Aden,&rdquo;
you will see things that are absolute facts&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 &hellip;based on other people that have gathered information.
However, this stargate in the Gulf of Aden has been known for quite a
while and a lot of&hellip; certain countries want to gain&hellip;
want to have their hand in the cookie jar. And, you know, one country
wants to have more of a hand in the cookie jar than the other
country.

<br><br>

This
is why in 2008 I was approached by a Captain that worked for the
United States Marine Corp Intelligence. Out of the blue [he] come up
to me and said: <I>We
are wanting to recruit you for needs of service again.</I>
<br><br>

Now,
at this time, I was a mess. I was having a lot going on. I still, at
that point, thought I was really just crazy. I wasn&rsquo;t working.
I was, you know, living month-to-month, so &ndash; and that&rsquo;s
exactly how they want you &ndash; and so I volunteered to go back.

<br><br>

Yet,
after I volunteered to go back&hellip;there are parts that are foggy&hellip;
but I had met at Camp Pendleton with this Captain several other
gentlemen, who I am not quite sure who they worked for, but
obviously, high up the food chain in the government hierarchy, and
then two Generals.

<br><br>

One
General now is actually working on the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
charge of all Special Operations for the United States military.
<br><br>

KC:
 Are you able to name this person? Do you want to name this person or
not?
<br><br>

AM:
 [long, thoughtful pause]&hellip; I should probably wait to mention
that.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m afraid of mentioning it, but when we
do my more extensive interview I have already decided to release
certain names.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 But I want to just really focus on the Gulf of Aden and what&rsquo;s
going on there. But I will say that I will be mentioning his name.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 Just not yet. But this is the same General that I&rsquo;ve given you
copies of the emails?
<br><br>

KC:
 Yes.
<br><br>

AM:
 So that&rsquo;s who I&rsquo;m talking about.
<br><br>

KC:
 Uh-huh.
<br><br>

AM:
 And he told me that in North Africa, and it&rsquo;s still happening,
but even back in 2008 there was massive military movement &ndash; US
military movement in North Africa. They were gearing up for
something. That was one of the assignments that I was going to be
going to, to look over some operations there.

<br><br>

There
was also big movement happening in the area of the Suez Canal, which
is right in that location of the Gulf of Aden.

<br><br>

I
then started meeting top Black Op military personnel from all over
the world, a lot specifically from Australia &ndash; Australian SAS
[Special Air Service]. Several of these gentlemen were definitely
Australian, but were of Middle Eastern descent, who were being
trained to conduct false flag operations in the Middle East.
<br><br>

Shortly
after this happened, there were some false flag events that occurred,
the big one in Mumbai, which was absolutely orchestrated through our
country and the UK. That I was actually told first-hand information
by this General and some other people on his staff.

<br><br>

We
started developing a new team that I was placed in charge of. We
started out by doing a lot of States-side training operations with
[a] local police force. Specifically, the ground-breaking one was
with Twin Palms, which Twenty-nine Palms Marine Base is close by,
where the US Marine Corps was doing&hellip; This was where they
started doing the security check-points, which they now do a lot all
up and down California; a lot, you know, in southern California,
south of where we&rsquo;re at right now.
<br><br>

Why
am I explaining this? Here&rsquo;s why: The movements that are
happening right now from the military&hellip; There are actually a
few secret military bases in North Africa right now, and <I>in
Yemen</I>,
and other areas, where there are actually more US military personnel
than locals in the towns and villages in that area.
<br><br>

Why
are all these false flag operations happening? Okay, I&rsquo;m
getting to the very important point.

<br><br>

The
very important point is: these small false flag operations that have
been happening, the operations that I dealt with, with actually
conducting false flag operations, even having movement of <I>UN
vehicles</I>
here in California, which I witnessed. I saw caravans; I talked to
people.

<br><br>

Even
to the point where I was with a team walking around downtown Pasadena
just before New Years Eve because we had received intel &ndash; which
I later found out was false &ndash; but they told regular military
personnel and local police that a munitions train that was coming
from Barstow to Camp Pendleton, after a check in Barstow they
realised that 5,000 pounds of C-4 explosive was missing off the
train. Immediately high alert was put in; security checkpoints were
placed all over the place.

<br><br>

I
found out that this was not true. I started doing some of my own
digging into finding out why this was all going on.

<br><br>

Shortly
after that I was dropped from the project and I had to move out of my
apartment. My computer was yet again shut down. My cell phone had
fried. My place was broken into. When we went to do the police
reports, my roommate and I at the time, the police officer did not
fill out a police report. I had surveillance vehicles in front of my
place. I was&hellip; just&hellip; the heat was getting on. I actually
had to put my stuff in storage and stay on the couch with a friend of
mine.
<br><br>

KC:
 This was a year ago. Is that right?
<br><br>

AM:
 This occurred all in March of last year [2009], yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 Now, what does this all gear up to? This all gears up to, based on
my experience &ndash; and, yes, I guess you could say based on some
certain psychic ability that I have had; I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily
born with, but with things that I will get into in the interview, it
was brought out in me through techniques that they have, that Project
Talent has learned to really perfect.
<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
going to be a major false flag operation happening this year. I don&rsquo;t
exactly know when, but I know it&rsquo;s going to happen and there
are going to be&hellip; people are going to see a lot more military
personnel from other countries; the American police force; there&rsquo;s
going to be a lot more roadblocks, road checks.
<br><br>

KC:
 So you&rsquo;re saying a false flag operation here in America? Or
are you saying in the Gulf of Aden? Because somehow there&rsquo;s a
link-up.
<br><br>

AM:
 Both.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 And here&rsquo;s why. It&rsquo;s not just going to be the US. This
is going to be happening in certain countries where it needs to
happen. It&rsquo;s going to invoke a new war. They&rsquo;ve been
talking -- even Obama has spoken about this new war on Al Qaeda in
Yemen.
<br><br>

Why
do they do this? The same reason that they did it in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan was not a war against terrorism, it was a war to gain
more control in Afghanistan, because Afghanistan does have certain
entrances to deep underground facilities.
<br><br>

KC:
 Really.
<br><br>

AM:
 That&rsquo;s why Russia was after them for ten years.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay, so you&rsquo;re saying that it&rsquo;s not the poppy, the
opium trade that has people in Afghanistan&hellip; which is what I
think most people think.
<br><br>

AM:
 Absolutely not! No, it&rsquo;s not the opium. However, what a lot of
people don&rsquo;t know is that the CIA still &ndash; since Vietnam,
probably even before that &ndash; have always had Black

Operations
of trafficking drugs, which was what Air America was in Vietnam when
they were running operations in Cambodia and Laos.

<br><br>

KC:
 Right.
<br><br>

AM:
 So, yes, I mean, they got to make a profit, you know. War is not
just intent; war is profit. That&rsquo;s why we have, you know, the
bankers that are part of the Bilderberger group, and the Bohemian
Grove, and other societies -- Club of Rome, and whatnot.
<br><br>

This
false flag operation is going to invoke a new war on terrorism in
Yemen. It&rsquo;s going to happen. We&rsquo;re on the brink. There&rsquo;s
major military movement. There are military training camps being set
up in Yemen right now, by our government, that are training the Yemen
military to go after the terrorist movement there.
<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
even been said on the news, and you can find this online, that
they&rsquo;re making claims that Al-Qaeda has now built a larger base
in Yemen than exists in Afghanistan or Pakistan! Absolute garbage.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. So, as far as Yemen and the Gulf of Aden, how do these work
together? In other words, the countries bordering the Gulf of Aden...
is that why it&rsquo;s being targeted, specifically because the
stargate is over the water?
<br><br>

AM:<B>
 </B>Oh yes, absolutely. Yemen is ground
zero.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Let&rsquo;s talk about, if you know this or you have a theory,
on what&rsquo;s going on with that stargate. Do you have any idea?
<br><br>

AM:
 All I can give you now is theory, but I encourage everybody that&rsquo;s
going to see this to do your own research. Everything I tell you, do
your own research, because if you don&rsquo;t question, you don&rsquo;t
research -- you&rsquo;re not learning and you&rsquo;re not waking up.
<br><br>

Based
on my experience with a project that I was a part of that, again, we
will discuss in my full interview, I have two theories. Okay? One
theory is that there are extraterrestrial beings that no doubt are
opening, or just now really coming about doing something with this
stargate, for a definite purpose.
<br><br>

Now,
are these extraterrestrials friendly? Or are they unfriendly? It
could be two possibilities. I do not know yet, but I am working on
finding out through some very reliable contacts.
<br><br>

If
they are indeed friendly, then they have opened it up because we are
coming to a time in our world&hellip; You know, 2012 is not the end,
but I definitely believe that big things are going to be happening,
and we do have friendly extraterrestrials that want to see us really
become the world we&rsquo;re supposed to be. They&rsquo;re not going
to come in and rescue us, but they definitely do things to help
assist us move along.

<br><br>

Are
these the extraterrestrials that decided to open up the stargate? And
if they are, is the military and Global Elite going to do everything
they can to prevent this from happening, so that they can continue
their agenda, the agenda that they have been told they have to
accomplish within a certain allotted time or &ldquo;Certain Beings&rdquo;
are going to step in? That&rsquo;s absolute.

<br><br>

KC:
 That&rsquo;s the negative agenda that they&rsquo;re trying to roll
out. In other words, that certain negative beings,
negatively-oriented beings, in other words, service-to-self, are
going to step in if the Global Elite are unable to handle this
themselves? Is that what you&rsquo;re saying?

<br><br>

AM:
Absolutely.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Very interesting.
<br><br>

AM:
 But the other side of it is, does the stargate have... The
unfriendly extraterrestrials, are they running the show with the
stargate, and the military is there as, really, the servants? Because
that&rsquo;s really what the Global Elite are. <I>They&rsquo;re
not in power, people!</I> They are
serving <I>someone else, something else</I>,
or whatever you want to classify them as.

<br><br>

KC:
 What you&rsquo;re saying in terms of the Gulf of Aden, are you
saying that that stargate could be letting in, perhaps... In other
words, it could be incoming, it could be outgoing; it could be going
both ways.

<br><br>

AM:  It&rsquo;s
both.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. But the build-up militarily there will be not only to have to
control over this stargate on the one hand, but on the other hand to
make sure, like if it was a negative purpose, there could be negative
ETs coming through.
<br><br>

AM:
Absolutely.

<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 But, you know, with underwater bases, every single underwater base,
there is at least some presence of extraterrestrials there. But I
will tell you, none of them are friendly.
<br><br>

KC:
 [laughs] Right. If they&rsquo;re working with the military, I think
it&rsquo;s sort of a no-brainer, unfortunately.
<br><br>

AM:
 They&rsquo;re really running the show. But, see, they&rsquo;re
clever. They&rsquo;re able to calculate and do things in such a way
to where the Powers That Be think that they have control, but they
don&rsquo;t.
<br><br>

With
this specific underwater base off the coast in the Gulf of Aden, I
cannot say for fact who is absolutely running the show. All I can do
is give my theory based on my absolute direct experience with bases,
with being very high up in Black Projects, of Project Talent, knowing
of and actually assisting in some projects with Project Stargate, and
another project which I will be talking about &ndash; I&rsquo;ll just
go ahead and say it now: <I>Project
Seagate</I>.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Do you feel that what&rsquo;s going on in the Gulf of Aden...
are you saying it&rsquo;s <I>Adon</I>?
Do you know how to pronounce it actually?
<br><br>

AM:
 I believe it&rsquo;s <I>Aden</I>
[as in &ldquo;Ah-den&rdquo;], but I could be saying it wrong. If I
am, please excuse me, you know.
<br><br>

KC:
 Absolutely. But are you saying what&rsquo;s going on there may be
part of an operation which you know of as Project Seagate?
<br><br>

AM:
 No, I believe&hellip; Well, I don&rsquo;t want to speculate because
I don&rsquo;t like doing that. It&rsquo;s possible. But every [bit]
information that&rsquo;s been given to me, they&rsquo;ve labelled it
as a <I>stargate</I>.


<br><br>

However,
people have to be very careful because from my knowledge and from
things that I am starting to remember, as far as I know, there is
only one location for Project Seagate in the entire world. Could I be
wrong? Was there even information that even I wasn&rsquo;t privy to?
It&rsquo;s possible, but I doubt it.
<br><br>

KC:
 And that&rsquo;s about an underwater base that&rsquo;s located in a
Puerto Rico area?
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes. It&rsquo;s in the area of Puerto Rico.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay,
and that&rsquo;s the one you have recovered memories about.
<br><br>

AM:  Yes.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
Have you ever been to the Gulf of Aden?
<br><br>

AM:  Not
that I recall.
<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 If I have, I don&rsquo;t remember, but with all the information,
everything that I&rsquo;ve shared with you on the many times that
we&rsquo;ve talked and gotten together, I probably have maybe, if I
really sit down and think, I probably have regained maybe 40% of my
memories.
<br><br>

Why
this is happening with me at such a young age? I don&rsquo;t know,
because as you know from your experience with others, usually people
are much older [Former Super Soldiers usually start to regain their
memories in their &lsquo;50s and &lsquo;60s, not before]. But through
some other contacts I have been told... it&rsquo;s a little hard for
me to swallow, but I&rsquo;ve been told there is a very specific
reason why I specifically have been regaining these memories. And
it&rsquo;s not for a bad purpose; it&rsquo;s for a good purpose.

<br><br>

Unfortunately
there are times when I&rsquo;m still triggered and am taken elsewhere
to do things, as recently as just a couple months ago where I have
two days I cannot account for.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. So we&rsquo;ve got a stargate in the Gulf of Aden, we&rsquo;ve
got false flag operations, we just had one in which, whatever they
called it, the &ldquo;Underwear Bomber&rdquo;...
<br><br>

AM:  Yeah.
<br><br>

KC:
 ...in which he was basically let on a plane without a passport. Now,
is this part of that operation? Because it seems like it&rsquo;s the
opening act, in a certain sense.
<br><br>

AM:
 It is, because there has been recent information saying that not
only him, but the shooter at Fort Hood. Now all of a sudden, this
information&rsquo;s coming out that they both had connections with
terrorists, with Al-Qaeda <I>in Yemen</I>.


<br><br>

KC:  Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 And it&rsquo;s just popped up within the past week, if I remember
right. How convenient!
<br><br>

KC:
 So we have a major operation happening in Yemen right now. Is there
any other extenuating circumstance or any involvement, because you
said there&rsquo;re a lot of ships in that area? We&rsquo;ve got the
water sort of churning under some &ldquo;<I>electromagnetic
anomaly</I>&rdquo; going on.
<br><br>

AM:  Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 What&rsquo;s going on between the Powers That Be that you know of,
in terms of the ships? Are in you in touch with, for example, any
crew or military personnel in regard to any of that?
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes. I am. Several.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Do you want to talk about...?
<br><br>

AM:
 Even the Coast Guard... It&rsquo;s not just US Navy. There are US
Coast Guard ships, <I>&ldquo;</I><I>Cutters</I>&rdquo;
as they&rsquo;re called in the Coast
Guard that are there.

<br><br>

The
people that I&rsquo;m talking to that I worked with, I worked with on
the side of just being regular <I>Petty
Officer McCollum</I> in the Coast Guard,
so they are not fully aware, but they have contacted me and said:
<I>Aaron, something weird is going on,
and I can&rsquo;t quite place it, </I>and
they&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.

<br><br>

I
have a few other friends of mine that are actually in Coast Guard
Intelligence that have contacted me because they are aware of this
kind of campaign that I&rsquo;m doing, trying, you know... making
amends for what I was part of.
<br><br>

So
there is big movement there, absolute. The contacts that I&rsquo;ve
spoken to said that even they, when questioned about it, they&rsquo;re
told that it is strictly for enforcing the anti-piracy and to help
with escorting movements through the Suez Canal, because apparently
the Suez Canal is so &ldquo;<I>backed
up</I>&rdquo; with ship transports.

<br><br>

I
have never, ever head of there being a problem with &ldquo;<I>backed-up</I>&rdquo;
ships going through the Suez Canal -- never heard of that.
<br><br>

KC:
 So if they&rsquo;re going through the Suez Canal, where would they
be headed? There&rsquo;s got to be more than one destination for
those ships, right? In theory?
<br><br>

AM:  Yes,
absolutely.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. For example...?
<br><br>

AM:
 Well, I mean, the Suez Canal is a main shipping canal.
<br><br>

KC:
 So they could be just going through, bound for other areas, right?
<br><br>

AM:  Oh,
yes.
<br><br>

KC:  Not
just all headed for Yemen.
<br><br>

AM:
 No, no, not at all. Because if they did that, it would raise too
much suspicion, so what they do is they will indeed keep operations
normal.
<br><br>

KC:
 Uh-huh.
<br><br>

AM:
 Container ships, oil ships will still be allowed to go through it.
It&rsquo;s just, the reason they&rsquo;re able to do it so
well is because
the location of the Stargate in the Gulf of Aden is kind of in the
off-beaten path; it&rsquo;s not actually directly in the channel.
<br><br>

KC:
 Right, but you said that you have information, and I don&rsquo;t
know if this is public information, that there are ships from other
countries. I think you mentioned Japan and China and Russia.
<br><br>

AM:
 It is public information. There are European Union ships; NATO
ships; from Japan, Russia, Germany, the UK, United States, Australia;
and the list goes on and on.

<br><br>

And
yes, it is public information. They&rsquo;re talking about it right
now. It will be included... I have specific information that when I
give it to you so that you can look through it on your own, it&rsquo;s
absolute. This is out there.

<br><br>

Get
on your computer: Google&hellip; <I>Gulf
of Aden</I>; Google&hellip; <I>Gulf
of Aden Stargate</I>; Google&hellip; <I>War
on Yemen</I>. You Google any of those
things and you will get pages and pages of not just articles, but of
YouTube videos and other pieces of information.

<br><br>

People
need to look at this because with that, once you start digging, it&rsquo;s
amazing &ndash; not surprising to me &ndash; but it will be amazing
to people that they will see an article and it&rsquo;s directly tied
to the label of &ldquo;false flag war&rdquo;.

<br><br>

We
are going to be moving massive troops into Yemen. Yemen is the next
battleground, and it&rsquo;s going to happen this year. As far as my
knowledge and my intuition and everything else that I&rsquo;ve
gathered, it&rsquo;s going to happen this year.


<br><br>

If
it doesn&rsquo;t happen this year, and if I&rsquo;m wrong... good! I
<I>hope</I>
that my intuition&rsquo;s wrong, but unfortunately, my little gut
feeling that I get is 99% right, and sometimes I actually get angry
at myself when I&rsquo;m right about things, because I don&rsquo;t
want to see these things happen.

<br><br>

So,
if the year 2010 goes on and we don&rsquo;t go into a police state or
we don&rsquo;t have more false flags in the country, if this... what
I believe is going to be a terrible war happening in Yemen &ndash; if
that does not occur, then good. But everything that I&rsquo;ve
gathered, all my information, my contacts, have told me otherwise.
<br><br>

KC:
 Let me ask you this: I know you have some interesting abilities
associated with water. Isn&rsquo;t that right? And I remember that
dolphins have been used by the military to actually perform feats and
to actually do operations, basically...
<br><br>

AM:  Oh
yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 ...over by Saudi Arabia and over in that area. So I&rsquo;m thinking
that with what&rsquo;s going on in the Gulf of Aden, basically there
has to be something involving dolphins and possibly other sea
animals, like whales. But I&rsquo;m just curious, has there been any
information about the dolphins in that area or anything else?

<br><br>

AM:
 The only information that I have for fact, which is public
information, is that dolphins are being used in all the waters around
the Middle East for reconnaissance missions. They actually have
dolphins that&rsquo;re trained, that have actual surveillance
equipment that are attached to them for looking for underwater mines,
looking for bombs under piers, even under ships, oil rigs, and even
information-gathering.

<br><br>

They
have dolphins that are set up with certain information,
sound-recording equipment, that can actually record sound on land
that travels via, through the water because sound travels at a much
greater distance and can keep its real concentrated frequency much
longer underwater than it can in open air.
<br><br>

Do
I have any information that dolphins are specifically being used in
the Gulf of Aden for whatever attempted purposes with this Stargate?
No, I don&rsquo;t. But based on my direct work with dolphins, with
Project Seagate -- I would not be surprised.

<br><br>

Because
dolphins have been discovered, because of their frequencies, because
of other abilities that dolphins have that people are not aware of...
They discovered a while ago, however long &ndash; I know for at least
20, or maybe even 30 years &ndash; that dolphins directly have,
because of their frequencies, because of what they can do, are almost
used as a <I>medium</I>
for travel via the Seagate.

<br><br>

KC:
 What do you mean by that? Travel... are you talking about time
travel?
<br><br>

AM:
 I&rsquo;m talking about not just time travel; I&rsquo;m talking
about traveling to other locations in the universe.
<br><br>

KC:  How
are dolphins used in that regard?
<br><br>

AM:
 It was found that... Well, with the Seagate, everything is done...
frequencies are used to actually put you on a molecular level into a
different state. This way, your body can actually handle traveling
great distances.
<br><br>

KC:
 I know what you mean. You mean, in other words, if humans are put in
contact with dolphins and do what&rsquo;s called <I>entraining</I>...
<br><br>

AM:  Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 ...they get aligned on the same frequency as a dolphin, and that
heightens the human awareness, such that if you then... I&rsquo;m
extrapolating here because I&rsquo;ve swam with dolphins and I know
this happened to me; I&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s kind of what you
mean.
<br><br>

AM:
 You&rsquo;re absolutely... you&rsquo;re on the right track. Yes. One
of the things that they did that I was a part of was called &ldquo;psychic
echo-location.&rdquo;... [sighs] ... What&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m
looking for? This always happens when I start talking about this, I&rsquo;m
sorry. Sometimes my mind goes blank.
<br><br>

What
they discovered, it can&rsquo;t just be <I>any</I>
human. It has to be people that have received certain training,
mainly people that have some amount of psychic ability.

<br><br>

They&rsquo;ve
learned that they could put a person in with these dolphins and
actually it would cause deep molecular and psychic vibrations that
happen where the dolphin is almost used... <I>is
</I>used as a medium... and this person
becomes a conductor. They coexist in this way, so that it really
heightens the senses of the psyche of a person.
<br><br>

KC:
 Right. And so then what would happen? I guess we&rsquo;re kind of
going off into the area of speculation, although it occurs to me that
perhaps this is part of your buried memories.
<br><br>

AM:  This
is the thing, the subject that I, myself, had been working the most
intensely on.

<br><br>

The
whole thing with the Gulf of Aden just kind of fell into my lap
through the people I know. And then, taking it back to the false flag
operations that I helped orchestrate from July 2008 until the
beginning of March 2009; also meeting individuals that were Black Ops
that had been really in a way blackmailed to be in this country to do
false flag operations &ndash; specifically, military personnel from
other countries that were of Middle Eastern descent. They didn&rsquo;t
care if their family originally came from Iraq or Pakistan or India.
It didn&rsquo;t matter, as long as they had the training.
<br><br>

KC:
 And they looked the part, is the point.
<br><br>

AM:
 And they looked the part, yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. So you were involved in these so-called black false flag
operations. Can you describe a false flag operation that you were a
part of?
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes I can. Well, one of the false flag operations was where the
5,000 pounds of C-4 mysteriously
disappeared from a munitions train heading to Camp Pendleton. After
that, the Twin Palms Police Force started working with the Marine
Corps, and a bunch of military vehicles, specifically Humvees, from
their motor pool were being taken, but were not being signed out. But
then when certain individuals were even asked, even when I asked
about it: <I>Don&rsquo;t question us.</I>
You know?
<br><br>

Twin
Palms was doing random DUI checks. Now, if people know this, the
<I>military</I>
are not allowed to do in-country security check-points, DUI
check-points, anything involved with the police. That&rsquo;s what
the police are for.

<br><br>

When
that begins to happen, that is a pre-emptive strike to implement a
police state nationwide. Absolutely.

<br><br>

Then
there was even a bigger military presence that was happening, of all
places, in Pasadena. This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me because Pasadena
is really a trifecta of some <I>very</I>
<I>deep</I>
military operations: Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); Parsons
Corporation.

<br><br>

I
encourage the people who are going to see this, look into the history
of the Parsons Corporation of Pasadena, and you will be disgusted
with what they have been a part of, especially recently with putting
up certain kinds of &ldquo;hospitals&rdquo; in Iraq.
<br><br>

Then,
of course, I can really get into things like Jordan Maxwell and I
have talked about, as far as the OTO [Ordo Templi Orientis]. I mean,
the headquarters of the OTO in North America is in Pasadena, you
know.
<br><br>

<B>KC</B>:
 Sure, right.

<br><br>

AM:
 So where I live in Pasadena, I&rsquo;m surrounded by some very awful
things.
<br><br>

KC:
 So we&rsquo;re talking about a hotbed of the Illuminati, but we&rsquo;re
also talking about a military presence.
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes. In fact, specifically on... I want to say it was December 28,
if I&rsquo;m completely accurate... December 28, 2008, there was big
military movement that happened straight downtown Pasadena. Hundreds
of people witnessed it. It never made the news.

<br><br>

It
was a convoy of about 24 vehicles. We&rsquo;re talking Humvees,
armored personnel carriers, chemical trucks, tankers,
deuce-and-a-halves, which are the big, huge trucks you usually see
with the canopies over them [M35 2 &amp; &frac12;-ton cargo trucks].
They were all white. They were what I&rsquo;ve been a part of. They
were absolute UN vehicles.
<br><br>

KC:  Yes,
I was going to say that sounds like UN.
<br><br>

AM:
 But they didn&rsquo;t have UN marked on them. They didn&rsquo;t even
have license plates.
<br><br>

KC:  I
see.
<br><br>

AM:
 They moved through Pasadena and moved to a different location. On
that same day I was in Pasadena with a team of plain-clothed, not
just local police, but Marine Corps, armed, walking the streets in
communication with everybody else while this was happening. It was
not necessarily...

<br><br>

See,
a false flag operation, more often than not, is a terrorist attack
like 9/11.
<br><br>

KC:
 So what was going on with the white caravan was more of a
preparation? Is that the idea?
<br><br>

AM:
 It was false flag training operation...
<br><br>

KC:  I
see.
<br><br>

AM:
 ...in preparation for an actual false flag. You know, you have war
games; the military does war games. What are war games? War games are
training for actual war. Well, this is kind of a war game, but it&rsquo;s
a false flag game training operation, a drill.
<br><br>

KC:
 When we say <I>false flag</I>,
what we&rsquo;re talking about is something where a terrorist event
will happen where actually the terrorist is actually working for an
operation. It is an <I>op</I>,
and it is conducted by in essence the in-country personnel &ndash; in
other words, United States, the government, the agencies or the black
government, you know, the Black Secret Projects.
<br><br>

AM:
 Absolutely. Yes, that&rsquo;s the biggest thing that people need to
understand. When it&rsquo;s a false flag operation that happens
in-country, the people that are in charge of the Black Operations
that happen with that country, they&rsquo;re the ones who have
orchestrated it. The bombings that happened in the subways in England
&ndash; that was an England false flag operation. The bombings that
happened in Spain...

<br><br>

KC:
 Right. What about that?
<br><br>

AM:
 False flag, absolutely, because they all related to what? Taliban
and Al-Qaeda. What&rsquo;s truly Taliban and Al-Qaeda? It is a
<I>network</I>
to allow false flag operations to happen.

<br><br>

You
had mentioned about the people that are <I>used</I>,
that are aware of it. People have to understand that, more often than
not, the people that are <I>used</I>
have been mind-controlled. They have been taken, they have been
mind-controlled, and they&rsquo;re doing it because they are under
another <I>state of mind</I>.
<br><br>

The
one that happened on Christmas Day, he says that he had... All of a
sudden there was reports that he was almost in a trance when it
occurred and afterward and that he has no recollection.


KC:
 Who was? Who are you talking about?
<br><br>

AM:
 The gentleman, I don&rsquo;t remember his name, the actual person;
the &ldquo;Underwear Bomber&rdquo; is our label for it.

<br><br>

KC:  Okay,
yes.
<br><br>

AM:
 There were reports that he was in a trance. There&rsquo;s even a
person that has come out now, a husband and wife that were on the
plane.

<br><br>

KC:  Sure.
<br><br>

AM:
 They were on the news saying that they had contacted the FBI because
this tall, well-dressed, wealthy-looking man of Indian, you know, or
Pak... descent, had taken this kid, and actually they witnessed him
saying:<I> He doesn&rsquo;t have a
passport, but he&rsquo;s from</I>... I
think it was Nigeria... and he just said:<I>
We do this all the time there.</I> They
actually quoted him: <I>We do this all
the time there</I>. And they let him
through. Dumb!!
<br><br>

You
know, people need to be aware that that&rsquo;s happening and need to
question why.
<br><br>

KC:
 So you, yourself, you&rsquo;re saying over a year ago you saw
convoys and so on going on here in California, like a build-up of
military even here. Is that correct?
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes, absolutely. There&rsquo;s been a huge build-up of military in
southern California.

<br><br>

KC:  Do
you have any idea why?
<br><br>

AM:
 There&rsquo;re a lot of military bases in California. California is
very much a key region for military movement.

<br><br>

I,
myself, have been to two underground bases in California: one that&rsquo;s
in the San Diego area, and another one that&rsquo;s in the San
Francisco Bay, which is known as a Munitions Naval Weapons Base that
has a skeleton crew. Probably a lot of people don&rsquo;t know about
it. It is located in the San Francisco Bay area, and all you can see
from the water are three very large U-shaped piers where trainings go
on. There&rsquo;s a lot more to that base than what people see. I
mean, they have a HUGE facility under it. It&rsquo;s massive.

<br><br>

KC:  Have
you been there, or were you told about this?
<br><br>

AM:
 No, I&rsquo;ve been there. I was there. I was there in 2000, 2001,
and then in the first part of 2002, before I went to become part of
the project in the Caribbean.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. So... I guess what I want to do here is to just make sure that
we&rsquo;ve gotten the information that you wanted to get out there
specifically around the Gulf of Aden.
<br><br>

AM:
 Okay. So, just to clarify why I was coming out right now. You and I
spoke; this had to get out now because time is of the essence. False
flag operations are going to be happening more, not just in the
United States, but in other countries that are having direct
involvement with the Gulf of Aden and Yemen.

<br><br>

I
will not be surprised if we will see some more bombings or terrorist
attacks happen in places, like in Yemen itself. It&rsquo;s going to
happen in Yemen, because they need that to get the masses to support
what they&rsquo;re doing so that there isn&rsquo;t questioning.

<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
going to be more false flag operations happening here in this
country. It could be as small as more military check-points. Or they
could be as big as another actual attack attempt. It&rsquo;s going to
happen.
<br><br>

This
is all happening to build up <I>justification</I>,
like what happened with 9/11. They need this justification, so people
don&rsquo;t question, so you continue to be sheep, so that they can
finally go to war &ndash; the &ldquo;<I>new
war on terrorism</I>&rdquo;. Yemen is
ground zero for that.

<br><br>

Why is
this happening? It&rsquo;s happening because of this stargate that&rsquo;s
just off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden. Why are they doing
this? I&rsquo;ve given my two theories.



Why
is this happening? It&rsquo;s happening because of this Stargate
that&rsquo;s just off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden.

<br><br>

Why
are they doing this? I&rsquo;ve given my two theories: Theory one, we
have friendly extraterrestrials that have opened it for a reason.
What that reason is yet? I do not know.
<br><br>

But
this will not be the last; I&rsquo;m working on... You know, I&rsquo;m
not stopping after this. I&rsquo;m going to be digging very deep. I&rsquo;m
going to be continuing working on this, and as I get new information
you&rsquo;ll be getting the information, everything I get, Kerry.
<br><br>

Is
this friendly ETs that have opened it up for some reason? That could
be. And it could be that now we have, really, the major heavy-hitter
countries from all over the world, who have brought in <I>warships</I>
&ndash; not cargo ships, but <I>warships</I>
&ndash; by the masses that are literally in this giant circle that
have created this perimeter.

<br><br>

Why
is there scientific research there?

<br><br>

A
certain doctor who attempted suicide &ndash; oh yes! &ndash; that
worked directly for this research company said: <I>The
world needs to know!</I> And
all of a sudden unexplainably went crazy and tried to kill herself...
who worked for a company that the information has gotten out that are
doing research on combining alien and human DNA.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. So... now, I have to tell you that last night we had contact
with a whistleblower, and this is just one of those synchronicities
that goes on with Project Camelot. Today we&rsquo;re having this
interview with you, this was planned ahead, and last night
inadvertently we got in touch with a whistleblower who has worked for
the military &ndash; actually, Space Command &ndash; and were talking
about the Gulf of Aden.

<br><br>

I
didn&rsquo;t get all of the information, even though we talked for
like, six hours, and we will release that pretty soon, that
interview. He was talking about <I>synthetic
beings</I>, synthetic robots,
for all intents and purposes.

<br><br>

Project
Camelot was in touch with a secret source last night who was talking
about synthetic beings and basically, I guess, some form of
<I>biological robot</I>,
I guess, that are being created. And some which may be also coming
here, in other words.

<br><br>

So
I am wondering whether or not the Gulf of Aden is specifically
connected with a possible invasion of these <I>synthetic
beings</I>. Is there anything,
any hook-up that you know of, in this regard?
<br><br>

AM:
 There has been talk about it amongst me and some other people that I
am in direct contact with that were a part of multiple projects under
MK Ultra. That&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve discussed.

<br><br>

But
we weren&rsquo;t sure if we really wanted to go public with that just
yet, because, you know, what I&rsquo;m saying already, and what
people are going to say, is going to invoke fear. But fear can build
strength and using that fear... turn it around, to really find out
what&rsquo;s going on.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 It&rsquo;s something that we have talked about that indeed is being
used to bring in synthetic beings that were made off-planet.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 Now I&rsquo;m just curious. Now I&rsquo;ve got a question for you.
<br><br>

KC:
 Sure.
<br><br>

AM:
 I&rsquo;m going to turn around and ask you a question.

<br><br>

KC:
 [laughs]
<br><br>

AM:
 Your contact last night, when he was talking about these synthetic
beings that are being created on-planet? I&rsquo;m curious if he&rsquo;s
actually referring to the Omega Program?
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay, he didn&rsquo;t name that program. He simply was referring to
both aspects.

<br><br>

AM:
 Okay.
<br><br>

KC:
 In other words, the one which is that the military -- in China as
well as the US -- has been creating these beings and that there is
also... and it was really interesting, and obviously we&rsquo;re
going to be releasing the interview shortly.

<br><br>

But
he was talking about these beings that were created, in association,
&ldquo;on Atlantis&rdquo; who were then taken off-planet to another
planet and allowed &ldquo;to develop.&rdquo; Basically they developed
themselves. However, they&rsquo;re synthetic; for all intents and
purposes, they don&rsquo;t have a soul; and that they are now, for
some reason, returning to our planet, and that they are, let&rsquo;s
say, &ldquo;<I>not happ</I>y.&rdquo;


<br><br>

This
is the testimony from our witness, so it just dovetails in a very
interesting way. Now, this person was not able to say whether they
had arrived yet. I think that he was indicating that they had not.
But I&rsquo;d have to go back over the transcript to verify that.

<br><br>

AM:
 From the information that I&rsquo;ve been able to gather, my
intuition says that they are currently arriving because of the huge
electromagnetic anomaly that happened specifically on January 5th of
this year, 2010.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Are you talking about the blue spiral over Norway?
<br><br>

AM:
 There has been speculation that that blue spiral... and other
spirals have been showing up over Norway. Could that be related to
this? It could be. I don&rsquo;t have enough information to say yes
or no. I would not be surprised, though, if in some way it has direct
relation to it. I would not be surprised, but I don&rsquo;t want to
say absolute.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 I&rsquo;ll allow people to do their own research and I&rsquo;m going
to continue to do my research.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
interesting what you just mentioned about the <I>soul-less
beings</I> because the project
that I was mainly a part of, the project that I was, in reality, from
the time I was a child, was prepared for &ndash; and again, we&rsquo;ll
get into that on the next interview &ndash; Project Seagate.

<br><br>

Project
Seagate was a major project with a huge underground base location and
they were working on many different sub-projects. Project Seagate is
almost like a sub-version of MK Ultra.

<br><br>

Project
Seagate: one location that had many sub-projects, everything from the
human / dolphin / Super Soldier program, to an Omega Program where
they were making soul-less beings for remote viewing and actual, via
the Seagate, being able to put people &ndash; and yes, this is real
people &ndash; their astral self, their energy, their soul, into one
of these robots for covert operations, so that if the body gets
killed, they are able to extract and put it in.

<br><br>

I
have people that I know that this has happened to, and we have
absolute evidence of this happening.
<br><br>

KC:
 So this is a lot like <I>Avatar</I>,
basically. You&rsquo;re talking about&hellip;
<br><br>

AM:
 I am talking about&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 &hellip;military personnel, that basically they&rsquo;re going in
and &ldquo;inhabiting&rdquo; these robotic beings.
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.

<br><br>

AM:
 And also they found that it was easier to have this for traveling,
for operations, through the Seagate.
<br><br>

KC:
 Off-planet.
<br><br>

AM:
 Off-planet. My specific role, which I don&rsquo;t want to get into
right now because, you know, it&rsquo;s very complicated, but I will
say that my involvement with Project Seagate was very high up, very
in depth, and I&rsquo;ve been to some interesting locations.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Do you think that you yourself were doing some of this, you
know, having your &ldquo;essence&rdquo;, in essence, go into one of
these robotic beings and travel? Or is your experience different than
that?
<br><br>

AM:
 I worked with people that did that&hellip;
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 &hellip;but because of my specific training... As far as alterations
that were done to my body, even as a young child, some memories are
coming back that even my parents have no recollection of. I was able
to physically be relocated because of what was done to me. And
there&rsquo;s another person that you&rsquo;re in contact with who is
able to do the same thing, actually was a person I worked with
closely that was there.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 And this person... when the time comes, this person will be talking
to you. Someone you already talked to will be speaking of the Project
Seagate as well.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. And you have some unique abilities in terms of water. Is there
a thought that you yourself were, I don&rsquo;t know, your DNA was
combined with, for example, a dolphin? Is that possible?
<br><br>

AM:
 I&rsquo;m learning new things about myself almost every day. With
me, anything is really possible because I&rsquo;ve been told some
things by reliable sources that have completely blown me away. In
fact, I&rsquo;m still having a hard time... I mean, I accept it. I
know it&rsquo;s true. But it&rsquo;s very hard to deal with because,
I mean, my body has been through a living hell.

<br><br>

I
had some questionable experimentations that were done to me as a
child that I absolutely remember. Well, I&rsquo;ll just say this, the
reason why I was&hellip;

<br><br>

Everything
began for me from the time I was three years old. I have an absolute
memory that I&rsquo;ve been able to get confirmed from family, where
I was taken to a facility by a certain relative &ndash; I will
mention that when I do my full interview &ndash; who I do not have
contact with, was not allowed to have contact with.

<br><br>

When
I was three years old, I was thrown into a pool and they induced me
to drown. I remember laying, then, on a slab next to this pool,
throwing up and coughing up water and then seeing these men around
saying: <I>We have one.</I>


<br><br>

I
remember hearing that. This is not a dream, this is not fantasy, this
is absolute. I sometimes still wake up with having night terrors and
flashbacks about this.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
always been able to hold my breath for a long time without having to
do the hyperventilating. I&rsquo;ve always had a very interesting
relationship with water. I have several people that you know, that
can absolutely, with complete honesty, tell you of accounts that
they&rsquo;ve witnessed of things that have happened to me with
water.
<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
been told not to do any kind of soaking in water, because of
something which I will reveal in the next interview, which could
happen.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. So, rather than go down that road, since this interview is
about another matter...
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 ...let&rsquo;s go back to the Gulf of Aden and talk about the false
flag subject in terms of what specifically, if anything, has been
left out of this interview so far. Because I think we could wrap this
up, as it is.

<br><br>

AM:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 I can&rsquo;t think of any particular areas that we might not have
covered, but then, maybe something might have occurred to you. So I
want to make sure that we&rsquo;ve covered this topic, that you&rsquo;ve
gotten out the word about what you think is coming in regard to the
build-up of the military there. Any other random thoughts or
information, pieces of information that you might have that would be
pertinent for the public to be aware of here?
<br><br>

AM:
 Don&rsquo;t travel to the Middle East this year. <I>Do
not travel there</I>. Do not go
there because they do not care about &ldquo;collateral damage&rdquo;.
They proved that with 9/11. They proved that with the Oklahoma
bombing. They proved that on December 25th. They proved that at Fort
Hood.

<br><br>

<I>They
do not care.</I> You are an
expendable piece of property to the Global Elite, to Mark Ultra, to
governments all around the world.

<br><br>

I
have just a really deep, sinking [and] dark feeling that there&rsquo;s
going to be a lot of death. I&rsquo;ve been seeing death. I&rsquo;ve
been having visions of some really horrible scenarios that could
definitely&hellip; are possible. Not just in the Middle East,
specifically Yemen, but in-country.

<br><br>

Do
your research. Everything that I have said in this interview and that
Kerry has said... please... You know, what I&rsquo;m telling you is
absolute and I&rsquo;ve also specified what was theory, what was my
intuition, and I&rsquo;ve even labelled some sources where I gathered
information.

<br><br>

Everybody
that sees this interview, I encourage you to do the same. Don&rsquo;t
just take my word for it &ndash; because if you just take my word for
it, you&rsquo;re doing the same as watching TV or watching the movies
and taking their word for it.

<br><br>

You
need to do the research on your own because that will allow you to
open your mind and really give yourself empowerment.

<br><br>

The
greatest gift humanity was ever given was free will, and as long as
you allow your free will to keep working, you will open up to what&rsquo;s
occurring.

<br><br>

False
flags are going to be happening more, based on my intuition and my
intelligence that I have gathered. Something else big is going to
happen in the United States and it&rsquo;s all being done to invoke
this &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo; in Yemen, for movement with this
seagate.



Is
it going to be to help escort these beings from off-planet? Or are
these friendly beings that are trying to do something?

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
already in a galactic war that&rsquo;s happening now. Believe it or
not, it&rsquo;s happening. But with that war, there are many
different battles occurring and we are on the brink of a new battle.
This is definite; I have no doubt about that. This is going to be
another battle of the galactic war.
<br><br>

And
what people need to realize is that this planet is a war prize. It
always has been. There&rsquo;s always been conflict for this planet,
and there are many reasons which I could get into, but God, you know,
I would go and on and on.

<br><br>

Is
there any other information that I can think of that people need to
know about? Not at this time. Just know, specifically, you will find
that the major countries that have warships... And I want to
emphasize: these are <I>warships,</I>
everybody &ndash; the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Japan, Germany,
NATO, the UN, and the now mercenary group Xe, which is more commonly
known as Blackwater. There are scientific research corporations there
right now under multi-national contract doing heavy research on
alien/ human DNA.

<br><br>

Ask
yourself: <I>Why?</I>
Ask yourself why was there a doctor that worked for this company that
unexplainably said: <I>The
Earth, the people of the world have to be notified.</I>
It&rsquo;s quoted in an article I found &ndash; and attempted
&ldquo;suicide&rdquo; because she knew something. She was part of
something. She had her own self-awakening and the information she has
was so great, so overwhelming, that she tried to kill herself. But
did she really try to kill herself? Or was this a mind-controlled,
you know, attempt to kill herself?

<br><br>

Three
of the people that I was in contact with, that I working with, what I
myself was helping orchestrate &ndash; false flag events in 2008, and
in the beginning of 2009 &ndash; unexpectedly disappeared when they
themselves became more self-aware and realized what they were doing
was wrong.

<br><br>

I
have emails from certain personnel that contacted me and said that
they were under house arrest in Twenty Nine Palms. Right after this &ndash;
and I need to say this because this shows the level of seriousness
that this is at &ndash; the person that I was in contact with,
Captain
Scott Syner/Signer [name unclear]
I will say his name because he has disappeared.

<br><br>

The
place that he lived at, which was not too far from where I was
living... I went to where he was living because had I lost
communication. He had given me a document that actually talks about
the preparation, a document that was drafted in, I believe in 2000,
for the agenda going all the way up to 2015 &ndash; a document was
never supposed to leave the hands of certain personnel.

<br><br>

I
have 22 pages of that document that I have shared with you, Kerry.
This will... I&rsquo;m getting off track. This person, Scott
&ldquo;Syner/Signer&rdquo;, Captain Scott &ldquo;Syner/Signer&rdquo;
who had given me this information, started realizing things were
wrong, up and disappeared.

<br><br>

Where
he lived, I went and talked with the manager. They had no... They
would not tell me. <I>Oh we had
no </I><I>Scott
&ldquo;Syner/Signer&rdquo;</I><I>
living here</I>. His phone
became disconnected. The people that I was in contact with were
disappearing left and right.

<br><br>

I
myself became under heavy surveillance, even had an attempt on my
life. Yes, that did happen last year, where on one occasion where I
first thought it was an accident until I got more information. Well,
it was not necessarily an attempt on my life, but it was what they do
a lot, which they&rsquo;re doing with a lot of people I&rsquo;m in
contact with. It was a scare tactic. They&rsquo;re trying to shut me
up.

<br><br>

I
just got absolute confirmation &ndash; and I&rsquo;d like to
emphasize on that, absolute confirmation, because that&rsquo;s what I
have to have before I will really say in definite... The conference
that unfortunately is having so many complications, the MK Ultra Mind
Control Conference, I received an anonymous tip, and then through
contacts of mine, saying that there was going to be &ldquo;an
attempt&rdquo; on me at the conference because they know that I&rsquo;m
getting ready to whistleblow the project that is the absolute most
secret-kept undercover project in the world. That is Project Seagate.


<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. So thank you very much, Aaron McCollum, and I assume that you
want this video to go out as-is?
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes.
<br><br>

KC:
 In other words, we can talk about making it only audio; we can talk
about possibly putting it into just a transcript, a written
transcript, if you at a later date you decide to do so. But at this
moment, is it your feeling that you want this to go on the Internet
as-is?
<br><br>

AM:
 If I am going to really give... come out as a credible witness... I
think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re really calling them now, not
whistleblower; you&rsquo;re using the term <I>witness</I>?
<br><br>

KC:
 Both.
<br><br>

AM:
 Okay. If I&rsquo;m going to be an actual... because this interview
is going to be followed up with the full interview of how I came to
be, who I am now and my whole history of the training I got as a kid.
We&rsquo;ll be blowing something wide open that you and I have talked
about. If I&rsquo;m going to have credibility, if I&rsquo;m going to
have people really see me, they need to see me as a person. They need
to know.

<br><br>

And
yes, you know, I have the tattoos and the earrings, but there&rsquo;s
a reason, which I&rsquo;ll be explaining why I look the way I do now.
But if I&rsquo;m going to be a legitimate, real person... and also
because there are people that I&rsquo;m in contact with that I
notified I was going to be doing this, and you and I talked about
it... to see my face, to see that yes I am real, I am not some man
behind the Iron Curtain, I&rsquo;m not some &ldquo;Deep Throat&rdquo;
in a parking garage. They need to see it as a whole.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 They need to see my face. For me, eye contact, seeing the person, is
very much, you know, a lot more empowering.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AM:
 You know, my life has already been threatened, and attempts have
been made. I have scars from knife wounds, from almost getting
killed. But, being who I am, I lack the emotion of fear. I&rsquo;m
not afraid and I need to do this.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Thank you very much. I also, just as a <I>caveat</I>,
want to say here that isn&rsquo;t it true that your connection with
Camelot and specifically with Duncan O&rsquo;Finioan has been
instrumental in you getting in touch with some of this?
<br><br>

AM:
 Yes. When a friend of mine first introduced me to Project Camelot, I
was very interested because I was starting to have some memories come
back. And then this friend of mine showed me the Duncan O&rsquo;Finioan
and the Dave Corso interview and it took everything not to break down
and cry because... <I>something</I>...
there was something I couldn&rsquo;t remember.

<br><br>

When
I saw Duncan and I saw Dave, there was something inside that was just
<I>feeding</I>
me and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what. And then when Duncan and
Dave mentioned St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands, my head literally
hurt. It was like I was walking in this hallway and all these doors
opened.

<br><br>

And
I can tell you and I will be saying this in my interview, that Duncan
and Dave have memory lapses of what happened in St. Thomas. I will be
able to tell you, and I&rsquo;ve talked to Duncan and Dave about
this, what happened.

<br><br>

Yes,
Dave and Duncan and I did in fact do operations together. We have
confirmed it. We know it, and even another soon-to-be-whistleblower
was directly involved with Project Seagate with me.

<br><br>

Me
contacting you, saying this, is not a coincidence &ndash; there&rsquo;s
no such thing as a coincidence. This was all the way it was supposed
to be. I owe a big &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to you for bringing me to
the conference, and it was really a reunion between Duncan, Dave, and
the other friend, who I promised I wouldn&rsquo;t say this person&rsquo;s
name. I&rsquo;ll leave that up to this person.

<br><br>

KC:
 Yeah. I wanted to make sure that we gave kind of a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;
or a nod of the head to Duncan O&rsquo;Finioan and Dave Corso.

<br><br>

AM:
 Yes, absolutely. And you know, Dave and I, we see each other all the
time. I&rsquo;ve been regularly going to his place. Duncan&rsquo;s
been really busy, but there were a couple times after the conference
when I was able to speak with him and actually see him when he was in
LA filming <I>The Manchurian
Candidate</I>.

<br><br>

By
the way, I want to pitch that, [Kerry laughs] if you haven&rsquo;t
seen what&rsquo;s titled as <I>The
Manchurian Candidate</I>
episode of <I>Conspiracy Theory
with Jesse Ventura</I>. It&rsquo;s
on TruTV. You can find it on YouTube now &ndash; an absolute must. It
was so well done. I was so impressed with how well it was done.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
my little pitch for that, just helping out my friends Dave and Duncan
who are also working hard to get the word out.

<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Thank you very much. Today is January 9th, 2010.

<br><br>

AM:
 Yes it is. It&rsquo;s Dave Corso&rsquo;s birthday today.

<br><br>

KC:
 There you go.
<br><br>

AM:
 I sent him a birthday card.

<br><br>

KC:
 [laughs] Okay, thank you very much.
<br><br>

AM:
 Thank you.
