I'm the author of the <a href="https://serpo.org" target="_blank">serpo.org</a> website, which went      online in the middle of November, 2005. And one of the features of the      website was a contact form in which I encouraged visitors to the website      to contact me with any information, comments, thoughts, questions that      they might want to have. And of course my original intention was to encourage      a dialogue about Serpo itself. But right from the start I was aware of      the possibility that people might get in touch to talk about anything else,    which of course I welcomed.</font><img src="mr_x.jpg" alt="Mr X and Bill Ryan" width="450" height="295" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And      one such here is the man that I'm talking to. It&rsquo;s a very great      pleasure. I'm not going to identify him, for obvious reasons. And he has      a very interesting story to tell about his personal interaction with relics      and documents and artifacts and films from a whole series of alien encounters,      starting off with Roswell in 1947. And it became very clear that after      this man contacted me just saying he had an interesting story to tell,      and he told me one or two little details about that, I picked up that ball,      recognizing there was something here of some considerable importance. It's      got nothing to do with the Serpo story but it should be something that's      of considerable interest to every serious student of Ufology.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(To Mr. X) And I wonder if I could just ask you to summarize your story      just in a couple of sentences, just so the viewers here will get an idea      of why it was that I immediately seized on what you had to say and saw      that it was important.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr.      X: (voice electronically disguised) Well, I had... my original contact      had been that I had seen nothing in my experience that had to do with the      Serpo story but that I had other information. And basically what that information      was that I had spent six months at an aerospace company &hellip; I am      not a military person. I never was a military person... I spent six      months archiving and filing artifacts, videos, films, pictures and documents      having to do with the government's involvement in UFO projects, research,      and that sort of stuff.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill: And this was in which year? In the 1980s?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yeah, &lsquo;84, &lsquo;85.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: All right. And what did your job exactly entail? And what kind of material      did you find yourself holding in your hands during that time?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Well, I was pretty much a file clerk with a security clearance [chuckles]      and I was brought items each day. And sometimes they were to be divided      up into different branches of service; sometimes they were to be divided      up into classifications. Sometimes they were to be divided up as to what      the content was inside them. Most of them were sealed. There were artifacts      from crashed ships, there were disks from crashed ships. They were mostly      pictures and documents from the US government, and all branches of the      government, and also from aerospace companies.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kerry Cassidy:        Can you tell us what kinds of stamps these documents contained?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Stamps?        Classification stamps? &quot;Top secret&quot;. &quot;Secret.      Eyes only.&quot; Secret code words. A lot of them were only to be opened      by authorized personnel. I mean, I worked in documentation so I knew the      markings on documents and I knew what I should have been able to see in      my regular line of work and, you know, things that were marked incorrectly      I had to mark up and correct. So I was involved in that sort of stuff in      my work. A lot of them were military that were not marked with any classification      whatsoever, which to me was kind of odd, but that's the way part of them      were, just sealed envelopes with no marking whatsoever.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What caught your eye the first time you came across this information,      that actually sort of turned your head?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Ah, well, it's something that I had believed in for quite a long time      and to be able to actually see proof, to me, was probably one of the best      things that has ever happened to me. That's the way I felt about it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: I can really        imagine that. And, since you started to come out with this information,        one or two people have called you &quot;Roswell Man&quot;.      Is this just because of, I mean, was this material just from the Roswell      crash or was it from other, let's say, interactions and time periods also?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Oh yeah, it was material for the back up, request for, and governing      of, knowledge to do with, dealing with, extraterrestrials and vehicle crashes      and recoveries and equipment recoveries. That sort of stuff. All kinds      of stuff.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: So in fact there was a whole cross-section of government/alien interaction      between 1947 and...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: ...the        present date.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Wow. OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Now you mentioned that you noticed there were a number of crashes and      you actually told us the number. Can you tell me, what was that number      of crashes that has happened over the years?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Over fifty.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: On American soil?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: America and abroad.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Any idea of the number of different alien species that were involved      in these crashes?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: No. I can't remember, I can't recall, but I do remember coming across      at least five different types. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And did you see photographs of these beings?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Four of them. Four different kinds.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Photographs of four different beings.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And could you describe them?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Well, there was... my favorite was always the tall orange ones which,      in documentation, it was stated that they were the creators of what we      call Grays, the kind of common gray alien with kind of a pointed chin.      The orange ones were taller, thinner, had a more round face but still had      the large eyes. Those were the two most prevalent. There was also another      race that were almost like the Grays but were maybe a little bit more pale      and a little bit more stocky, but the same type of size, almost cousins      to Grays. Almost. And then there was talk and pictures of beings that look      just like you and I, only they had white skin. Sort of like Mr. Ryan here,      with the blue eyes. Lighter hair, though. Those were the ones that, from      what I've been reading on the internet... I had never read documentation      of this... that offered to save us if we disarmed our nuclear weapons      and that sort of thing.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: But you never saw it in documentation.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: No I did not.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: So, all right.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Was there documentation about the purpose behind the visits, the visitors?      In other words, why they were here?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yes, there was. It had to do with them fearing our nuclear capabilities      and of both destroying ourselves and maybe other species out in space because      we were getting awful close to space travel at that point.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And was this a hypothesis from the government or something that you      read in the documentation or something as definitive as that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: This was definitively known through contact.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Did they explain how they communicated?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: They were telepaths.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Telepathic?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Did they reference remote viewing or, you know, how the humans were      conducting that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Correct. In being-to-human, telepathically, they would sit there, across,      like you and I are sitting and I'd just have to look at you and you'd know      what I want. We'd be communicating through our minds. That sort of stuff.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Did you have any kind of, any sense of, how many of those beings were,      let's say, active guests of the American government in such a way that      communication like that was possible? Was it just one or two?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Five to ten, as far as my knowledge. I think, in my opinion there was      way more.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: The documentation reflected five to ten?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Looking at documents, was evidence of five to ten.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: What else did these aliens reveal about themselves in this ongoing      dialogue with the American government?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: That we are descendents of them. That we were actually put here on      earth from their genetic material. That we are genetically engineered and      put here and that we were one of their life breeds. That was one major      thing that I read. Also, they also claim that they were the ones that were      responsible for putting Jesus Christ on this earth to teach us spirituality      and to get us to evolve past the greed and what the Bible calls sin. I      just, I really don't know what it is. I just know that the human condition      causes us to want to preserve ourselves. It causes greed and life survival      skills and that sort of stuff.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And was that specifically mentioned in the documentation?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: It was alluded to. I couldn't say that it was specifically spelled      out that way, but it was alluded to.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What was alluded to?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: The teaching of humankind to evolve to a higher plane, to where we      would realize that we're all one species and we're of the same material,      both energy and physical. And there's no need to fight wars with one another      and there's no need to have currency... that sort of earthly stuff that      we kind of pride ourselves on and get our identity from? Because according      to them, they don't have that. They don't see their bodies like we see      ours. It's not a possession to them, it's a vehicle.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Did you see any pictures?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Logical        entities, ships, mostly flying ships, and a lot of them from far away        but some did report some sightings that were labeled &quot;hollow&quot;.      A lot of Space Shuttle missions.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Photographs?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yes, there were photographs, black and white for any older photographs.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Are there any particular photographs that come to mind that really      stuck in your mind?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: What I        said in the other interview that I conducted was what struck me the most        at first was that I saw pictures and this was labeled &quot;Hawaii&quot;.      It was from a typewriter, so they were pretty old pictures, they were black      and white, of a ship entering or and/or going into the water but I could      see no splash.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: OK. Of a craft?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: A saucer-shaped craft and all I could see of it was light. And it wasn't      blurry, though. It was a pretty good photograph.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: From what kind of range?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Five or six hundred yards, maybe a quarter of a mile away.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: So on an 8 x 10, the disc was like two inches, two and a half inches.      It was a pretty good shot. When I saw them, because I had never thought      about that aspect of extraterrestrials, that they would even think to enter      the water, or... Later on, thinking about it, it was like maybe that's      where they came out of.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: So water's just another fluid.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Just more dense than air.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Getting back to the aliens themselves.... was there any documentation      about where these guys came from?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Documentation I saw jibed with the Serpo story about Zeta Reticuli.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Zeta Reticuli. All right. And no mention of any other star system or      source?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: OK. And was there anything there that could be interpreted as being      threatening to the human race or to individuals? For instance was there      anything there about abductions or about complicity with any kind of control      scenario over the populations?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Nothing whatsoever.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What about alien technology? Was there any indication that we were      getting, you know, technological...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: There was documentation on receiving items but not giving any manuals,      that sort of stuff. Like here it is, look at it and check it out and this      is what it does and here it is.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: OK. Any        recollection there about &hellip; in what realm that technology,      anything... are we talking about &hellip;</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: I remember power source, but more communication.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: What do you remember about that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Nothing about weaponry. We were supplied no weapons.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: What do you recall about the communication devices?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Not a lot. Just that there were just people trying to figure out how      the things worked, not any indication about what it did or how far it reached.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: What did you learn about the... at the risk of using the word in the      incorrect context... the spiritual context of these aliens? Did you learn      anything about the way that they related to, whether they had a spiritual      soul as opposed to just...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Definitely they communicated to us that they were spiritual like we      were, so they likened us to them or them to us in whatever context. And      then they talked about recycling their bodies and not looking at their      bodies as a possession. They looked at their bodies as a transportation      device to get their soul from one place to another or to house their soul.      It wasn't a sacred possession like it is here on earth with humanity.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: It's like they're the driver of a car, and then when the car got...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yeah, I would liken it to the driver of a car, but everybody has exactly      the same car and there's an endless supply of them. You don't have to pay      for it, you don't own it, it's not special, it's just there.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: What would happen to these guys when their bodies die?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: They didn't lose their memories? Is that right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: They didn't have death like we did. They did not forget. They knew      before their body was going to die and they just went ahead and got a new      one and their body pretty much was gone after they left. So it continued      for them and they lived anywhere from 200 to 400 years.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Two to 400 years would be the duration of one life?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: That's how it was worded according to our representatives here.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: What about names of military or presidents at the time of the documentation?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: I remember reading Truman and Eisenhower but no other.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So Truman and Eisenhower did know.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: I saw evidence that they did know. I think that most presidents, if      not all, from then on, do know. I don't know how much access they have      but I think they know.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Was there anything that you read at that time in the 1980s that pertained      to what then was in the future?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yes. There was talk about them, what was described as a mass landing,      in 2012 at the end of the year.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: At the end of 2012?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: A mass landing.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And that was a date that you read in the documentation?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And was        that going to be something that the aliens were telling the Americans      was going to happen? Or was it &hellip;</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Well, they were telling them it was going to happen regardless of whether      they wanted it to or not.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And was there a reason why they were choosing that year?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: For a long time, I just think there were a lot of civilizations that      were on this planet, maybe still are, but some that were and are not any      more, that knew of that day and why it was so important.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: So there's    a sense of an inevitable future &hellip;</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B... that will be approaching.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And this is documented. And right now we're not very many years away      from there.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: No, we're not. [chuckles]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: How does that make you think and feel, given the experiences that you've      had?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: I welcome        it because I don't think there's any, ah... any animosity toward us.        I don't think &hellip; I        think what's going to be more disturbing is how the government handles      it, and how it handles citizens that maybe want to know more.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Do you have any observations or thoughts about how it's being handled      at the moment?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yeah. Very poorly.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Very poorly. So if you were in charge of the disclosure operation how      would you do this?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: If I had        to start now that's a tough job. I think it would have been started a        long time ago. I think that I would have started at Roswell and not pulled        that newspaper article and not pulled that report from the radio. I would        have let it continue. And I would have welcomed those qualified, you        know, scientists and stuff, to come in and talk about this, so that we        could, you know, do observation at first until there was more communication,      that we had discovered beings and recovered beings that were alive &hellip; because      there's several crashes where they were all mutilated and dead.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And of the beings that didn't survive, there were autopsies?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You actually saw some autopsy reports?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Yes, I did.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: Do you remember what you read in those autopsy reports about their      physiology and biology?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: All I remember reading about is their blood being chlorophyll-based      and them not eating, ingesting, as we do. They don't have stomachs, don't      have waste material like we do in our traditional human. They're like a      cross between like a plant and an animal and they gather their energy through      absorbing minerals through their skin. And they use light for photosynthesis.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: I was curious what your own personal experiences have been. Have you      ever had any, let's say visitations, since you left the job, be they Men      in Black and/or alien visitations?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: Never seen        a UFO in my life. I'm waiting! No sightings, no MIBs, no nothing. Well,        I've never done any of this before &hellip; so &hellip; other      than in the last two or three months talking with Mr. Ryan here.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: All right. Well, thank you very much for being so honest and coming      forward so amazingly forthrightly and we hope to hear more from you.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B: And this is a real service. You're a brave man. Thank you.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">X: You're welcome.</font></p>    <p><font color="#FF9900" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="left"><strong>_____________________________</strong></font></blockquote></blockquote><div align="center">     <div align="center"><br><table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                          <!--DWLayoutTable-->                          <tr>                            <td width="350">                          <div align="center">                                  <table width="425" border="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                                    <tr>                                      <td bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>                                          <font color="#990033">Support Project Camelot - make a donation:</font></strong></em></font></p>                                    <div align="center"><a href="https://projectcamelotportal.com/donate.html"><img src="x-click-but21.gif" width="110" height="23" alt="Donate"></a>
