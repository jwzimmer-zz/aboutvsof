very interesting website, I&rsquo;ve              got to say.

And then talk about some of those                  things that you&rsquo;re seeing long range as well.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clif High:&nbsp; Okay. You guide. It&rsquo;s                  entirely your forum here so you ask, I shall reply.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. To start out with, I guess the most interesting                  way to start would be to explain a little bit about the technique                  you&rsquo;ve got going on here.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; OK, I&rsquo;ll give you the basic spiel on the thing                  and we&rsquo;ll go from there. And in 1994 I came across this                  idea that I called &ldquo;The Language Model for Storing Data&rdquo; while                  working for some of the high-tech&hellip; well, the largest                  software companies on the planet. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And finally over time I wrote some software to support the                  idea, in an attempt to mine the internet for emotions around                  the idea of stocks and bonds, with the idea that, if I knew                  how people felt about them, I could <em>predict</em> what their                  reaction would be to developing news, ahead of their being                  able to make that actual reaction themselves&hellip;with the                  idea that this could be sold as a profit-making kind of a venture. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in                    1997 I came across something that totally flipped my mind                    about this whole idea, in the sense that I went looking for                    Stanford University Network, a stock at the time, and came                  across &ldquo;suns&rdquo; because&hellip; in terms of the fuller                  energy source we&rsquo;ve got for us&hellip; and noticed that                  there were some really interesting things going on in the language                  I was picking up.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From there                    I&hellip; From 1997 to 2001 I deduced some of the                  following principals: All people are psychic. Most don&rsquo;t                  know it. Even if you do know it, it does not impact the next                  statement I&rsquo;m going to make, which is: That all humans                  leak out these psychic impressions in the language that they                  choose to use in ordinary conversation. And that was my basic                  premise to begin with.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My working                    theory from that point was that if one could sample enough                    of the conversations going on around the planet and sift                    for the nuance between why one word might be chosen in an                    ordinary conversation as opposed to another word for the                    same conversation that basically you&rsquo;d had a week ago,                  then one could determine what is moving us, if you will, at                  an unconscious level and be able to make some forecasts from                  that in a very interesting way. Sort of an extension, if you                  will, of my work, of the focus of it in 1997, which was commercial.                  Make sense?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes.                Wonderful.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; OK. So basically at that point I&rsquo;m                    assuming that all these psychics are out there. And I had                    educated myself on language, and how linguistics works, and                    how the human brain works, and all this kind of thing. Along                    the way I wrote this little piece of software that allowed                    me to read off the computer screen at up to 2000 words per                    minute, so I was able to suck down vast quantities of text                    over those years. And it led to some interesting breakthroughs                  on its own.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, in                    any event, the issues about language&hellip; It turns                  out that there is a nuance. We have, taking English speakers                  as an example, we might know more or less intuitively or internally                  the definitions of, say, about 100,000 words. Depending on                  your specialty and what you do for a living at the time, technically                  that might be slightly larger or slightly less. But any given                  human English speaker may only use 11 or 12,000 words in any                  given week. And the 11 or 12,000 words is not static from week                  to week to week. It shifts. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So if we                    start thinking about this in terms of set theory and fuzzy                    set theory, which is part of the programming, and I wasn&rsquo;t                    really into the programming of it all, then you start getting                    into the idea of:&nbsp; <em>Well, why from                  week to week to week, do some of the words within our basic                  set fall out and are replaced by others?</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that was my premise that: <em>Oh                      well, that&rsquo;s occurring                    because of something that we are picking up as human antenna                    walking around vibrating on the planet and also picking up                    information just because we&rsquo;re here.</em> Again that                    sort of makes sense, right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; OK.                And then&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But what do you mean, you weren&rsquo;t interested                  in the&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure. You weren&rsquo;t interested                  in the computer modelling side of it? Or are you saying someone                  else took care of that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; No, no. I did all of that. I was fascinated by the                  math in the language and so on. And I&rsquo;m a programmer.                  That&rsquo;s basically where I came from. I programmed for                  a software company. It&rsquo;s like Microsoft. I wrote software                  for phone companies, worked on some very complex stuff. Worked                  for GEC Marconi and very large companies, those kind of things,                  almost exclusively in the software realm. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But eventually                    it rose up to the point where I was working on algorithms                    and computer theory, as opposed to actual software, over                    the course of&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how many&hellip; fifteen,                  twenty years, or something. I got to the point where the software                  component of it became less and I was getting down into the                  deep-sea secrets, if you will.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yeah.                    OK. I would say maybe the philosophical side of it began                  to draw you more.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Sure. Correct. And basically, I developed some software                  that goes on out and eats large chunks of the internet. It                  reads public domain stuff off of forums and other areas, sometimes                  strays into chat groups. It&rsquo;s not very deterministic                  and it follows links, so sometimes when we set it off, we don&rsquo;t                  really know where it&rsquo;s going to end up going in terms                  of what text it&rsquo;s going to eat. And that&rsquo;s part                  of the whole thrill of it all, if you will.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There&rsquo;s                    a serendipitous approach to this because we tell the software,                    which are called <em>spiders</em>, to sit                  on this server, open up this one web page, go and find any                  key words on that web page that we tell you out of this list                  to start with. And if you find those words, read back a certain                  number of words and read forward a certain number of words,                  copy that, do some stuff with it, and if you find any links                  in there, well, have at it. Go follow those and do the same                  thing down there.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    it would go and eat some net and move and read more web pages                    and keep going and going and going. And I think we&rsquo;ve                  got a 256 limit on how deep it can go, in links, before it                  has to unwind and come back and go on to the next stage. So                  it can get some huge amounts of text out of here, on the order                  of, usually, about 90 million leads.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And a lead                    is a construct that we use, where we have 2,048 bites fore                    and aft, if you will, of the key word that it found. It constitutes                    a lead, but it also brings back the context of where it found                    that. In other words if it&rsquo;s in a gardening                  forum, if it&rsquo;s dating, car repair, whatever. And some                  other information, these kind of things...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But in essence&hellip; This                    is something Bill and I had been discussing, asking each                    other whether or not you actually were feeding it key words                  that you were looking for.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; That part of the process is extremely unique and                  I don&rsquo;t want to go too deep into it because it actually                  is the real key to the thing, I think, and it&rsquo;s a trade                  secret. We do have a seed list and we do have a seed list of                  300,000 forums to begin hunting in. But, no, it is not deterministic                  in the sense of data-mining where we say: <em>Go on out and                  count the number of times you run across, you know, tire or                  wall or bridge or something.</em> It doesn&rsquo;t work that                  way.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK,                but&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; OK. Basically what it&rsquo;s doing is this here&rsquo;s                  a long column of what we call context. These contexts can be                  thought of as the name for a larger group of words. And you                  might give it 30,000 of these names to start with. And one                  of them might be <em>forward</em> or <em>energy</em> and we                  tell it: <em>OK, take the word energy out of this long list                  of 30,000 words, go over and read the entire context that we&rsquo;ve                  got associated with that, and store that in your memory</em>.                  And that itself might be 30- or 40,000 words. <em>And then                  go over to this website and see what you can match out of that                  in the following manner.</em> Make sense?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                  It sounds even more complex than I originally thought.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; What that tells me is that, instead, what                  you&rsquo;re doing, actually you&rsquo;re looking for significant                  correlations. Is that a better way of looking at it?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct. We&rsquo;re no longer&hellip; We don&rsquo;t                  actually even look at the words, the words themselves. The                  whole thing was written in a&hellip; The spiders and so forth                  are in a much more deterministic software language called C,                  and some Perl script. Most of the processing is done by Prolog.                  But the Perl script will go through and do a match and replace,                  if you will. And from the time we actually find any of the                  words we&rsquo;re looking for, from that point on, really all                  it deals with is a four-digit text number that we assign to                  it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s just so we are not dealing with the word                  itself, but we are indeed&hellip; Perhaps you heard that the                  government has this&hellip; the US government has this software                  out there, that says: <em>Hmm, this fellow dialed that fellow                  on this phone number,</em> or <em>He sent this fellow an email,</em> and                  it tries to develop up the concept of networks from it, right?                  Who&rsquo;s talking to who. Not about what, but just who&rsquo;s                  talking to whom.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well,                    we actually heard that, you know, they do use key words,                  though.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Oh sure. Sure. But basically what I wanted to come                  back to was that Bill&rsquo;s correct.&nbsp; Actually we&rsquo;re                  not looking for the words per se, nor the count of them, or                  anything but the relationship between that word and other words,                  because we&rsquo;re looking for the nuance.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; I can understand how by taking this very dated snapshot                  of the web you can find out what&rsquo;s happening <em>now</em> and                  what people are looking at <em>now</em>. But how do you target                  specific points at a future time, and a <em>specific</em> future                  time?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; OK.                    So we send the spiders out and they go out and they find                    out that <em>oh oh</em>&hellip; They get real excited                  and they come back and they tell us that somebody&rsquo;s using                  the word &ldquo;jack&rdquo;, like: <em>I&rsquo;ve jacked my                  old lady&rsquo;s car.</em> OK? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, we                    think about that word&hellip; and basically a lot                  of this was all down to slang anyways to get the idea across.                  We look at&hellip; We&rsquo;ve assigned&hellip; Let me back                  up. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got a copy of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> in                  the form of a lexicon, just a list of all the words, way back                  when in 1994 or something, about 300,000 English language words,                  right? And I started assigning values to these things in a                  numeric way to assign emotional relationships to them, so that                  I would say, you know, that this word <em>fear</em> has an                  emotional relationship to <em>trembling</em>, to <em>stomach                  clenching,</em> and all the other various other ways in which                  fear impacts the human body. And then I assigned a numeric                  value to those that indicated the duration of that word fear                  impacting, or that particular word impacting, on the body,                  if you will. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So that <em>anxiety</em> had less of an impact on the body                  instantly, but may be longer-termed duration than fear, because                  fear may be instant, and you may literally empty your bowels                  and piss yourself. But it may only last a few minutes. And                  then:<em> Phew! Boy, that train just barely missed me!</em> And                  blah blah blah. But after a few days it&rsquo;s gone. On the                  other hand, anxiety may dominate your life for decades. Does                  that make sense?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK. So, to assign a value, what we did was, we had on each                  and every one of these words, we assigned what we called a <em>durational</em> <em>value</em>.                  In other words, how long does this word, at its core level,                  have an impact on your particular future? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some might                    be three days, some might be three months. And so in the                    case of slang, usually the impact is short, immediate. It&rsquo;s the intent of slang to get across a new emotional                  context that usually has much more greater immediacy, because                  your father&rsquo;s words are old and staid and they seem to                  have a longer duration and they don&rsquo;t really reflect                  what&rsquo;s happening right now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so when we assign values we took that kind of thing into                  account. So, thus, legal language has in fact a long term value                  on it. So when our spiders come back, we say it came back on                  such-and -so day, found such-and-so word, and such-and-so word                  has this length of duration. And we plot that on the calendar.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. But it&rsquo;s the relationship between&hellip; And                  when you say you actually tracked it in time, that was a value                  judgment on your part. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct. It&rsquo;s                all arbitrary.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And it was based on a relationship between words                  to each other and to life as we know it. In other words, it                  was subject to your interpretation of what it means to, you                  know, as you said, a value judgment basing&hellip; saying fear                  may last a shorter time than anxiety. That could be an interpretation.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; That <em>is</em> an interpretation, not a <em>could                    be</em>. I know that this thing is entirely self-centric.                    What apparently makes it work is that I&rsquo;m not particularly                    egocentric and I&rsquo;m somewhat of an empath, so that I&rsquo;m&hellip; And                    I&rsquo;ve been knocked around on the planet all over and                    exposed to all kinds of people and all kinds of languages                    and understand basically the emotive nature of how cross-cultural                    archetypes work. And then I&rsquo;ve done a lot of research.                    As I say, I educated myself in this in some serious ways.                    So, yes, it is an interpretation but it&rsquo;s a very educated                    interpretation, obviously.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                    Did you do this on your own? Or did you have partners that                  you worked with?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; No, no. I sat around and typed all this stuff up                  and all the software noodled on it over&hellip; from &rsquo;94                  to &rsquo;97, when I first started really getting serious about                  setting down the data. I happened to be running some servers                  and doing something else with those servers, and I had some                  spare processing time here, so while I was sitting here in                  my little office I got serious about it and started the whole                  process off then. It took from &rsquo;94 to &lsquo;97, basically,                  for the ideas to gel and for some of the programming to get                  written.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; How about other languages? Because the Chinese might                  be talking about things that are different from what we&rsquo;re                  talking about in the western world.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Sure, they do it in different&hellip; and in fact,                  different alphabets. Alphabets, to transliteration, to translation                  - all of this really impacts. So we&rsquo;re doing more than                  just simply English language at this stage although we are                  English-centric because that forms the core of our lexicon.                  We could of course have millions of words and millions of languages                  but we&rsquo;re not up that far. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is                    basically a garage operation with myself and a fellow that                    has agreed to go by the name of Igor who is my server slave                    and goes out and manages all my servers while I manage all                    of the rest of the operation. And it&rsquo;s just a, you                  know, basically a two-man operation on this end and George                  Ure is our public face and really about all the free information                  that we want to give everybody in the sense of what we&rsquo;ve                  got. And that&rsquo;s kind of where we&rsquo;re at.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well, this is really fascinating because when you                  gave us access to this information, I was actually delighted                  by the sense of the absurd and also the warning at the beginning                  of your interpretive reports, in other words, where you&rsquo;re                  actually linking up what <em>seem</em> to be key words or key                  concepts, and&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; &hellip;creating                    a storyline that might follow, where one event may follow                    another, and then putting it in a sense, in <em>time</em>. But you have a huge disclaimer at the beginning                  in which you actually say point-blank to people that: <em>You                  could be considered crazy if you actually take this seriously                  or follow it.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s quite correct, and we have to do this.                  This is for entertainment. We&rsquo;re in a litigious society.                  The fact that the Universe chooses to put <em>any</em> <em>kind</em> of                  substantiation behind our words is not our fault. We can&rsquo;t                  be blamed for any part of it, failure of accuracy. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And let                    me point out that we recognize we&rsquo;re in the                  forecasting business, which is shading into fortunetelling.                  And on the other side of that range you have prophecy, and                  that we&rsquo;re gonna get involved with all those kinds of                  emotions. And we wanted to be very clear about this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;re not doing prophecy here. We are forecasting, but                  since forecasting, honestly, is future-telling, there is one                  sin in future-telling and that is accuracy -- good or bad.                  If you&rsquo;ve very accurate, that&rsquo;s a sin. And if you&rsquo;re                  not so accurate, that&rsquo;s a sin. And so we had to be very                  careful to sort of tread a certain line, relative to the times                  we live in. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we&rsquo;re not out there bullshitting people. You know,                  we charged a lot of money to get into our reports to start                  with, and then we cut the price by three-quarters if you decide                  to stay on as a continuing subscriber.

And they got the benefits                  of that before any of the public did, but they had no right                  of ownership of it. And that&rsquo;s kind of how we&rsquo;ve                  decided what the model is going to be here. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Internally                    we&rsquo;re a pirate ship in the sense that we&rsquo;re                  a democracy. We make enough money to survive. We&rsquo;re not                  after wealth. If we ever got to the point where it was sustainable,                  and fully funded, we&rsquo;d just give it away free. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the                    fact of the matter is, we have very high costs in bandwidth.                    We&rsquo;re eating up huge amounts of electricity                  with servers. And so on. So I think I might fit into middle                  class in the United States. My server-slave Igor works doing                  this job and then two others just to keep himself and his future                  wife going.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK, but it also looks like there was a certain level                  at which you wanted to kind of be a &ldquo;gatekeeper&rdquo; over                  this information, to restrict access on a certain level, because                  it was, or could be, you know, taken as very potent and/or,                  you know, I don&rsquo;t know what you want to call it. You                  said the word &ldquo;hot&rdquo; when we talked in a conversation                  earlier about certain issues. And the barometer for getting                  in is just raised really high.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Yes. And that&rsquo;s quite deliberate. A) We needed                  a lot of money to start with, and we need it every month, just                  on our electricity and bandwidth costs, so we must raise those                  funds to keep going. The other issue is that we did not want                  to take funds from&hellip; Everything on this planet is in                  a state of flux. There&rsquo;s no such thing as a fixed point                  in anything, so we have to look at things like a Taoist or                  a Buddhist, where everything&rsquo;s shading from one into                  the other. And it&rsquo;s, really, what part of the circle                  are we looking at? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we&rsquo;re                    in the future-telling business. We do forecasting and some                    parts of that, you have people over there, you know, for                    Wall Street, etc., doing a very piss-poor job. And then on                    the other end of the spectrum you have individuals that you                  have to watch out for, that are prophecy addicts. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    really bothered me. I didn&rsquo;t want the karmic                  debt or interaction with those persons, that because of their                  age and circumstances, are in the position of wishing to spend                  their Social Security money on reading prophecy. And we shade                  close enough to that that they might think that that was the                  case. And so we were very deliberate. And if I could afford                  to set it higher, I would have.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK, that&rsquo;s very interesting and I picked that                  up. So what we&rsquo;re looking at here, and I know that this                  is why we brought you onboard for the moment to talk with you,                  is that you had made some very interesting, I don&rsquo;t know                  if you use the word &ldquo;predictions,&rdquo; but predictions&hellip; what                  seem to be predictions&hellip; about your data.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; We                say forecast.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Forecast.                    OK, your forecast around the month of October. And because,                    as Camelot, we have been inundated with information about                    the month of October from various deep-black sources, including                  some intuitive information that we ourselves were getting. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we                    have, I think Bill would say, 13 data-points that all cross-correlated                    with the month of October, which is very unusual in what                    we&rsquo;ve been doing for the last two and half years,                  which is collecting testimony from whistleblowers and truth-tellers                  around the planet. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So because                    of that, we wanted to contact you and just have you maybe                    describe, as you have done on other shows, what you&rsquo;re                  getting for October, and then kind of maybe try to drill down                  a little bit, based on what we are getting.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Our                    information for October is part of a <em>context</em> that                  we&rsquo;ve been picking up for a number of years relating                  to what we call &ldquo;The Death of the Dollar.&rdquo; We started                  talking publicly about &ldquo;The Death of the Dollar,&rdquo; I                  think on July 4th, 2007, but we&rsquo;d actually been picking                  it up in the data a number of years before that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have                    a tendency to see, to find, really big events showing up                    years ahead of time and it takes us a while to sort through                  everything and really get a handle on what was going on. The                  closer we get to the event, the more data-points we get within                  our source that allows us to get a broader picture. So, at                  this stage, we&rsquo;ve got a pointer that said we would hit                  a sort of an emotional plateau. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bear in mind that all of our stuff is basically built around                  a numeric representation of <em>what I think human emotions                  are</em>, relative to certain words, and I&rsquo;ve used that                  form of input for that as well. We had this data stream that                  said that around 9/22, around the 22nd of September, we would                  reach a point where, from there until the 27th, we would have                  an emotional plateau of some high level of what we call <em>Building                  Emotional Tension.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And <em>Building Emotional Tension</em> is                    the state we&rsquo;re                  in right now. And everybody who&rsquo;s worried about the market                  knows exactly what that feels like, and what it does to their                  digestion, their sleep, etc., hair falling out, and so on.                  So, it&rsquo;s probably pretty self-evident. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we then had data that suggested that there might be a                  little tiny dip from 9/27 until October 7th in terms of the                  amount of that building tension, but it was basically still                  on that same plateau. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then                    on October 7th.&hellip; And I <em>chose</em>&hellip;well,                  you know, the Universe moved me to choose it, I chose ten minutes                  after 7 in the morning, UTC time, which makes it ten after                  midnight my time here on the Pacific coast on October 7th would                  be the point at which we would slip into what I call <em>Release                  Language.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Release Language</em> is                    where everybody is letting out the emotion, as opposed to                    letting the emotion in, in effects on their body. They just                    can&rsquo;t take it any more, and                  they&rsquo;re expressing that emotion. Good, bad, or indifferent,                  they&rsquo;re expressing it. So <em>release</em> has to do                  with expression. <em>Building</em> has to do with input. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we&rsquo;re going to get into a period that goes from                  October 7 until&hellip; Now the new data run is showing it                  moved into about mid-March of 2009, pretty straight-forward <em>release </em>language                  that entire period, with no little stair-steps, if you will,                  in the <em>building-tension</em> language. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It needs                    to be said that mostly life is up-and-down, up-and-down,                    you know, good days/bad days kind of thing in our giant collective.                  We rarely&hellip;and in fact have <em>never</em> since 1997                  seen anything in the models that looks like what&rsquo;s gonna                  happen in October, from October through the first part of March.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And to make people aware of what you saw during 911&hellip; You                  didn&rsquo;t see such a long release period, if I remember                  correctly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; No. That&rsquo;s quite correct. There was about 6                  days of a fairly precipitous release following 911 and then                  there were three or four days of less steep release. And then,                  basically on the 11th day following 911, we were back into                  that stair-step building period. We&rsquo;d already, if you                  will, absorbed the emotional impact of the event and were starting                  to respond and build emotional patterns to cope with it all. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So if we                    look at the two in a comparison the&hellip;not the                  level, not the intensity of the emotion, but the duration of                  the emotion, is many, many, many times longer than what was                  felt after 911. But that isn&rsquo;t to say that it&rsquo;s                  gonna be emotionally as intense that way <em>continuously</em>.                  That rarely would happen, I would think. It could, but it just                  doesn&rsquo;t seem to be too likely.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK, but what about the actual event itself? In other                  words, was the 911, I don&rsquo;t know, &ldquo;spike&rdquo; if                  you will, <em>matching</em> the spike that you&rsquo;re getting                  on October 7th? Or is it much higher for October 7th?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t work that way, OK? Because our data                  can&rsquo;t be compared exactly from 2001 to now, because in                  the nature of our programming we&rsquo;ve refined our technique                  over time. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we have                    to state that right out, that we&rsquo;re kind                  of in a sense like a doctor that discovers a new disease, and                  then over the course of time gets really, really good at diagnosing.                  And it spreads out -- everybody gets really good at diagnosing                  the disease. And all of a sudden you&rsquo;re seeing statistics                  showing that this disease is everywhere. And it&rsquo;s just                  simply because we&rsquo;ve been able to look at it with a sensitization                  to the process. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we can&rsquo;t make a direct comparison that way. Nor can                  we say that there&rsquo;s going to be a particular event at                  7:10 in the morning UTC. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying: That my model-space, with                  the best granularity I&rsquo;ve got, shows the whole planet                  starting to shift over into release language. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There may                    indeed be an event, and I&rsquo;m kind of expecting                  something, but it need not be either visible on the global                  media-screen nor particularly intense at that stage to start                  the process off because we&rsquo;re at such a huge level of                  building tension. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The event                    could be as innocuous as someone showing up at the LIBOR                    Bank early in the morning to go to work and the door being                    locked and the key broken off in the door such that it takes                    an additional four hours to get in. And LIBOR doesn&rsquo;t                  open when it should. And a fiscal tremor goes around the world                  that crashes the whole financial system. See?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So it could be a rather small actual event, is what                  you&rsquo;re saying...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct,&nbsp; correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; &hellip;but                    what it portends, or what it results in, is of very long                  duration.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct.                    Because that door was not locked. You know, for want of a                  nail the horse was lost&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. I know that you said that, if I remember correctly&hellip; Like                  on Rense, you talked about that there were actually <em>proportions</em> within                  the actual event&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Yes, that&rsquo;s                correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; &hellip;that                    there were military a certain amount, economic a certain                  amount. Can you explain that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct. But that&rsquo;s                    not <em>within</em> the                  event. That&rsquo;s <em>within the state of the model-space</em> at                  the time the event occurs. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bear in                    mind, see, we don&rsquo;t do prophecy. We construct                  a highly quirky and weird little interface in time in a model-space                  in the computer and then advance it tick by tick by tick and                  watch as it makes changes. And then, on top of that, we have                  to look for something significant. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what                    we&rsquo;re seeing is, at the point at which this                  trigger event or precipitating event, however we think about                  it, occurs, the emotional tension balance is about 48% economic,                  shading up to about 51% at the moment, but that may back down                  by the time we get to October 7th. And then about 40 to 45%                  military. Then the rest is what we call <em>Terra Intrusions</em>,                  which is really Earth changes kinds of things, hurricanes,                  that sort of deal.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But                    when you say it could be a small thing that lasts five months                  in duration, it could be triggered by a tiny thing,</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Even                innocuous. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; It could be something &hellip; I&rsquo;m                asking you&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; it                could be a calamity.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; &hellip;whether                    it could be a virus for example, could be a release of a                  virus that at first is actually not even noticeable.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; I suspect that that won&rsquo;t be the case in October.                  If that&rsquo;s the case, the virus has already been released,                  because what&rsquo;s gonna happen is, the <em>language</em> shifts                  at that point. So somebody starts talking about something at                  that point. Now, whether it&rsquo;s a whole lot of people talking                  about it&hellip;?

It gets all sliced up into                    all these various different entities, and then over time                    we allow the Universe to give us words to populate &lsquo;em.                  And it turns out that over time whole lots of words that all                  fall under the context of<em> Revolution</em> showed up in                  the markets entity, and showed up in our representations of                  the populace of the US, and showed up in global populace representation,                  and so on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So these                    are not keys words.

Rather, the data is coming back that nicely                  and neatly sorts, in all of our entities, into those categories                  that are headed by those words. And I sure hope that was understandable.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yeah, it&rsquo;s                kind of like packets.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Exactly.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: &nbsp;OK. But I&rsquo;m also interested in the way you&rsquo;re                  looking your data, such that you&rsquo;re interpreting your                  data. Do you find that looking at it changes it?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Yeah, Heisenberg&hellip; No, I don&rsquo;t believe                  so.

Undoubtedly at a quanta level there&rsquo;s some                  of that going on. Now, if you&rsquo;re asking: <em>Because                  we see this, will the Universe change?</em> We don&rsquo;t                  know about that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. What about the idea that you&rsquo;re&hellip; I                  mean, somehow I stumbled on your information quite some time                  ago, although I didn&rsquo;t remember it as being associated                  with your website. Then when you re-emerged, and you started                  to be, you know, sort of have more of a media profile, if you                  will, which seems to be even lately&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Right.                Let me tell you why that is.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; All right, let&rsquo;s divert here for a second.                  Our model is built in this software called InteliCAD InteliCAD                  is an artificial model-space, if you will, for drawing virtually                  any kind of an object in a CAD sense &ndash; computer-aided                  design. It turned out to be very handy for us because we can                  expand it at will. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Part of                    our problem is that if we have people read our reports and                    then cut and paste the text out there, when our spiders read                    their own words, then it&rsquo;s considered to be self-reinforcing,                  and we spiral down, and everything goes to hell in a handbasket                  real quick. So we have to be very careful about who reads our                  reports so that we don&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em out there cutting                  and pasting this stuff wildfire, because we end up spiraling                  down and we can&rsquo;t do anything. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order                    to help prevent this I developed this software. In late 2001                    I started working on it and it went through 2003 and I finally                    got it working and we called it MOMS. And that&rsquo;s                  the <em>Model of Model-Space</em>. And basically it&rsquo;s                  a representation of OUR work within the model-space, separate                  from the model itself, a rather abstract, kind of screwy idea,                  but it works very well. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within                    there, we model ourselves, for instance. And along about,                    let&rsquo;s say December of 2006, basically MOMS started                  being able to put out some forecasts for <em>us</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, this                    means I&rsquo;ve got to divert for a second and                  say that my particular approach to reading these forecasts                  is based on sort of a non-western style of thought, and so                  I started taking them seriously. And I thought to myself: <em>Hmmm,                  wonder what would happen if I started harmonizing with what                  MOMS says might be in my future?</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s where we are now, because MOMS suggested                  that it was a good time to get on out and &ldquo;capture&rdquo; October                  7. So I said: <em>OK, MOMS, I&rsquo;ll do it.</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So in sense you&rsquo;re                  running an experiment within an experiment.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; A                radical linguistic experiment, correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; &hellip; can                the future be altered?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But going out there, that&rsquo;s actually&hellip; gets                  back to my question.

And                  they&rsquo;re going to take this onboard and add this to the                  rest of the stuff we&rsquo;ve been telling them. And, in a                  sense, that could act upon the event such that either it won&rsquo;t                  happen, or&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Or                it will.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; &hellip;or                  it may be modified in some form or fashion.

Release                    language, for instance, might happen on, early in the morning                    on October 7, because some idiot pushes a button and starts                    off a nuclear bomb. Or releases a virus. Or does some other                  nasty thing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Release language could also happen because 25- or 35- or 100-million                  people wake up that morning and say: <em>I&rsquo;m not gonna                  take this shit anymore. I&rsquo;m going out there and stand                  there until they arrest that guy.</em> And something changes.                  That kind of release language is different, but it&rsquo;s                  nonetheless release language.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But are you able to tell the difference when you                  look at what you&rsquo;ve got, that it&rsquo;s positive versus                  negative?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; <em>Positive</em> and <em>negative</em> have an interesting                  connotation within our work, and within the lexicon and within                  language itself. And a lot of it is culturally based.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well,                how about <em>constructive</em> versus <em>destructive</em>?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Destructive. Yes, we are able to tell that. And at                  this point in our reading, in terms of how we&rsquo;re going                  through the data, the release language from October 7 onward                  is not what anybody would consider to be pleasant, so you may                  want to put a deconstructive nature on it. It&rsquo;s something                  that we must go through. Let us understand that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A revolution                    is a horrible, terrible, brutal thing in which lots of emotions                    and people are shed, but it is a positive thing in the end.                    Good, bad, whether they win or not, the revolutionary means                    is positive. But it brings along with it a lot of brutality                  and excesses and so on. But you&rsquo;ve got to get that out                  of your system, just the way that we <em>must</em> have the                  coming crash in the economic system, which will start on October                  7 regardless. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The data                    seems to suggest that, regardless of what the trigger event                    is, over those next five or six months the economic system                  goes from really, really nasty now to something we don&rsquo;t                  want to even describe.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That means that things like&hellip; I&rsquo;m gonna                  ask you here&hellip; Things like food shortages&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And                    specifically because you track English more than any other                    language, is it focused on the US? Or is it because the US                    keeps coming up? Because people do speak English all over                  the globe and on the internet.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Rather the latter, and because everybody is so focused                  on the US, mostly hating us, or denying that hate, if you&rsquo;re                  inside these boundaries, that all those emotions are focused                  on the US whether you&rsquo;re in the Amazon or you&rsquo;re                  in Pakistan or wherever. So, yeah, we have a tendency to be                  US-centric and I frequently apologize to our international                  readers. We just can&rsquo;t help that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So what you are seeing in the future, at least in                  the next 5 months, linked to the October 7 economic situation,                  is that it&rsquo;s dire now but it&rsquo;s gonna be something&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Brutally true. OK. This weekend we&rsquo;re putting                  up a new report that continues to refine that, because we&rsquo;re                  getting in new data. In the market descriptors, the market                  section there, we&rsquo;re gonna be describing it as <em>brutally                  transformative.</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Brutally                  transformative.

Here we currently have a situation                  where 6 percent of the population on the planet is using 28                  percent of the biota. That six percent had better get down                  to 6 percent, because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen.                  And any of the ramifications from that is all speculation. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Will we                    have food shortages?

Imagine yourself right now in the United States,                  just a walking-around, regular kind of a guy, and five months                  from now you&rsquo;ll be opening your eyes. Many of these people                  will be encountering <em>huge</em> amounts of cognitive dissonance                  because it will be as though they&rsquo;ve walked out of their                  house to just after the collapse of the Soviet Union and they&rsquo;re                  living in Russia.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And                is this a rise in chaos?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Certainly.                No question.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                So are you tracking chaos itself?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; We                do have a chaos subset of contexts, yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                    And are you seeing a rise in chaos that continues up to and                  beyond 2012?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; No. Our data sets is&hellip; As a rule, we start                  losing granularity at about 19 months. That&rsquo;s because                  of the nature of language, that most of the language, for instance,                  that might impact your particular life in any given week that                  would extend beyond 19 months you don&rsquo;t use. You would                  rarely use language that had that level of duration. So granularity                  falls off after 19 months. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we did                    have some spotty bits of information and we&rsquo;re                  starting to put together this new entity that we&rsquo;re calling <em>FuturePop</em> that                  is gonna be about the populace that will exist in about 2018                  and what they&rsquo;re gonna be doing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But there                    are curious sets of inconsistencies that are appearing around                    2012, and that&rsquo;s probably because of the emotional                  response that everybody has to it. But it could very well be                  due to the biospheric conditions that we&rsquo;re all gonna                  be facing.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; I                    found a really interesting point that was recurring in some                    of these reports, which was talking about, in essence, what                  appeared to be a battle with aliens.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Oh sure. Yeah, we&rsquo;ve got really strange stuff                  in there that suggests, for instance, that we&rsquo;re gonna                  go through a summer of hell in 2009 here in the US that will                  precipitate a seething anger and so forth into actual bloody                  revolution. <em>AmRev-2</em> we&rsquo;re calling it. But it&rsquo;ll                  just be part of a global wave of revolution against what we                  call The Powers That Be. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is also coincident with a meta-data layer that we call <em>Secrets                    Revealed</em>, where events of revolution goes on. Certain                    institutions will be captured by the populace and the data                    will be released that&rsquo;s been hidden for hundreds of                    years, which then starts its own set of threads and means                    about revolution. They&rsquo;ve been duped. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if                    we go forward in time through 2010, we get into the area                    where we&rsquo;re starting to get what we call <em>Alien                  Wars</em>&hellip; information about 2011. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now this                    has to be understood, that the granularity out there is very                    sparse. We don&rsquo;t have a whole lot of details.                  It does appear that this is not some kind of false flag operation.                  It also does appear that humans are involved at many different                  levels, not merely at a shooting level, but also as perhaps                  some kind of a <em>prize</em> level, like, you know, we&rsquo;re                  what everybody is fighting over, that kind of thing.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right.                You talk about human body parts, etc.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Yes, exactly. Yes. Well, that&rsquo;s                    actually coming from the release of all the Russian and other                    UFO information around the planet these past few months.                    Once that hit all the various different language boards,                    it really started coming out as to how many of the crashes                  they had found human body parts catalogued in.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. And just to come around to the election, because                  we briefly talked about that. You said you don&rsquo;t dial                  in on personalities, but you do dial in on incidents that seem                  to be&hellip; or the trends around those events, such that                  you talk a lot in your papers about confusion around the election                  time.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct, which I think you&rsquo;d have to agree                  we&rsquo;re entering into. The Republicans are confused as                  to with why McCain is doing whatever he&rsquo;s doing. And                  everybody&rsquo;s confused about the economy, and it&rsquo;s                  all affecting this. And McCain&rsquo;s even confused about                  whether or not he&rsquo;s gonna debate [the first scheduled                  national TV debate with Obama] and it&rsquo;s getting more                  confusing as we go forward. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We still                    have information that seem to indicate that McCain could                    drop out due to health before the&hellip; actually near                  the end of September, but really before the 15th of October.                  But it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that&hellip; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because                    we&rsquo;ve already seen some of that language fulfilled.                  He has <em>withdrawn</em>. He announced that he <em>withdrew</em>.                  It was from the debate, not the campaign. But he suspended                  his campaign. So the word <em>campaign</em> came in there,                  and it was due to the economic health of the country. So it                  was sort of a quasi-hit. The language we&rsquo;d seen a year                  ago to that effect about this time actually has started to                  appear. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s&hellip; George Ure calls this a rickety time                  machine. And he&rsquo;s got a real good point. There are big                  gaps in the technology. And it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s                  foolproof. And this is why we really have to worry about all                  these people that think it&rsquo;s prophecy and it&rsquo;s                  gonna be written in stone. It just does not work that way. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we&rsquo;re right, we have a tendency to be absolutely,                  spectacularly right. We refine it over time. We&rsquo;re getting                  better as we go forward, so maybe we&rsquo;ll be a lot more                  right than we have in the past. And in the past we&rsquo;ve                  actually done, we think, twice as good as chance should allow. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In that sense, maybe McCain <em>will</em> withdraw                    finally. In itself, it might not be good, etc., etc, increasing                    confusion. And we&rsquo;ve been talking about the fact that there&rsquo;s                  just basically the dominant word is <em>confusion</em> around                  the election, and we&rsquo;ve been reporting that since January                  of this year, but we saw it since probably June of last year.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. One thing that I&rsquo;ve                    noticed is that you actually were talking about McCain dropping                    out [of the first debate] and yet I think today in the news                  I actually heard that he has now decided he will debate.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Sure, sure. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m                    saying. The stuff we get is not written in stone. What we                    saw was the appearance of language that said: <em>McCain /</em> <em>withdraw /</em> <em>campaign</em>.                  Now we didn&rsquo;t know that there would be other words in                  between there because of the nature of what we&rsquo;ve encountered.                  Beyond that, we didn&rsquo;t know that there would be any supposition. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, also we have to acknowledge, time is kind of strange.                  McCain may <em>yet</em> withdraw from the campaign as a whole                  and all of that language together was what we saw even though                  it was strung out over a number of days.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So it sounds like when you find language that matches,                  an occurrence occurs, in a sense it&rsquo;s kind of like solving                  the crossword puzzle, or in a way it&rsquo;s almost like the                  Bible code. The words themselves&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; No, no. I would skip the Bible codes business, because                  the Bible codes will work on any sufficiently long text. And                  even if you were to unscramble our DNA and just put it out                  there, the various key letters, the Bible codes will bring                  back what you think might be meaningful. And that&rsquo;s not                  how we do stuff. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it                    is true that there is a&hellip; This is not deterministic,                  and we don&rsquo;t know exactly how time will work out. And                  there is some&hellip; a whole lot stuff about this that we                  just don&rsquo;t know, that we&rsquo;re learning as we go along.                  We&rsquo;ve had new postulates form over the last couple of                  years, which we sit down and noodle on this stuff, and they                  appear to be reasonable theorems at the moment. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And one of the postulates is this idea that there is <em>bleed-through</em>.                  And the idea of <em>bleed-through</em> is best illustrated                  with the Sumatran tsunami, which occurred at the end of the                  year. At the beginning of that year we got the words for <em>300,000                  people dead or killed or missing / a nation pushed back to                  a previous age / large earthquake / and electric-driven water</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then we also got words that said <em>courthouse emptied                    due to the earthquake / famous personalities scrambling around                    due to the earthquake as they scrambled out of the courthouse,</em> and                    so on and so on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the                    beginning of the year we couldn&rsquo;t tell that it                  was two separate events, that in that year the Scott Peterson                  trial in California would be emptied due to an earthquake and                  all these famous lawyers and stuff would go scrambling around                  with all the media, as they all emptied the courthouse building.                  And then another six-plus months would happen and the 300,000                  people would be killed or missing and the nation would be shoved                  back to a previous age.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK, but in this case you actually didn&rsquo;t                  get the name of the nation. Is that right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s                correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. And you also didn&rsquo;t&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s                deliberate. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; &hellip;get                California in the Scott Peterson.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct. And that&rsquo;s deliberate because&hellip; See,                  here&rsquo;s part of our problem. On the internet we&rsquo;re                  not actually after <em>conscious language</em>. So we don&rsquo;t                  go out and count the number of times someone says California                  and match that up and say: <em>OK, the earthquake&rsquo;s gonna                  happen in California.</em> We can&rsquo;t rely on that stuff                  because geographic references are so frequent. And we can&rsquo;t                  rely on someone saying numbers. So we work on archetypes. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, you&rsquo;re                    correct. Just like this year. We knew there was gonna be                    a large earthquake. I sent out a warning to our subscribers.                    George Ure put it on his urbansurvival.com site some 36 hours                    ahead of the Chinese quake. We knew there was just gonna                    be one great big whump of a quake. We had no clue as to where                    it would be beyond certain boundaries. And we refine this                  over time.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    next time we do an earthquake predication&hellip; which                  is for December 10th through 12th. We think there&rsquo;s gonna                  be two very large earthquakes. They&rsquo;re not necessarily                  in the same place on the planet, but they could be. We have                  some references that we seem to think are valid for the Pacific                  northwest, where I live. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also                    have some references for the band of latitude 32 degrees                    north to 36 degrees north, which would cover places life                    California, Japan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, etc.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s                  the best we can do at this stage.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Are                  you emotionally affected by your work at this point?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; I tell ya, I&rsquo;m                  a depressed bastard, no question about it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; [laughs]                Seriously?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Seriously.

We got the Columbia                  space shuttle disaster. We got the disaster, the accident to                  the Greek athletes prior to that Olympics. We&rsquo;ve gotten                  the quake for China.

Some of our subscribers                    made a huge amount of money because we told them about the                    Brazilian oil fields to be discovered about 8 months before                  it occurred and they bought in on Brazilian oil-hunting companies. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, as I said, we figure about better than chance. About half                  of what we say ends up manifesting in a way that we can say                  hit it by time or the language descriptors. And eventually                  probably about 55% of the language ends up showing up even                  if we misinterpreted it.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                    Bill, did you have any questions that you wanted to run by                  Clif at this point?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been more interesting than [laughs] some                  of the interviews I&rsquo;ve heard because it&rsquo;s focused                  on some of the methodology and the technology behind the forecasting                  which I and many other people find very, very interesting.                  The details have really been covered elsewhere. What&rsquo;s                  also interesting, I think, to many of the people listening                  to this, is that you&rsquo;ve given some indication of your                  own personal involvement in this.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Yes,                    in essence I <em>have</em> to, because MOMS                  had suggested that there were some unique things that may be                  linguistic experiments to be tried here at this particular                  point in time. And I&rsquo;m willing to try that because the                  potential for gain outweighs the risk. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And because,                    to be quite honest, we are at that huge crux from now on.                    From October 7th onward we won&rsquo;t return                  to the emotional levels that we&rsquo;re at now, in a positive                  way, until beyond 2012. George Ure and I have decided that                  if we&rsquo;re still here in 2013 we&rsquo;re gonna get together                  and party like it&rsquo;s 1999. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                    This is interesting, because you actually said there would                  be a five month time after October 7.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Oh                sure.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But                    what you&rsquo;re now saying &hellip; you&rsquo;re                  actually saying there&lsquo;s a place that we&rsquo;re at here,                  emotionally, that&rsquo;s actually we&rsquo;re gonna go <em>down</em> from                  here to 2012 -- for the next four years?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; OK. Up / Down. You really shouldn&rsquo;t                    phrase it that way. Just like Buckminster Fuller used to                    bitch at everybody, because there is no <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> on                  this planet. There&rsquo;s only closer to the center of the                  Earth and further away form it. An <em>in</em> and <em>out</em> kind                  of approach. So let&rsquo;s not use pejorative terms like up                  or down because that implies certain things. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However,                    the emotional tonalities that we&rsquo;re living                  at the moment, especially those tonalities associated with                  words like <em>normalcy</em> and <em>nostalgia</em>, and all                  of this kind of thing, will not be seen again. From October                  7th onward, we won&rsquo;t recover those, as near as I can                  tell in my data. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it may well be the case that, you know, those things that                  come along, such as the global coastal events, subsequent magnetic                  shifts, and perhaps even a crustal shift and the destruction                  of most of the population on the planet, may indeed be the                  reason for that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have to say that the biospheric degradation, and the changes                  in the solar system, the magnetosphere, the heliosphere, etc.                  etc. all tend to support the idea that the language is spitting                  out to us, that the bizarre days ahead are -- however inconceivable                  -- are basically our destiny.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;We&rsquo;re                    gonna live through some of the strangest times that have                    certainly been around on the planet for many thousands of                    years. And on the other side of it, those of us who pop out,                  we probably all ought to get together and say <em>Whew!</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So in a certain sense, you&rsquo;re relying your                  entire model on the &ldquo;psychic-ness,&rdquo; the intuitive                  psychic ability of people when they&rsquo;re speaking.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Yes, in a certain sense, because they don&rsquo;t                  know that they&rsquo;re leaking out these changes. And I have                  some, if you will, &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; knowledge that tells                  me that&nbsp; that&rsquo;s a pragmatic way to go. And that                  hidden knowledge comes down to a whole series of enlightenment                  events I&rsquo;ve had over the course of my life, and that                  have got me to where I&rsquo;m at. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;m self educated. I didn&rsquo;t go to college for                  linguistics. I don&rsquo;t have degrees in any of these things.                  I taught myself to program. Anything I&rsquo;ve created I&rsquo;ve                  done on my own this way with the assistance of those in the                  universe around me. And it has chosen&hellip; the universe                  has chosen to provide me with some enlightenment experiences                  that set my frame of reference outside of what we might think                  of as &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; And that has aided me in this ability                  to do this.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s evident in what you write. And, you                  know, I have to say that we&rsquo;re very lucky that a person                  such as yourself came up with this sort of modeling technique.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; OK, there we would disagree, see, because I don&rsquo;t                  believe in luck.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; The                    universe wanted this to happen and it created this way so                  this confluence of events is precisely&hellip; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; By                    virtue of who you are, this is why it was created the way                  it was created.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Exactly.                    Exactly. The universe said: <em>Well we                    need this thing, you know, in this time, so let us start                    altering and working on this particular human</em>. And,                    by the way, before I incarnated I checked out everybody and                    said: <em>Oh that would be an interesting life to live</em>,                    and plopped into that human. And here we are.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; [laughs] OK. I think that that&rsquo;s really great                  and I happen to agree with that perspective. One thing that                  I&rsquo;ve noticed about reality is that in many ways when&hellip; if                  you want to track it, we are aware of what&rsquo;s coming because                  in a certain sense it&rsquo;s already happened, because time                  is actually not linear.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; So I think that that must also be influencing what                  you&rsquo;re talking about when you say, in a sense, that most                  people know. It sort of invades their language, if you will.                  Their consciousness is revealed by their language and their                  choice of language.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Yeah, it actually ends up being&hellip; As we say,                  it leaks out. Even if they wanted to stop it, I don&rsquo;t                  think they could.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Exactly. They can&rsquo;t help it because they actually                  do know. It&rsquo;s actually true that we actually do know                  and therefore we choose, based on our knowing, without knowing                  that we&rsquo;re doing so. Or at least some of us.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; We                    also have to work around the limitations of the human brain                    relative to that as well, because the human <em>brain</em> has                  been engineered to perceive time in a linear fashion. And at                  the same point, the <em>mind</em> is non-linear. So there&rsquo;s                  that kind of like duality, both/and, juxtaposition kind of                  stuff there. So there&rsquo;s sort of a bleed-through both                  ways within the individual. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then, because most individuals are in a state of denial                  about the true nature of reality, it expresses itself, as we                  say, in the bleed-through or the leaking out of the psychic                  impressions.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s also the levels at which you experience                  it. In other words, when you&rsquo;re talking about this modeling                  technique, in a sense when you&rsquo;re in one sense of the                  mind, if you will, where you&rsquo;re not being linear, then                  it&rsquo;s actually not a problem because you see the long                  range and you sense that this is actually gonna be good in                  the long run although it&rsquo;s gonna be difficult to go through.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Well,                yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; But if you&rsquo;re                in a linear state...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s                  rather frightening, yes. You feel trapped there.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re in a linear state, you tend to sort                  of &ldquo;Pavlov&rdquo; into the fear mechanism and so on.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Right. And, you know, the Taoists say that an ordinary                  person sees everything as a curse or a blessing, and the aware                  observer or the enlightened being or the sage, however you                  want to label &rsquo;em, sees everything as a challenge. And                  that&rsquo;s quite true, because &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; are                  labels we <em>apply</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, those                    people that are trapped in the linear view of the world are                    indeed subject to this up-and-down, up-and-down, and they&rsquo;re suffering greatly at the moment, especially                  on this economic stuff. And they&rsquo;re gonna suffer even                  worse in the coming months and that&rsquo;s expressed in the                  language that they&rsquo;re pre-saying now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so,                    all of our words, our whole language actually encodes all                    of this information. It&rsquo;s just layer upon layer upon                  layer that could just drive you crazy if you start me off on                  it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because &hellip; Pre-<em>saying</em>, pre-<em>sage</em>, <em>fore</em>-cast &hellip; look                  at the roots of the words, the etymology of how all this evolved.                  And you see that we&rsquo;ve been doing this for countless                  generations. And our own language, taken from ourselves, encodes                  deeper levels of meaning than our conscious mind is aware of. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I&rsquo;m not talking about the funny fellows that&rsquo;re                  going out doing reverse speech and trying to find hidden information                  and stuff like that. I&rsquo;m talking about just linguists,                  and what they know about how closely connected our particular                  expressions of language, no matter what language we use on                  the planet, and DNA. DNA itself is a language. And it starts                  tunneling in, and you start getting all these cross-connections.                  And you end up with a view of the universe that says: <em>Hmm,                  wonder what people are saying today.</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. Well, that&rsquo;s                    actually very good. In a sense, for an example, if you say <em>death</em>, it can                  appear to be very limiting, but if you say <em>release</em>,                  you&rsquo;re actually talking about death but it&rsquo;s from                  a very positive point of view.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m not into sugarcoating anything. I come                  from a tradition that is&hellip; I&rsquo;ll be flat-out about                  it, it&rsquo;s Aikido, and I follow Osensei&lsquo;s metaphysical                  approach to things. And that relates all the way back to what&rsquo;s                  known as The Complete Reality School of Taoism. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So no,                    death is death and needs to be treated as death. And it&rsquo;s&hellip; Positive or negative is someone&rsquo;s                  personal view of how they&rsquo;re going to deal with that.                  And all death is traumatic and painful until the moment of                  separation and unconsciousness. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. And                  there are &ldquo;positive&rdquo; deaths, you know, good / bad.                  I&rsquo;ve been involved with a lot of deaths and the after-death                  experiences of people. And it&rsquo;s&hellip; You gotta face                  it flat-out.

And                  we&rsquo;re all happy with the economic condition and then                  everybody lays down their arms and isn&rsquo;t shooting at                  each other any more and the Israelis and Palestinians embrace                  each other as their long-lost cousins that they truly are.                  Now you tell me if the odds favor that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.

And some                  people have been successful at doing that, and others haven&rsquo;t.                  So, you really don&rsquo;t want me to say: <em>Oh, go and do                  x, y, and z.</em> And I don&rsquo;t want the karmic implications                  of that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; No,                    but I did see a positive event that had to do with chemtrails                  that you talked about.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; There&rsquo;s going to be an event such that it&rsquo;s                  gonna clear the skies, you even said.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Right,                    but that may not be <em>positive,</em> because                  the chemtrails appear to be The Powers That Be attempting to                  change the albedo of the planet and to reflect back radiation.                  All other suppositions as to their activity seems to be secondary. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If they&rsquo;re gone, we may suffer greatly.

Maybe other                  untold numbers of humans will survive and the species will                  flourish because we were able to reflect radiations that are                  incoming and there won&rsquo;t be that level of damage. We                  don&rsquo;t know&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well, let me ask you this. If&hellip; In a sense,                  my understanding of chemtrails is&hellip; You&rsquo;re saying                  the secondary effects may not be positive, but the primary                  might be exactly what you say it is. But if it&rsquo;s secret                  language and it&rsquo;s not released, how is it that you think                  you could be tracking it? Because my understanding of what                  the chemtrails are doing is something else entirely, and it                  sounds like you haven&rsquo;t tapped into that. If it&rsquo;s <em>secret</em>,                  it&rsquo;s not going to be talked about.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Right. But we don&rsquo;t deal in things that are                  talked about. We don&rsquo;t count words. We deal in archetypes                  and then, up through an interpretation, we apply them to what                  we see around us. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, for                    instance, we&rsquo;ve got an archetype of a maritime                  disaster that would cause the whole United States to go into                  a great sorrow. And we&rsquo;ve got all of this information.                  And it turned out not to be <em>maritime </em>per se, because                  we were off in the interpretation of that archetype. And we                  should have just translated it as &ldquo;the ship&rdquo; and                  then matched it closer to reality and decided that it was the                  Shuttle, the <em>space</em> ship. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we did                    some of these things wrong. But at the same time, we don&rsquo;t                    deal in conscious words per se. We deal in the archetypes                  and let it bubble up from that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So our                    understanding of chemtrails comes from the archetype that                    The Powers That Be are intensely scared and scared at all                    these different levels. One of the things they&rsquo;re                  scared about is not going into an ice age. If we don&rsquo;t                  go into an ice age, as in Lovelock&rsquo;s book, Gaia is doomed                  to go the way of, supposedly, Venus. We get extra-hot and everybody&rsquo;ll                  die off. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so,                    usually at this particular point in our orbital permutations                  we get to the 100,000-year cycle and we go into a mini ice                  age, which cools everything down, refreshes the oceans, etc.,                  etc., That is not occurring at this point because we&rsquo;re                  lining up with the dark rift on the side of the galactic central,                  and we&rsquo;re getting extra radiation coming on in, which                  is heating everything up. Everything from the GRBs, the solar                  radiation, the heliosphere radiation pouring on in, etc., is                  raising the temperature on all the planets, in spite of the                  fact that, at this point in our cycle of 100,000 years, we                  should be cooling down, to the betterment of the planet.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So The Powers That Be got really scared and at least at one                  bespoke level of their internal fear they wanted to react and                  change the albedo by putting up a radiation shield that would                  cool the planet down as though we had glaciers all over the                  place, as though we <em>had</em> gone into the ice age. They                  hoped to trigger it that way. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, there&rsquo;s also all kinds of other fears buried way                  down deep in the archetype that goes to some really strange                  stuff, like they&rsquo;re <em>really</em> afraid of the pineal                  gland in humans.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right.                    The consciousness of our own power. And, on top of that,                    also alien invasion. And on top of that, what about Planet                  X? And what are you getting in that respect?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; The Planet X stuff is a non-starter. It appears to                  be almost 100 percent disinformation from our viewpoint, in                  terms of what we call SKED: Subject Knowledge Elucidates the                  Domain. It&rsquo;s an analysis technique. And within our data-sets                  none of the Planet X material is as it is mythologically defined                  within our current culture. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, yeah,                    there&rsquo;s probably large-sized asteroids, etc.,                  zipping around, and even some mini-planets. But there&rsquo;s                  no giant dwarf star kind of thing that&rsquo;s gonna come on                  in and cause that kind of problem -- because the solar system,                  at one point, cannot survive such a thing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That does                    not allow&hellip; For instance, the whole mythology                  does not allow for what we call quanta effects of interplanetary                  kinds of material. In other words, not just gravity, but there&rsquo;s                  also antigravity, a repulsive force. And so, those kinds of                  things intrude on the idea. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plus, in                    our data-sets, Planet X is within a very deep subset of what                    we call the SpaceGoatFarts, in an area of disinfo. We&rsquo;ve                    never shown any of the Planet X info emotionally, in the                  context in which we use, to come out of that category.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK. But it sounds like you&rsquo;re putting your                  interpretation in terms of the science that you know versus                  not being able to talk about the science you don&rsquo;t know.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; OK. There is that. That certainly is the case. But                  absent that, the whole idea of the context of Planet X as was                  originated and is mostly&hellip; most completely embodied by                  the zetatalk thing&hellip; that has never come out of the disinfo                  bin in our SpaceGoatFarts. Now, there&rsquo;s a whole lot&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Now                    what about Nibiru? In other words, are you having problems                  with the choice of language here?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; No no no. Because we&rsquo;ve got it modeled on the                  various different parameters, all the way going back to Sitchin                  and everything. And besides which, he&rsquo;s was a very poor                  linguist and mostly did a lot of bad translations on some stuff. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the best representation of that kind of a model is a couple                  of the scientists out there -- Paul La Voilette who is working                  on the electric universe model etc., and their concept as to                  how these small little intrusions are going to act. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, I&rsquo;m sorry, but we don&rsquo;t show Planet X. We                  also show all kinds of things that are current in pop culture                  as falling in that bin where we don&rsquo;t have an emotional                  archetype that supports them outside of the disinfo category.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.                    When you say you don&rsquo;t have an emotional archetype                  that supports it, is it possible that you&hellip; there is                  a reason why you wouldn&rsquo;t have an emotional archetype?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Sure. There are some artifacts within our processing                  that could certainly occur. I question&hellip; We have these                  debates internally, and I question sometimes whether, for instance,                  we would be able to accurately predict a meteor that would                  come on in and attack the planet, because it&rsquo;s so far                  out in left field, so to speak, that humans wouldn&rsquo;t                  necessarily be cognizant of it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However,                    if we&rsquo;re working on the alternate view of reality,                  that we&rsquo;re all interconnected in the common mind, and                  our minds are impacted by every other mind etc., etc., in a                  giant network, then I don&rsquo;t see how anything in reality <em>could</em> occur                  that could not communicate to that mind. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    fact that I don&rsquo;t particularly have a model shouldn&rsquo;t                  matter that much because it should reveal itself in the language,                  and I shouldn&rsquo;t have to root around and discover what                  that is. Just for instance, I did not have <em>terrorism</em> modeled.                  And words showed up that said<em> military / accident / money                  center / within 85 days of the middle of July.</em> And it                  turned out to be, of course, the attack on the wtc and 911.                  And I didn&rsquo;t have terrorism modeled.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK, but I would counter that by saying because it                  wasn&rsquo;t perpetrated by terrorists.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It doesn&rsquo;t                    matter. Everybody applied the <em>label</em> of terrorism                    to it. So the fact that my people are applying the label                    of Nibiru or Planet X or whatever &hellip; it&rsquo;s applying                    to an underlying context that should show up if in fact that                  were some emergent basis in the fear. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other words, we got a context, again one I had not modeled: <em>electric-driven                    water.</em> And if I&rsquo;d been smart I would have said: <em>Force-driven                    water. Hmm, what kind of force could drive water?</em> And                    then it would have dawned on me: a tsunami. But I never even                    thought about it. I went the other way. I thought: <em>Ooh,                    electricity, storms, giant storms, hurricanes that happen                    at the same time as the earthquake.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, I was wrong about that. Electric-driven water was pretty                  straight-forward, but we did not have any emotional quantifiers                  attached to the word <em>tsunami</em> in our lexicon.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK.                    Now I see you reference <em>hyper-dimensional                    physics,</em> though, rather repeatedly in your documents                    here.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Correct.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; And I think that&rsquo;s really interesting. So,                  are you able to talk about things like how that impacts what&rsquo;s                  gonna be happening to us as we move into the galactic center?                  And what&rsquo;s going on with, for example, the Face on Mars,                  the pyramids, 19.5, things that Hoagland talks about, for example?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Sure, and actually that developed because&hellip; A                  few years back I started another thing, that the entities were                  shifting around and we had to do some things&hellip; Like,                  we had this big entity which we called <em>Bushco</em>, which                  was the amalgamation of the Bush Administration and the Corporatocracy.&nbsp; And                  it severed. And it came into the <em>Bushistas</em> and then                  in the markets etc. So the data changes on us enough to force                  us to look at this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And a few                    years back we started getting all this Unknown Energies from                    Space business. We didn&rsquo;t really have a bin to throw                  it in. It was tucked into the Terror entity, or sometimes it                  would show up in the GlobalPop or the AmericaPop subsections:                  subsets-science, subsets-government, etc., etc.&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we&rsquo;d                    get all these repeated bits of information that appeared                    like they all wanted to go together. So we decided: <em>OK,                  let&rsquo;s create a bin</em>. And we called it the SpaceGoatFarts. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And because                    it was gonna be in that area that we&rsquo;d hold                  all of our <em>unknown</em> and <em>officially-denied</em> space-based,                  but also interdimensional, also, you know, basically hyper-dimensional,                  and all of this kind of stuff. As that data-set&hellip; As                  that entity has grown over time and pulled in more and more                  sets of data on its own, it&rsquo;s forced us to examine this                  kind of stuff and to follow some of these rather intriguing                  subjects, like hyper-dimensionality. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, I                    have to say that I&rsquo;m aware of all of this about                  electricity since way back when. I knew about the electric                  model before even getting into the work I&rsquo;m in now. And                  I&rsquo;m also an aficionado of Buckminster Fuller&rsquo;s                  work that he did through synergetics. So a lot of this stuff                  that is being expressed at the level of hyper-dimensional physics                  has been out there in various different places on our planet                  in various different formats and you could have gone out and                  picked up little bits and pieces from here and there. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What&rsquo;s                    interesting is how many people have done just that and are                    putting them all together. And then we have to ask ourselves: <em>Why are they being motivated to do it now?</em> Well                  probably because we need to know about it now.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.                    And then one last question and I&rsquo;ll let you go                  because I know this has gotten quite long. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m fine, we can chat all night. I&rsquo;ve                  got coffee.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Really? OK. There&rsquo;s                    a lot of talk about going from the third to the fourth to                    the fifth dimension -- the actual Earth itself -- as a result                    of the transformations that are happening on the planet.                  Have you been getting information about that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; We may be. I have to be somewhat vague because, again,                  it&rsquo;s an issue of do we have it modeled correctly? In                  our SpaceGoatFarts entity, we have a subset called <em>unknown</em> and                  within that we have another subset called <em>energy,</em> and                  it splits off into these various different areas. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There appears                    to be a whole lot of information about extra energy coming                    in from space. The data-sets might be reflecting major changes                    at levels that might go down to what we call the ESR or the                    Electron Spin Resonance. So, who knows what that&rsquo;s                  gonna cause? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Would humans                    be able to adequately project the result of something like                    the change in the electron spin resonance level across the                    whole of the solar system if we get into some of these energetic                    areas, in a way that we could meaningfully pick up? I don&rsquo;t know. We might be getting some hints that there&rsquo;s                  some huge changes along that level coming up. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for                    popping into the fourth dimension&hellip; the fourth                  density or something, we don&rsquo;t have any words specifically                  towards that, other than we&rsquo;re picking up some of those                  that are coming from those people that are promulgating that                  idea out there. We&rsquo;re not picking up any of the archetypes                  that I would suspect should arise. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that                  we won&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re just not at this moment.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK,                    because, for example, it seems to me that maybe an archetype                  symbol would be the spiral.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C:&nbsp; [long pause] Yeah, but that&rsquo;s all tied up in                  the idea of the eschaton and the singularity and so on. It&rsquo;d                  be awful hard to separate that from those previous contexts                  and apply it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We do see                    a whole&hellip; We do see mass kinds of changes                  coming in at various different levels that are affecting the                  data at unexpected places. And they&rsquo;re pointing to things                  like, as I say, the pineal gland. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in                    this coming report we&rsquo;re gonna write about fluoride                  because there&rsquo;s gonna be a huge emotional wave building                  in 2009 about the damage that was done to people as a result                  of fluoride and its interaction with the pineal gland. And                  a lot of people are gonna be very, very, very upset because                  they will feel that something has been stolen from them. And                  I think that what they&rsquo;re going to be feeling is that                  the potential or capacity for a better expression of humanity                  has been stolen from them, once they know certain information.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Wow. OK, well I&rsquo;m&hellip; Thank you. This has                  been really fascinating.
