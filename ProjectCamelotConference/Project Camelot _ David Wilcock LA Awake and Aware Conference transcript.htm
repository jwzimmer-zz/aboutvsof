KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  David Wilcock is a really stellar individual, as
everyone here knows, and we thank him very much for being who he is
and for putting himself in such a dedicated place, to serve humanity
with his life. We honor him for that and we stand right at his side.
<br><br>

That
doesn't mean we agree on everything, or how it will roll out, or this
or that, but in the main we agree. All right? And we're very happy to
present him here today. David Wilcock.
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

DAVID
WILCOCK (DW):  Thank you. Thank you, Kerry. All right, we do have a
lot of material to cover; we don't have a lot of time. How many
people here need a bathroom break, or are you ready to just keep
going?
<br><br>

AUDIENCE:
 Go, go.
<br><br>

DW:
 Just go? All right. Now, you video guys, do you need me to wear a
Lavalier mic for the video recording? Or, you're okay? All right.
<br><br>

The other
thing is, if you guys are doing this live streaming, can you cut back
and forth between my slides and my face as it's going out live? Can
you do that? Okay. Because there is going to be a lot of slides and
they will go fairly quickly.
<br><br>

Okay,
now we've gotten the business taken care of, let's get down to the
real work, which is this subject of 2012.

<br><br>

What I
will be proposing tonight is definitely not your typical approach to
2012.

<br><br>

It
is very important to understand on an intrinsic level that what we
are dealing with is not channeling, it is not Mayan prophecy, it is
not ancient religious teaching, it is not speculation and it is not
psychic.
<br><br>

It
does not require anything except the exacting measurements of the
scientific process and the insight to be able to take information
that has already been put out there by NASA, by mainstream scientists
studying the mysteries of what it means to be a biological life form,
the mysteries of the Solar System, the mysteries of energy and
matter, and how does matter and energy truly function.
<br><br>

When you
start looking at the hidden mysteries of science, which are already
out there now, you find out that the human species is undergoing a
massive evolutionary process right now. And I'm going to prove that
to you.

<br><br>

I'm
going to prove to you that the nature of this evolutionary process
fundamentally rewrites DNA and biological life to such an extreme
that within one generation &ndash; I will show you the proof in this
presentation &ndash; that a creature can give birth to something that
becomes an entirely different species than the creature whose womb it
came out of...

<br><br>

...and
that there is nothing more that needs to be done to create that
energetic change but to simply zap the embryo with a
light wave that comes from another
embryo that has the genetic pattern that you wish to transfer.
<br><br>

The only
way that this makes any sense is to begin seeing DNA as susceptible
to quantum wave effects.
<br><br>

You
may have seen, most of you have probably seen <I>2012
Enigma,</I> which is a video of mine
that I'm proud to say was number one most viewed on Google, December
1st of last year.
<br><br>

The
reason why it got that way is because the information has rocked the
Internet. It has led to my getting the starring position on a Syfy
documentary coming out in November, on Syfy Network.

<br><br>

It's led
to Penguin contacting me to write a book based on the video, one of
the biggest publishing companies out there.
<br><br>

It
has led to my working with -- I'm going to say this now publicly --
Jim Hart, who wrote the movie <I>Contact</I>
with Jodie Foster. That is our screenwriter.
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

Thank
you. I'm working on <I>Wanderer
Awakening</I>, which is the album cover
you see here in the slide, with the nine-time Grammy-winning
musician, Larry Seyer.
<br><br>

The
reason why all this big talent and why all this attention is being
focused here is not because I may have been somebody else in another
lifetime. It's not because I have done psychic readings. It's not
because I put prophecies on the Internet that later were shown to
come true.
<br><br>

The
biggest thing that I bring to the planet right now is to simply look
at ancient prophecies that we know to exist, that we can document in
great detail, and to then give a scientific framework for these
prophecies on such an advanced level that we're looking at things in
an entirely different way.
<br><br>

So,
let's get back to <I>2012 Enigma</I>
for a minute. Most of you have seen that video. You may remember that
I discuss an experiment that was conducted in which a tiny, what's
called a buckyball, was shot through a grating. The grating is 100
nanometers wide. The buckyball itself is only about one or two
nanometers wide. It goes through the grating and it turns into a
wave.
<br><br>

The
buckyball itself, which is supposed to be a macroscopic object, goes
through this little slit, and for whatever reason, it turns into a
non-local wave.
<br><br>

Now
what does <I>quantum non-locality</I>
really mean? It means that you don't know where the wave is in space.
You also don't know where the wave is in time.
<br><br>

Quantum
non-locality shows that the more you try to find out where it is in
time, the less you can find it in space; the more you try to find out
where it is in space, the less you can find it in time.
<br><br>

If
you look at the quantum physics equations, it's well known in quantum
mechanics that the time has to be both backwards / forwards &ndash;
it has to be completely non-linear in the traditional sense.
<br><br>

Albert
Einstein has given us the Theory of Relativity. The Theory of
Relativity is going to tell you that when you travel through space;
it's not empty space. What did Einstein call space? He didn't call it
space, he called it space-time.
<br><br>

The
reason why he called it space-time is that he said you're moving
through something that makes time start running faster as you go
through space. So you could literally be inside a spaceship, leave
the Earth for two weeks flying at the speed of light, come back, and
it's 500 years later.
<br><br>

We
know that this has been proven. It actually was done on jumbo jets
flying at the highest altitude they could, where they had little
watches on them, or little radioactive time-keeping devices, and they
found very subtle, but definite changes in the speed of time, just
based on the velocity of a jet going around Earth orbit.
<br><br>

So,
imagine what happens when you go up towards light speed. Now, this is
a proven principle in physics: As you move through space, you're also
moving through the so-called time fabric, the space-time fabric, as
Einstein called it.
<br><br>

There
was a mistake that Einstein made in his scientific understanding of
space-time. It may be a mistake, or it may be that he figured it out
and he didn't want to talk about what he discovered.

<br><br>

In
the Einstein Relativity Theory, it is assumed that the only direction
you can move is into the future &ndash; if it's space-time, the time
dimension is only one dimensional.

<br><br>

But,
we actually now know from the physics of Dewey Larson, which you'll
also see on my 2012 video, that the whole way that the quantum world
is being built is that there is a domain in which time as we think of
it is three dimensional, and space as we think of it is one
dimensional.
<br><br>

That
world is constantly interchanging energy back and forth with
space-time. We call it <I>time-space</I>
over there. It is <I>space-time</I>
over here.

<br><br>

So,
this time-space realm over there is sending energy into space-time
and it's pinging back and forth &ndash; and that is what creates
matter.
<br><br>

The
reason why this is important is that if you can get over into
time-space, then you can actually travel a physical distance and
return to space-time, and you have now time-traveled... and it is not
just the future. You can actually travel into the past.
<br><br>

If
you're traveling in the direction that the Earth is rotating, and you
travel ahead of where the Earth was rotating when you left, you're
going to end up in the future, because you now re-emerge in
space-time ahead of where the Earth was on its timeline when you
left.
<br><br>

If
you travel west, that's into the past. East is the future, west is
the past. And again, it's going to sound ridiculous and for those who
are uneducated, they'll blast me on the Internet and say that I'm
full of it.
<br><br>

But,
the fact of the matter is, this is very much provable stuff. I've had
people write me and say that the science in <I>2012
Enigma</I> is ridiculous.

<br><br>

Well,
go to <U><A HREF="https://www.reciprocalsystem.com/" target="_blank">www.reciprocalsystem.com</A></U>.
Read Dewey Larson's books because there are several of them, and find
out for yourself how he breaks down every single problem in quantum
mechanics and shows you've got to have three-dimensional time.
<br><br>

So
all we're saying is, if you can get over into <I>time-space,</I>
it's going to look like everything does here, because every atom and
molecule around me right now is here because it is exchanging with
time-space. So there is time-space stuff in every place around me.
<br><br>

That
means all this stuff exists as a parallel structure in a parallel
universe, and when you go over there, it becomes your three
dimensions of space. It's going to look the same because the energy
of it is the same energy that is here in <I>space-time.</I>
<br><br>

Now,
here is where it gets really confusing, if it's not already
confusing. [laughter]
<br><br>

See, in my
mind, I don't have to worry about this stuff. It comes in very
naturally.
<br><br>

You
actually have an <I>energetic pair</I>
to your physical body which is in time-space, okay? But, there are
all these bonuses that your energy body has in time-space that your
physical body doesn't have here.
<br><br>

What I'm
literally telling you is that every nook and cranny, every little
funny fold of your brain exists as a parallel energetic structure
that is coupled with the cells in your brain, that interfaces with
the cells in your brain, that interfaces with every molecule of DNA
in your body.
<br><br>

That is
where ALL thought processes are actually occurring. They're not
occurring in your nervous system at all in terms of intellect.
<br><br>

The body
does produce certain forms of thought. You have an autonomic nervous
system. You have a cerebellum that keeps you from falling over, makes
sure that you're balanced by working with the fluid in the chamber of
your ear, the cochlea.
<br><br>

You have
all of the basic systems that are going to make sure that your heart
is beating, that your lungs are breathing, that your eyes are not
taking in all the information peripherally so that you can focus on
what you're looking at.
<br><br>

You
have a screening mechanism that is going to screen out background
noise so that, if there is television on and somebody is talking to
you, you're going to listen to them talking and not hear the
television. You're not going to hear all the input and weigh it the
same.
<br><br>

Those
types of things are biologically-driven systems. The body makes those
thoughts for you.
<br><br>

All
of the actual intellect, all of the actual thinking that you're going
to be doing in your mind is not in the body at all. You have a
parallel body, a parallel brain, a parallel nervous system that is an
energetic nervous system.

<br><br>

But,
it doesn't look like your physical body because your physical body
doesn't have billions and billions of strings coming out of it. It
doesn't have an instantaneous energetic connection that you can
visibly see to everything else in its environment.
<br><br>

What
I'm asking you to visualize as strings is actually simply an energy
field. In time-space, you are part of that energy field and your mind
is not simply that which is created within your own energy field. It
very much is affected by all these other things that are around you,
including the thoughts of other people.
<br><br>

The
very fascinating case of Norman Mailer, the famous novelist who wrote
a novel called <I>Barbary Shore</I>...
in this novel, he starts out writing about one main character and
gradually changes the novel to write about a Russian spy. The Russian
spy becomes the focus of the entire novel. He goes into great detail.
<br><br>

Within
the same week that he finishes <I>Barbary
Shore</I>, a Russian spy was arrested in
his same building that he was living in &ndash; just up the stairs
and down the hallway.
<br><br>

Now, does
this mean there was a conduit that was going through the air vent so
that he could hear what this guy was saying? Of course not.
<br><br>

What
it does mean, though, is that that man was so emotionally charged
because he was at the end of his rope and he knew he was going to get
caught, that his mind was sending out signals. And Norman Mailer's
mind is an energetic phenomenon which is sensitive to its
environment, and picked up the signals that were being generated.
<br><br>

Now,
again, I talked about the experiment where buckyballs are shot
through a hundred-nanometer grate, a little tiny slit. They turn into
a wave just by hitting the grate. It's like it makes them like flip
inside out and go from space-time, where they're a particle, into
time-space.
<br><br>

That
solid particle, which has 120 atoms in it... it's not just like some
tiny little thing. It's a ball, it's got structure, it's got form,
it's got shape. It literally popped out of our space-time entirely.

<br><br>

It
flipped over into a realm where time is three dimensional, space is
one dimensional, and it smears out &ndash; it's partly in the past,
it's partly in the present, it's partly in the future. In that state
it looks like a wave, because you can't measure where everything is
anymore.

<br><br>

So,
now get a load of this. The DNA molecule is only slightly wider than
a buckyball. Which means the DNA molecule is also subject to quantum
effects in which the molecules within your DNA are phasing between
being here in space-time and being in time-space, where they actually
are stretched out through linear time; and they're sensitive to all
the other energy fields around them.
<br><br>

Now
again, this is science. All we're doing is we're starting with
Einstein's Relativity. We're saying that as you move through space,
you move through time. The faster you move through space, the faster
you're traveling through time.
<br><br>

In
time-space you can move not just in the future, but into the past as
well, depending on what direction you're traveling.
<br><br>

The
Russians have identified the &ldquo;time field&rdquo;, which means
that if you speed up the time field in a small area, time will run
faster or slower in that area compared to everything else around it.
They've got lots of experiments with little wrist watches and stuff
where they put them in the time field and the time field makes it
speed up or slow down.
<br><br>

Now,
pyramids are one of those things that will make those watches change
speed, so a pyramid is an actual symbol of something that will cause
change to occur.
<br><br>

The
pyramid is a symbol, but it's also a technology &ndash; it's also a
machine.

<br><br>

The symbol
of the pyramid is that which is reaching up. It's something that's
reaching for the heavens. It represents geometry and there is
geometry that makes this energy field of the time field I'm talking
about function. It's all based on geometry, which is more complex
than what we're going to do in this presentation.
<br><br>

The
time field is something which not only affects the passage of linear
time; it also affects the health of your body. The more of this time
field that's flowing through your body, the healthier you're going to
be, and paradoxically, the slower you're going to age.
<br><br>

It's when
the flow of the time field stops that you move out of eternity, that
you move out of timelessness. It's when time stops flowing through
you that you stop being an eternal being and you begin aging.
<br><br>

Remember
that scientific study that Deepak Chopra talked about in <I>Ageless
Body, Timeless Mind</I> where he gets a
bunch of elderly people and he puts them in a room where it has the
magazines of 40 years ago. It has the radio broadcasts, it has all
the furniture, everything.
<br><br>

What
he found was that within a very short period of time, all these
people had a remarkable turn-around where they started to reverse
aging. They actually started getting younger in a way that is
molecularly, biologically provable. That's because the time field
started flowing again. They started to have hope.
<br><br>

The time
field is that which gives you inspiration. If you want to know
whether the time field is really flowing through you or not, you can
tell because you will be in a state of uplifting gratitude and
positive emotion.
<br><br>

It
is a scientific fact that the more that your mind goes into that
state of resonance, of positive attitude, of fearlessness, of
courage, you are causing time to flow through you faster, which means
you have the power of eternity at your fingertips, which means you
are at the forefront of the human evolutionary process.
<br><br>

But,
this is not something that only relies upon your ingenuity and your
dedication to a spiritual path. It is something that is being done
for you by forces that are very mysterious, because they are much
greater than what you would normally think of as your conscious mind.
<br><br>

You
want to talk about the monolith in <I>2001</I>
and how mysterious that was? That's not even the beginning of what
we're talking about now.
<br><br>

This
big stone slab shows up and all of a sudden, all those cavemen learn
how to use tools, and they can kill each other now, and they become
the dominant species.

<br><br>

Then,
at the point where the movie goes into the present, the monolith
shows up on the Moon. Commander David Bowman, at the end of the
movie, ends up becoming the new Adam, the new species of humanity,
after he goes through a stargate.
<br><br>

There's
a lot of things that are known on the inside and this stuff is not a
secret. It is not a secret. Even though it has been kept secret, it
has been attempted to be kept secret, it is not secret.
<br><br>

All
of the information we need is already here so that we can
definitively understand that what is happening to the Earth is a
naturally-occurring process. It is a sacred process motivated by
forces of intelligence that would stagger the imagination.
<br><br>

Back
in the old days, you had a LAN system in which a computer was just a
monitor and a typewriter. You plugged it up to one central computer
and everybody's little dummy terminal, as it was called, was plugged
into that one computer.
<br><br>

On some
level, each of us is the dummy terminal. We appear to be separate, we
appear to be an identity that has an ego, that has a body, and we
identify with the body.
<br><br>

On some
grander level, the body is merely a projection. It's like if you have
a prism and light is going through the prism, and as it rotates you
see these rainbows around the room.
<br><br>

Each one
of you is one of those rainbows but would you say each of those
rainbows are each an individual generator of light? No. The light is
generated by whatever is striking the prism. Those individual pieces
of rainbow light are just the reflections of the one light that
strikes the prism.
<br><br>

If
you want to really get into the esoteric science and understand what
the ancient prophecies are telling us and why it is so relevant to
what you're going to hear in this talk, try to vibe into the fact
that the entire manifest universe, that matter and energy itself, are
but reflections of this one singular light. That all visibility in
the universe, everything we can measure, is a reflection into what we
think is space and what we think is time.
<br><br>

But when
you start really understanding what time is, you realize you can go
whatever direction you want - forwards, backwards and sideways.

<br><br>

When you
understand space, you realize that space doesn't pose any obstacle if
you can pop through to time-space, back and forth from space-time to
time-space.
<br><br>

You can
wormhole yourself, or portal yourself, or whatever they want to call
it, from any point in the universe to any other, instantaneously.
That is how it's done, because there is no actual location.
<br><br>

Location
is an illusion which is based on the rules of the road, so that we
have one Intelligent Super-Being that has wanted to experience
multiplicity; It has wanted to experience separation, so that It can
reunify.
<br><br>

In
terms of how that functions in our Galaxy, the Galaxy is generating
intelligent waves, which you're going to see the proof for in this
presentation, and those waves upgrade the speed of this time field or
of what I call &ldquo;the source field&rdquo;.

<br><br>

The speed
of vibration of the source field is going up.
<br><br>

If
that speed represents how well you think, it's no different than you
upgrading your computer and going from this ridiculously bad
processor, where you could barely even get any of your websites to
load because it takes so long, and getting this really fast machine
where now every page, POOF! [blows into microphone]
<br><br>

Sorry
about that. [laughter] She almost jumped right out of her seat. I'll
try to do that a little more delicately next time.
<br><br>

Okay.
So, you broke me out of my trance now. Now, I've got to actually talk
from the ego: [switches to fake accent] How is it going, man?
[laughter] What the hell was I talking about?
<br><br>

[back
to himself] All right, let's see, we've got to the get the download
back in play here.
<br><br>

When
we understand that this energy field is part of the Galaxy, that the
Galaxy is a conscious being, the Galaxy has energy that must be
conscious. The energy that is in the entire universe must be
conscious and it must create life.
<br><br>

Life
is the Divine <I>imprimatur</I>
of all energy in the universe. All energy in the universe is built to
create life.
<br><br>

The
physicists call this the &quot;Goldilocks Principle&quot; and they
don't even have a clue as to how far the Goldilocks Principle goes &ndash;
it's not too hot, it's not too cold, it's just right.

<br><br>

That's
what they're talking about in terms of planets like ours and how we
have just the right amount of oxygen, just the right amount of water,
just the right temperature, all these things are perfect.
<br><br>

It's not
an accident. Life on Earth is not some random little thing that only
happens once in the history of the cosmos. Life on Earth is actually
programmed to be here.
<br><br>

We
have to get rid of this idea that... Well, we don't <I>have
to</I>. I try not to use <I>must</I>
and <I>have to,</I>
because those are very strong words.
<br><br>

It
would be beneficial to learn that there are forces out there much
greater than the human intellect, much greater than the ego, much
greater than the body.

<br><br>

There
are forms of consciousness that could be an entire planet, that could
be the Sun, that could be the Galaxy, which is really nothing more
than a bunch of suns and planets in a big cluster.
<br><br>

Well, we
can prove that that's going on. So I'm going to start showing you
some things here.
<br><br>

The
first criticism that anyone will have when you go into a 2012
discussion is they say, <I>Well, nothing
is really that different. Everything's the same.</I>
<br><br>

[slide:
Is This Just Another &ldquo;Ordinary&rdquo; Time in History?]
<br><br>

<I>We're
pretty much doing the same thing now that we've always been doing. We
get a little bit of progress here, a little bit of progress there,
but nothing is going on right now. There's nothing unique or special
about this time in history.</I>
<br><br>

I beg to
differ.
<br><br>

This is a
picture that you're going to see from the fires in Australia.
<br><br>

[slide:
picture of a Koala Bear drinking water from a small water bottle held
by a fireman, with one paw in the hand of the fireman]
<br><br>

You
may not think of this, but Koalas in the wild are actually quite
dangerous. They'll claw you and scratch you; they'll attack viciously
to protect their home.
<br><br>

But
when it comes to these Earth changes, this Koala was more than
willing to accept nourishment and love from a human. A wild Koala.
He's not scratching, he's not attacking.
<br><br>

Now this
is the thing that people don't seem to understand. The universe is
built to deliver the experiences that are already happening.

<br><br>

The
universe is not a cosmic comforter that hands you a lollipop when you
don't love yourself and says, <I>Oh, I'm
just going to just send you all these people who are going to love
you because you don't love yourself</I>;
and, <I>Oh, I'm sorry you don't love
yourself. Let me send you loving people.</I>
<br><br>

<I>[laughs]</I>
Is that how it works? What happens to you when don't love yourself?
What does the universe send to you? Does it send you a lollipop?
<br><br>

<I>Hey,
look at that. That person doesn't love himself, that person doesn't
have a high opinion of himself. I have a puppet now, I can manipulate
that puppet. I can make that person do what I want because they are
too afraid to go against me. They want to be polite. They have such a
low self esteem that if I tell them something that I want them to do,
they're not going to want to upset me.</I>
<br><br>

So,
what the universe actually does is, that if you have a weakness, if
you have something you don't like, the universe says, <I>Oh,
you don't like that. Well, here, have some more. Have some more.</I>
<br><br>

Until
you get to the point that you simply accept experience, and accept
yourself. And when you learn to accept yourself, you will not be
manipulated because you will decide that it's better to preserve your
sovereignty than be manipulated by someone else.
<br><br>

You will
decide that your state of mind, being positive and uplifting, is a
better state for you to be in than the state you're going to have to
go through temporarily to really piss somebody off when they're
trying to manipulate you.

<br><br>

Because
they're going to take it personally, they're going to get angry;
they're going to throw hate at you. That's what they do. That's what
these types of people do.
<br><br>

Now,
we're not judging those people, except insofar as that they are in
confusion. They are living in a confusion that makes them think that
the body is who they are and they are trying to do things to comfort
the body, at your expense.
<br><br>

This
is the meme that's going on, on the entire planet. That's what a lot
of these talks that you've been hearing are about. We are talking
about how much corruption and greed and rottenness has festered into
the society and the structure of civilization on Earth.

<br><br>

In
the governments, in the militaries and the corporations, in the
school systems, in the financial systems -- throughout everything
there is this corruption, this molding that has occurred.
<br><br>

Let's get
out of the idea that this is a victim consciousness that we're going
through. That's what I'd recommend.
<br><br>

You
do what you want, but this is how I've decided to live: <I>I'm
not going to be anybody's victim. I'm not going to be anybody's
slave. </I>

<br><br>

I claim
and I ask you with me right now, by your applause, to claim your
freedom and your sovereignty in this moment. Let's have a hand for
that.
<br><br>

[applause/
hoots/ whistles] All right!
<br><br>

If
you can claim your freedom of positivity, your freedom from fear,
that is the most threatening thing to the negative controllers in
this world, because this is a frequency war.

<br><br>

The
one thing they don't want you to have is a positive, loving feeling
in your day-to-day lives; if they can keep you thinking that you're
at the brink of destruction, that nuclear missiles are ready to
incinerate the Earth, that the economy is ready to collapse, that
your government is ready to herd you off into concentration camps.

<br><br>

They've
whipped up this fever to such an extent that people are bringing
armed weapons to gatherings where the President is because now Fox
News wants you to think that Obama is the same old thing.
<br><br>

I
don't care if that is what you believe or not, but any time that Fox
News is telling me something is true, I'm inclined to think it's not
true, based on their past history. Can I get an &quot;Amen&quot; on
that?
<br><br>

[applause/
hoots]

<br><br>

It's
a little bit disturbing when you start watching Bill O'Reilly and
Glenn Beck and they're saying exactly the same things as all your
favorite conspiracy websites. That's not good, that's not what we
want, because Fox is a corporate entity. It is a propaganda organ.
<br><br>

It's also
important to understand that many of the conspiracy sites have been
seeded with propaganda. These are not independent bloggers that are
actually trying to raise money and do an honest living. These are
people that are funded by the Pentagon and the NSA. We've had
extensive discussions with people about this, who are insiders.
<br><br>

So
what's happening now is that because, as a planet, we have not loved
ourselves &ndash; we have been stuck in this self-loathing and this
self-condemnation and this fear of our own potential, this fear of
our power &ndash; the universe has not sent us these majestic,
loving, cosmic leaders who are all-knowing and all-powerful and can
be trusted with the warmth and innocence of a young child.

<br><br>

They
have sent us vicious killers who will do nothing but spare no expense
to rape us, to steal every cent of our money. That's what happens in
the universe, but it only happens until you don't need the lesson.
<br><br>

If you
learn to love yourself, do those negative people still get fixated
into your life to such an extent that that's all you ever have? No.
<br><br>

If
you're one of these people who has been through self-loathing and
moved into a positive self-concept and self-esteem, if you have
learned the power of &quot;No&quot;, as opposed to the power of
&ldquo;Now&rdquo;, and you can say &quot;No&quot; to somebody trying
to manipulate you, then all of sudden, you're not shackled to this
feeling of obligation to someone who is being grotesquely unfair.
<br><br>

You
now have the wherewithal to speak your mind, to say your piece, to
get your needs met, even if it means that it's going to upset
someone. Because if someone has denied you the respect and the
sovereignty and love that you deserve as a perfect child of God, then
you deserve to protect yourself from that person.
<br><br>

You
deserve to love yourself enough that you claim your right to exist.
<br><br>

The
universe sees that you've learned your lesson. Now, the people that
would have taken away your freedom, and would have taken away your
sovereignty, can no longer do so, because even one flicker of light
in the darkness is enough to show you the layout of the room.
<br><br>

We've had
enough of that now, that there is a massive awakening going on.
<br><br>

Project
Camelot &ndash; and I was a part of this &ndash; happened to get
involved in the center of this swine flu vaccination conspiracy. We
had a situation unfold onstage in Z&uuml;rich between myself and
another witness who was arguing in favor of vaccinations and is
actually a former operative for Majestic, which is the UFO working
group arm of the neoconservative Republican New World Order faction
of the world elite.

<br><br>

So,
he's telling you: <I>You should get the
vaccine</I>. Now, granted, there is a
great deal of science to suggest that vaccines do confer immunity. We
are not disagreeing with that.
<br><br>

But
we are also considering the testimony of people like Jane
Burgermeister, a well-known mainstream journalist who happened to go
alternative when she started to find out that Baxter Pharmaceuticals,
as you all know, had released a vaccine and -- thank God -- these
people in Norway injected it into some rats
before they gave it to people, and the rats
all got bird flu and died.
<br><br>

<I>Oops!
How did that happen?</I> [giggles for
effect] <I>I don't know how that
happened. Did we do that? No, of course not.</I>
<br><br>

So
look, you also have people in the government who are not high enough
to know that this swine flu thing might have been manufactured and
they have a very legitimate concern about the swine flu.

<br><br>

It's
being kept secret, but they do believe that this could mutate like it
did in 1918, which, you get sick the first time it's not that bad,
but when you get sick the second time and everybody is dying --
millions of people are dying. That's the theory.
<br><br>

Let's
bear in mind that in 1918 the world was nowhere near as civilized as
it is now. Sanitation was much less. In order for you to have any of
these flu, regardless of what they
are... get your health down in a negative way, your immune system has
to be depleted.
<br><br>

What's the
biggest thing in this new science I'm going to teach you about that
depletes your immune system? NEGATIVE THOUGHTS!
<br><br>

So,
if they can keep you in fear, which means that you hate the
government, you hate the President, you hate what's happening to your
kids in school, you hate the economy, you hate the Federal Reserve.
If you're angry and you're fearful all the time, and then they stick
out a little virus, guess what happens to you? You get the virus.
<br><br>

A
virus is a frequency-based entity. As you see in my <I>2012
Enigma</I> video, polio, rubella, all
these various viruses have geometric structure, which is wave
particle structure. Geometry can flip around into the time field and
become a wave.
<br><br>

Budakovski,
which you're going to see in this presentation, proved that the wave
structure of a disease is enough to infect healthy tissue in a
hermetically sealed container. You can take the wave structure of a
disease, zap it through a hermetically sealed container, and have
those cells inside the container catch the disease.
<br><br>

A
disease is a disease of the mind which has, as its medium of
transference, the consciousness field. That's how you get sick. It's
by going out of integrity. The nutritional component is secondary to
that.
<br><br>

When
you're in an area where everybody is depressed because their living
conditions are very difficult, they're going to get sick a lot more,
because they're so negative.
<br><br>

So,
I ask you this, if you can respect yourself enough to no longer let
these people into your life on a personal level, is there a Hundredth
Monkey effect that happens to the planet? Of course. Of course!
That's what's happening right now.
<br><br>

What I
said on this panel last night, what I said on the radio show that I
just did with Project Camelot on Thursday, what I'm preparing to say
on my website, is that we are now at a point where we have graduated.
<br><br>

I was told
this a year ago. I was actually starting to be told this two years
ago. It's now happened.
<br><br>

We have
graduated from the need to have the New World Order running the show.
It's over. It's going to be over within less than a year.
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

I'm not
trying to be psychic. I'm talking in facts. I'm talking about the
simple fact that you cannot lie to people who know the truth.
<br><br>

What does
a lie require to exist? It requires an absence of information. It
requires you not knowing that it's a lie. Because if you're being
lied to and you know that it's a lie, then it's not a lie.
<br><br>

It becomes
an obvious, ridiculous gaff that this person is making. It becomes a
situation that can be remedied because you can start laughing when
that person tells you a lie. Because you know the truth.
<br><br>

We
are watching the derivatives system, the Ponzi scheme and
international bankers being ripped apart because the other countries
are tired of playing the game. They now have more economic power than
the old European white men that run the New World Order and the
Illuminati &ndash; they no longer have the leverage to be able to do
what they are doing.
<br><br>

What I
propose to you on an even more intrinsic level is that this is all
something that appears to be happening as a result of natural
progressions of events.

<br><br>

But
on another level, it is an energetic phenomenon which is being
programmed to occur by a movement into a higher energetic frequency.
That frequency is making us more present with ourselves.

<br><br>

The best
thing you can do for the planet, the best thing you can do to save
the children, to avoid the swine flu, to protect yourself and your
finances, and to make a better world for future generations, is to
stay in that state of positive, uplifting peace and gratitude. Can I
get an &quot;Amen&quot; on that?
<br><br>

[applause]
Thank you.
<br><br>

And I
don't profess that I'm the guy you go to for the answers. You can
send me your emails. I'm happy to read them. I read all my emails.
<br><br>

But
this is something that each of us are doing. I've only identified an
effect that is happening to everyone. If you want to go religious for
a minute, the Second Coming of the Christ, or the Messianic return,
is something that is happening to everyone.
<br><br>

I
was talking to Jordan [Maxwell] over dinner with Bill and Kerry the
other night, and he was telling me that if you really go back into
the original Old Testament documentation, that the Messianic figure
is not one person. It represents this change into a whole new way of
being.
<br><br>

So,
now he's got me convinced that I've got to go looking for that data
myself. He has reason to believe it's true, and I'm sure he's right,
but I need to find my own facts. I don't wait for somebody else to
come and teach me something. If I hear something that I like, I go
look and I find out for myself.
<br><br>

I
was told from my own guidance, which is dreams and visions and
prophetic information, that there was going to be a great change
happening to the Earth and the Solar System. I didn't just nod my
head like a subservient slave to some Higher Power and say, <I>Yes,
you're right, You're right, oh lovely master. I will do what you say.</I>
<br><br>

I
said, <I>No, I can't believe that.</I>
<br><br>

I
can't believe that the whole world is going to change on an energetic
level that will make what we're in now seem like the most miserable
depression, by comparison. That the life that we have now will become
100 times more harmonious. In which things like instantaneous
telepathy, levitation, telekinesis, healing and flying are so
effortless that it's as easy to do as raising and lowering the
diaphragm to make your lungs breathe. It requires no extra effort.
<br><br>

That
seems to be what's going on. There's all these people that we have in
Earth's history from a variety of cultures - including Jesus. And if
you don't want to believe in Jesus really existing, there's plenty of
other cultures you can go to look for so-called Ascended Masters...
they're out there; guys that have these abilities, guys that do these
amazing things.
<br><br>

All
that represents is somebody who is a little bit farther ahead than
you are... not too much.
<br><br>

We know
that the ETs that are visiting us are almost entirely human. The
widest divergence from a human look that you're ever going to get is
the so-called Gray.
<br><br>

The
majority of humans - and we're getting more and more whistleblowers
coming forward and telling us the same thing: the ETs are our family.
They look like us, they have similar types of voices that we do,
although they may not use them anymore because telepathy works much
better and much faster.
<br><br>

This
<I>[indicating speaking]</I>
is like a dial-up modem. It sucks, okay? <I>[laughter]</I>
If I could telepathically speak to you... PFFT. Sorry. <I>[blows
gently into mic]</I> Foo -- how's that?
<br><br>

If
I could telepathically speak to you and just give you the download,
BOOM, you'd just get the whole thing and I can walk off. <I>Thank
you very much, good night!</I> And I'm
done.
<br><br>

It's
already happening isn't it? I'm giving you holographic plates.
<br><br>

What
do we know about a holographic plate? You cut it up into little
pieces; you shine lasers into each one of those pieces and what
happens? Do you see one side of the hologram? You see the whole
hologram! Just maybe just a little bit dimmer.
<br><br>

So what
I'm doing is I'm giving you all these little pieces which seem to be
very interdisciplinary. I'm talking about diet, I'm talking about
health, I'm talking about politics, I'm talking about science.
<br><br>

But I'm
talking about the same thing. I'm talking about you.
<br><br>

What
is your identity?  What&hellip; Is&hellip; Your&hellip; Identity?

<br><br>

Is
it your body? No. Is it this room around you right now? That's part
of it. Your body is part of it. The people sitting next to you in
this auditorium, or if you're watching this on the Internet, the
computer screen that you're looking at -- that's part of you.
<br><br>

The
chair that's touching your bottom is part of you, it's your identity.
When you walk on the ground, the ground and the Earth is also walking
against you, not just you walking against the ground.
<br><br>

When you
go outside and you see the blue skies, and you see the clouds, and
you see the birds, and you see the trees, and you hear the wind
blowing through the trees, that's you. That's who you are.
<br><br>

Energetically
we can prove that. Energetically we can prove that all the cells in
your body change every seven years. Who you are right now, this body
that you have, even if you have this big nasty wart on your face or
something, that wart has been completely re-done over seven years of
time.
<br><br>

Okay,
fine. What does that mean? That means that the energy that made you
change every seven years flowed through you, but it didn't get stuck
there. It kept on going.
<br><br>

Is
it not true that the air that you're breathing right now as I talk to
you has potentially been shared by every person in human history?
That's pretty nasty if you're a germophobe
person, isn't it? [laughter]
<br><br>

Every
person in the world's history has breathed the air that you're
breathing. It's going around and around and around and around. It may
be getting cleaned, but all the energy is there and you can trace it
back. That can be scientifically proven, easily.
<br><br>

So
what about you? Who are you? Who are you, really? If the energy field
that makes your consciousness is interpenetrated with other peoples'
consciousness, and we can prove that, then who are you?
<br><br>

Are you
just this ego? Are you just this part of yourself that feels like
you're lacking something?
<br><br>

Because
the body needs things to survive. The body needs sanitation. If you
don't shower it for a while, it's going to start smelling pretty
nasty. If you don't go to the bathroom, you're going to get sick and
you'll eventually die.
<br><br>

If
you don't eat something, you're going to starve to death. If you
don't drink something, you're going to dehydrate to death.
<br><br>

The
body is fragile. It can be cut; it can be having broken bones. You
can have hair loss, skin problems.

<br><br>

Everything
can go wrong with the body, and therefore, when the body feels pain,
you feel pain and it seems like your identity is now in jeopardy
because the body is so identified with the identity, we assume our
identity is the body. But we now have the scientific proof that
that's not true.
<br><br>

So
your identity ultimately is the Earth &ndash; <I>The
Gaia Hypothesis</I>, James Lovelock.
<br><br>

Your
identity ultimately is the Sun &ndash; that which created all the
particles and molecules that make you who you are now.

<br><br>

Your
identity is the Galaxy. Your identity is the Universe. The energy
that makes the Universal Mind is you &ndash; it's just in a slower,
holographically fragmented form, like that prism I said is rotating
and all these little rainbows are there. That's all it is, that's all
you are.
<br><br>

But,
that is everything you need to be because that proves that you are
the light, you are the love, you are the One Infinite Creator.

<br><br>

That's
all you ever have been, that's all you ever will be, and that's more
than enough, because what that means is that you have limitless
potential.
<br><br>

There is
nothing special about me. The only thing that is different is that
I'm very dedicated to doing what I'm doing, and I'm getting in touch
with that part of myself that has access to the higher consciousness,
and it makes me more and more an embodiment of who I am.
<br><br>

The
more that you get in touch with the Higher Self, with your true
cosmic identity, the more that you become one of the Living Master
Geniuses on this planet.

<br><br>

If
you had any idea of the scope of what you COULD be if you truly
access your potential, it would floor you because every single one of
us has the potential to be a Messianic figure, to be the savior of
the world.

<br><br>

We all
have that potential and we're all doing it to varying degrees as we
start awakening.
<br><br>

[applause]
Well, thank you.
<br><br>

Look, I
could yak about this all day but we've got a lot of slides to do, so
let's do some slides.
<br><br>

[slide
reads: &ldquo;Interplanetary Climate Change: NASA's Hottest Secret&rdquo;]
<br><br>

The
Galaxy is pumping out these waves of energy, which are now changing
the Solar System, and we're going to talk about that in very concrete
terms. You're going to see all the proof for that.
<br><br>

The
fossil record is undergoing 26-million-year cycles as well as
62-million-year cycles, as you see in this graph here. What's causing
that to happen? All life on Earth spontaneously changing in even
intervals of time?
<br><br>

<I>Oh,
it's got to be some big rock out there that's spinning around.</I>
<br><br>

62
million years is not some big rock. That's like a third of the orbit
of the entire Galaxy, basically. It's about a fourth because the
Galaxy is about a 240-million-year orbit. 62 is about, roughly
speaking, it's a quarter. It might be exactly a quarter... that might
be the point.
<br><br>

What did
the Ancients know, and why must we remember now? What do pyramids
really do? Pyramids are harnessing the source field. We're going to
get into that in a minute.
<br><br>

We know,
and we can prove now, that Atlantean civilization was nothing new.
These pyramids around the world are not something that was built in
conventional history. It was built before then.
<br><br>

Off
the western tip of Cuba, as you see in this map here, at this c
Guanahacabibes - I can't even pronounce
that - the Guanahacabibes Peninsula, right off the tip of that on the
western tip of Cuba; you go a mile down. Well, so it's not quite a
mile, but it's a long ways down under the surface of the ocean and
down there you find a submerged city, as this link says on BBC News.
<br><br>

This
is the only officially-released side scan sonar photograph of what
was actually seen down there. Does that look like random pieces of
sand on the sea floor? No!
<br><br>

This
is what it actually looks like if you reconstruct it in a computer.
That's a computer graphic rendering of what you just saw right here.
Is everybody with me? That's not something that just showed up as a
result of random geologic processes. That's a human-built structure.
<br><br>

This area
could not have been above the ground, and above sea level, prior to
11,000 years ago.
<br><br>

Paulina
Zelitsky is here in a cave in Cuba,
which used to be the Atlantean highlands, looking at inscriptions on
the cave wall. They're precisely the same as inscriptions that they
saw being painted on the walls of these submerged cities that they
sent submersible submarines probes into.
<br><br>

What
you're seeing here is a diagram of the energy fields in the Solar
System which are, of course, concentric rings emanating out from the
center of the Sun.
<br><br>

They also
saw these cross formations painted on inscriptions in these submerged
cities.
<br><br>

Now
here is the only other photograph that she's ever released. This is a
still-frame from a much longer film where she is flying a submersible
through this city.
<br><br>

What do
you see in the window of her monitor? Would you like to see it more
up close?
<br><br>

That's not
just a little piece of sand on the bottom of the ocean. That is a
pyramid. Would you like to see a pyramid in Egypt that it looks very
similar to?
<br><br>

Here
we go. This is called the Bent Pyramid of Dahshur, on the right. It's
almost identical to what you see on the left, and that is submerged
off the western tip of Cuba.
<br><br>

It's down
there right now. What are we doing by not going and looking at it?
<br><br>

Why
did they sell this story to <I>National
Geographic</I> and it just so happened
to never make it out in 2003? <I>National
Geographic</I> did a 360-degree
contract. They bought all the rights. It was supposed to be the
biggest thing ever to come out in 2003, and guess what happened?
<I>Pfft</I>,
nothing.
<br><br>

Well,
what we have now is evidence that somebody out there who is
responsible for building this seal into the dollar, knew that these
pyramids harnessed some sort of energy field, because what you're
seeing is clearly an energetic, non-physical structure going down on
to the top of the pyramid here.
<br><br>

[slide
reads: Do Ancient Sites Harness 'Energy'?]
<br><br>

This
grants the next question. I talked about the time field, I talked
about the Russians. Is there a technology in which you can build
something that will take this natural energy that makes physical
matter that is flowing through everything and harness that energy in
a given direction? The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.


You're
going to have some fun now. You're going to get to look at some
things that are already well known to exist and I'm going to let you
just think about them.
<br><br>

The
first is <I>menhirs</I>,
which are standing stones. I want you to bear in mind that the height
of a human being is only a little bit taller than where the top of
where the shadow is in this photograph. These are enormous, enormous
stones.
<br><br>

Do you
think that maybe these enormously tall stones were built for a
reason? Do you think that maybe these ancient peoples were putting
them there because they got something out of it? Is it merely a
religious symbol, or was it put there because it had a technological
usefulness?
<br><br>

Do they
put these headstones over your grave because it's just decorative? Or
are they hoping that the headstone is going to have some sort of
energetic effect that will keep your body preserved and usher you on
into the afterlife?
<br><br>

Can
these stones actually create ripples of energy that will raise our
frequency of consciousness, that will make us feel better, that will
make us healthier, that will make everything around us more
harmonious?
<br><br>

If you
think about the possibility that these stones could be put in the
position and change the way that your mind works, then you're
thinking in the right direction.

<br><br>

They're
enormous, and it would be a lot of work to do that just for some
religious symbolism. It would be much more <I>apropos</I>
to believe that people would go to all this trouble if they could use
it for something.
<br><br>

The
next thing we're going to look at is <I>dolmens</I>.
These are stone cellars.

<br><br>

What
if you were able to build a little stone cellar, a little stone
structure, get inside of it and have it harness energy so that while
you're sitting in there, you meditate and it raises your vibration?
<br><br>

It
raises the consciousness frequency of your mind while you're inside
and all you have to do is sit under this absolutely colossal stone
that if it fell, would crush you flat instantaneously. [laughter]
Very precariously.

<br><br>

This
is Kilclooney in Ireland. Look at that thing! Look at how that
gigantic stone that weighs more than two 18-wheelers, at least, if
not much more. If that little guy were to just fall off of the tips
of the other stones, he would crush you flat. And yet, there he is,
and with all the earthquakes and with all the Earth changes that have
gone on, it is still balanced precariously, right up there.
<br><br>

Here's
another one balanced precariously. Why would they go to so much
trouble? Do you really think a bunch of guys are just going to do
this because it's cool? Do you really think they would go to the
trouble of getting themselves crushed in trying to precariously
balance these very, very massive stones just because it's a fun thing
to do? I don't think so.
<br><br>

In this
case you see that actually part of the stone has broken off and
fallen onto the ground. But the point is the same. The point is, look
at what's going on there. You go underneath, you meditate and you get
charged up.
<br><br>

Now this
is an example of a more advanced structure where a wall is built
around you. Once you go inside that wall, you now have a much, much
higher energetic charge; and you've got a little breathing hole.
<br><br>

This is
another one from the side.
<br><br>

[someone
in the audience asks for the location of the photos]
<br><br>

Ah, you,
wouldn't you like to know? No, actually I did this in a rush and I
don't know where all these locations are, but it's easy to find
online. Just look for dolmens and you'll start to find them.
<br><br>

Go to
Google pictures, Google images. Google dolmen, the word dolmen,
D-O-L-M-E-N, you'll start finding these things.
<br><br>

<I>Barrows</I>
is the next thing. Barrows are mounds. The idea here is that you
actually drill a hole into the ground, underneath the mound. There is
a round chamber inside the mound - this is well known - you go in
there and you have a little party and you meditate. It's enough now
that you can bring in a group of people.
<br><br>

It
does the same thing as a dolmen except you're burrowing into the
Earth now. So, here's some barrows. And this one, of course, you see
how well-structured it is; Silbury Hill being the biggest one.
<br><br>

Now,
here, the entrance is... of course, the English government has been
kind enough to put iron bars in front of it so you can't go in there.
They don't want you to be able to use this technology anymore, and
they're probably worried about finding condoms and stuff inside,
frankly. [laughs] But that's not what it's built for, necessarily.
Maybe it was.
<br><br>

Some
of these barrows are longer, and you also have the Mound Builders in
the US. You have all these other things like Serpent Mound in Ohio
that you can go to and see this in the US; I'm only doing the English
ones right now.
<br><br>

<I>Henges</I>
is the one that everybody is so familiar with and everybody loves.
Because now you get standing stones like the single ones you were
seeing before except now there are certain areas where the energetics
are so high that long rows of stones are being put together because
it's going to be even more powerful.
<br><br>

The sheep
really like being near these stones. In fact, animal life really can
feel this more than we can.
<br><br>

These were
not put there by accident. And again, in this case, you have a
combination of a barrow and a henge. You have the henge at the front,
here, and if you go through that path down the middle, you go into
the barrow, and you go inside and you meditate.
<br><br>

Maybe the
henge in the front helps focus the energy that's flowing through the
center of the barrow.
<br><br>

Here's
another henge, out there just hanging out in the middle of the
English countryside. Some of them are in France; some of them are in
Germany. They're in Ireland, too. They're all over the place. Here's
another one.
<br><br>

Here's
another one, here's another example.
<br><br>

One of the
most impressive, which unfortunately has been lost to the ravages of
time to a large degree, is Avebury. Now, what you're going to see
here, if you look closely, is that all of these different stones, all
of these different little dots that you see as you go along here,
represent individual stones.
<br><br>

This
looks like a giant serpent. Here's the head, and here's what it's
eaten, in its stomach... if you look up at the top in the middle
there, there's two little rings of stones inside. That represents the
meal and then here's the tail down at the bottom.
<br><br>

Down
here is one of the barrows. This is Silbury Hill, the best barrow of
all, the most famous one and the most well-structured one.
<br><br>

Look at
the geometry. Look at how it's a perfect equilateral triangle between
the head of the snake, the tail of the snake, Silbury in the middle,
and then here's the area up here.
<br><br>

Now
what this was for, this was a gigantic technology. This is a machine.
It's a machine built, based on... As you look around it, the contours
of the mountains, the contours of the land, so that a bunch of people
get inside this area right here and they have a big party and they
all meditate and chant and run around and do fun stuff, and they're
changing consciousness for themselves and for the planet.
<br><br>

That's
what this stuff was built for. It's a consciousness technology. Of
course, Stonehenge being the greatest example of all; these Sarsen
Stones as they're called are gigantic in size and very beautiful to
look at.

<br><br>

What
you may not realize is that, at one time, there was a whole ring of
them, like this. That's what it used to look like.

<br><br>

All
the stones that have fallen have been identified in the soil, because
the more they fall down over time, the more that it rains each year,
they fall further and further into the ground. But they've all been
found. So this is known to be true, I'm not making this up.
<br><br>

What
we know is that Stonehenge was used to identify Solstices, and when
the Moon and the Sun were traveling, and what would happen, because
during certain planetary alignments, certain times of the year, these
zones on the Earth became much more energetically active.
<br><br>

Are
these ancient structures connected? The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;,
through the science of Ley Lines. This was done by Sir Alfred Watkins
and we're going to talk a little bit about him.
<br><br>

He
found in the 1920s that ancient holy sites lined up in straight
lines, which he called <I>leys</I>.
Sites from extremely different ages, millennia apart, were all
aligned with one another. This includes the Neolithic Age (which is
the Stone Age), the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and the Christian era.
<br><br>

Now, he
would use this camera to basically be able to look across long
distances and see if things were in a straight line. What you see
here is the summary of the massive amount of research that he did.
What you see here is, every single one of these words is a different
ancient sacred site.
<br><br>

Nobody
ever comes out in the open and says, <I>Oh,
by the way, all these sacred sites are built in a straight line.</I>
It took a guy like Alfred Watkins to analyze this and discover it for
himself.
<br><br>

But
guess what a lot of these things are? They're cathedrals. Do you
think that maybe the Knight Templars knew that there was something
going on? Hm. Do you think that maybe they knew to build on that line
and not to build off the line?

<br><br>

Do you
think that maybe if you build a church which acts as a funnel for
this consciousness energy, that if you build that domed roof for the
church out of stone, over that line, that it is going to harness more
of this energy field from the universe and that, in so doing, it's
going to become a resonator so that when you go to church you're
going to be experiencing a revelation, a higher consciousness?
<br><br>

Do you
think that maybe the stained glass window and the Gregorian chant
music are creating harmonics that help you harmonize with the field?
Absolutely.
<br><br>

So, here's
some people from his Stonehenge club, the Straight Track Club as it
was called, the Ley Line hunters.

<br><br>

Here is a
barrow that had trees growing around it.

<br><br>

Here
is a similar ring of trees without a barrow. This is a natural Earth
effect caused by these energy fields, because they do have circular
formations. Well, it is a hyperdimensional effect. These are
harnessing hyperdimensional energy, because the hyperdimensional
energy is what makes the matter that is building the stones.

<br><br>

Let
me say that again. The matter that makes these stones, the stone
itself, the actual hard stuff, is built from hyperdimensional energy;
energy from the time field that's flowing into our space-time.

<br><br>

That's
what, according to Dr. Dewey Larson, all matter is built from is this
hyperdimensional exchange between three-dimensional time and
three-dimensional space. That's all it is.
<br><br>

So
of course you're going to get time anomalies. But it's also the
energy that builds you. It builds your DNA. It builds your body, so
when you get more of it flowing through you, you're going to have
more health and vitality.

<br><br>

Because
it's the energy of your consciousness, because it IS consciousness,
it is also going to give you a more advanced intellect.
<br><br>

So,
the way that we can actually prove that this global grid, these
energy lines, has a hyperdimensional effect that can completely pull
you out of our three-space of length, width, and height -- the
three-dimensional world -- is with the research of Ivan Sanderson.
<br><br>

He
investigated a massive number of different disappearances of ships
and airplanes. What he did is, he took everything from the dawn of
aviation, going all the way back to the first airplanes, and even
before that for the marine records. He looked for every case of
disappearance since planes were discovered.
<br><br>

He
found that the majority of what he was finding all clustered around
twelve points on the Earth's surface. That's completely
unprecedented. That is not mainstream information. It was done in the
1960s.
<br><br>

This guy
should have been treated with as much respect as somebody like Edison
or Einstein, or Alexander Graham Bell or the Wright brothers, because
this is a huge discovery. Twelve key points around the world in which
planes and ships are spontaneously disappearing.
<br><br>

He
didn't have anything in mind when he started doing this. All he did
is he looked up each one and he gave it a push-pin, push-pin,
push-pin. And where were all the push-pins at the end? They were in
twelve places.
<br><br>

Even
stranger is that the twelve places are not just haphazardly scattered
around the Earth &ndash; they're all equally distant from each other.
They're harmonically balanced with one another. They're all the same
distance apart when you look to the ones that are adjacent to each
other.
<br><br>

If you
connect the dots, you get a sacred geometry, which happens to be the
same geometry that's in the polio virus, the same geometry that's in
many other viruses at the quantum level, including HIV.
<br><br>

But
it's not just a negative, toxic thing like viruses; it's a very
positive thing that's the fundamental building block of physical
matter, and biology, and life. It's an icosahedron.
<br><br>

Now,
here we go. This is the Bermuda Triangle. Obviously you know about
this one. Believe me when I tell you that there are many, many
airplane disappearances that cannot be explained, where they've never
found an oil slick or flotsam on the surface of the water. All they
find is missing plane.
<br><br>

It's
on the radar one minute and it's gone the next. There is no oil
slick, there's no wreckage, nothing. And they don't find anything on
the surface, on the bottom of the ocean floor, either. It's gone.
<br><br>

What
happened is, it's passing through a portal. It's passing through a
time gate &ndash; a gate into another frequency of reality; a
parallel universe in which time is three dimensional.
<br><br>

Here
are the twelve points that he discovered with his push-pins.
[referring to slide: Ivan Sanderson's<I>
Vile Vortices - </I>showing a world map
with triangles in a pattern] Take a close look.
<br><br>

You
see the Bermuda Triangle off the coast of Florida. You see another
one near Brazil in South America. You see another one here, on the
land in Africa. Another one down here by Sri Lanka. You see one
that's the Himalayan mountains... all that crazy stuff like the
Master and Teachings of the far East [<I>Life
and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East</I>],
Tibet, all that stuff up there.
<br><br>

You've
got some that are out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean here, which
is a real lonely area to get stuck in. The Easter Islands is down
here. Then you got one here which is the Devil's Triangle. That's
officially been declared a disaster area by the Japanese government.
They do not allow you to fly or sail through this area.
<br><br>

You
also have two bracketing Australia, and that's very important.
Australia, if you notice, is the only continent that is completely
pinned between -- actually, four.
<br><br>

Because
what he doesn't show you on this map is that there's one down here on
the South Pole, one up here on the North Pole. So you've got one,
two, three, four... Australia is geometrically perfectly in the
center of four of the most important nodes. So there's a lot of crazy
stuff.
<br><br>

And the
exact geometric center of the nodes happens to be right where Pine
Gap is, which is one of the biggest bases where all this stuff is
being done.
<br><br>

You
connect the dots together, you get your icosahedron, which you see
here on the left is the geometry. This is what it looks like
superimposed over the Earth's surface, on the right.
<br><br>

[next
slide]
<br><br>

Now,
this is where it gets even more interesting. These three Russian
scientists, and everybody laughs when I say their names: Goncharov,
Morozov, and Makarov [<I>Nicolai Goncharov, Vyachelslav Morozov,
Valery Makarov</I>] See you're not laughing
because I told you it's not cool to laugh, so like, now you don't
want to laugh. [laughter]
<br><br>

What
they did is they went through and they looked at every single line
that was discovered by Sir Alfred Watkins; remember the guy that did
the Ley Lines? We were just talking about that. How all these
churches and all these Neolithic sites and Iron Age sites and Bronze
Age sites... they're all in straight lines.
<br><br>

Well
these Russian dudes took every single one of those things that Alfred
Watkins discovered, and they took every single OTHER structure they
could find around the world - the Great Pyramid, Stonehenge, Easter
Island, temples and pagodas in Asia, China, Japan.

<br><br>

They
looked at every single weird, monolithic (which means big stone
structure) they could find anywhere in the world and they found that
every single one of them fit onto a single grid which was very simple
to construct.
<br><br>

All
you had to do is start with the same twelve points that Ivan
Sanderson found where these matter time-space warps would happen,
take those twelve points, connect the dots just like I did... that is
the icosahedron.
<br><br>

But then,
the icosahedron has a curious property. It is a geometry that,
because it is perfect, can be inverted. It is a mathematical thing
you can do where you flip the geometry inside-out, literally. That's
what it would be. If you add the structure, like made out of wires,
you could actually flip it inside-out and rebuild it, but build it
backwards. Build the geometric inverse of it.
<br><br>

All you've
got to do is inverse the icosahedron and make it so that it fits
together with the original icosahedron and you get this grid. Here it
is.


So,
I want to point out to you again, because this is a little bit
confusing if you don't know what you're looking at, that all of your
original points are still there. Here's the Bermuda Triangle, here's
the one on the southern tip, here's the two that I was talking about
around Australia, the one that's up there, here is the one at the
South Pole. So, they're all still there, but now you've added in the
geometric opposite.
<br><br>

If
you simply build this geometry, you now have a diagram that shows you
where every single ancient site in the entire world has been
constructed on. Over 4,000. They couldn't find a single one that was
anything impressive that wasn't built on this grid. Why do you think
that is?
<br><br>

If
you have a wire that is going to go to something that powers an
electrical appliance, are you going to put the wire under your armpit
and expect that it's going to work? No. You plug it into the wall.
<br><br>

If you
build a pyramid and you don't build it on this grid, do you think
that it's going to work? Not anywhere near as good.
<br><br>

You've
got to build it where the energy is. That's why with these cold
fusion guys, they're looking at the cold fusion reactions. They build
devices that actually work in some places, but then they bring it
somewhere else, it doesn't work anymore.
<br><br>

It's
on <I>60 Minutes</I>,
they talked about this. <I>Well, we
don't understand. Oh, it must not work.</I>
Then the scientists say, <I>Well, the
whole technology is wrong.</I>
<br><br>

No.
It's because, if you're on the grid, it's going to work.

<br><br>

It's
very simple. Let's put all of the cold fusion devices on the grid
where they work, then we'll wire them up and we're done. Just build
it where it needs to go.

<br><br>

It's very
simple. You have energy in one place, and it's not somewhere else. It
happens to be the energy of the time field.
<br><br>

Well, look
at what else you got here. You got the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This is
the volcanic ridge that defines what's pushing apart the two
continents.
<br><br>

If
you start looking at the next grid which is the Becker-Hagens grid,
they've basically taken the same thing... the black dots are Ivan
Sanderson&rsquo;s twelve vortexes, again, all the matter-time-space
warping going on there. You have all the points of the geometric
inverse of the icosahedron.

<br><br>

But
what they do is they actually take two icosahedrons and they put one
out of phase with the other. Rather than inverting it, they just take
a second icosahedron and make it a little bit out of phase.
<br><br>

We
have a phone ringing. That's a sign. Do you guys need a break?
[audience responds] No? See, we're having mutiny, Kerry. What should
we do? The troops don't know what to do.
<br><br>

[David
listens as Kerry speaks offstage]
<br><br>

Okay. All
right, we'll do a short meditation and mentally clear the room.
That's why we got the cell phone ringing and distracting me.
<br><br>

I
would ask that you just take a couple minutes, take a nice deep
breath now. If you need to use the restroom, please go because this
is going to be enough time that you can actually have a break, if you
need one. I won't be offended, I promise.
<br><br>

Some
of you are hardcore and are just going to sit through this, that's
cool. Either way is fine, I won't judge you. We'll just laugh about
you once you're out of the room. I'll make jokes about you.
[laughter]
<br><br>

Let's go
into the infinite peace of this moment. You may want to close your
eyes. You may want to spend a little time relaxing.
<br><br>

Just give
yourself over to the loving presence of the cosmos. Let yourself feel
the articulations of intelligent infinity which speak to you in the
moments between moments.
<br><br>

Give
yourself an opportunity to relax into the full awareness of who you
are. Take comfort in the beauty of you. Take pleasure in the Divine
Energy that makes you who you are.
<br><br>

As
you tune in deeper and deeper to yourself, you become a pyramid, you
become a standing stone. You become a lens of light for cosmic energy
to flow through.
<br><br>

It doesn't
require you to spend any money. It doesn't require you to have any
advanced degree, or university education. It doesn't require you to
drink anything, eat anything, take any pill, smoke anything.
<br><br>

All
it requires is peace. All it requires is tranquility. All it requires
is the knowingness that you are more than your physical body, that
you are a Divine Light, a glorious gift from the cosmos.
<br><br>

That
any and all negativity that has hung around you can be cleansed away
much like a traditional housewife would sweep out the house with a
broom. With all the doors open, the dust comes flying out. The floors
become clean.

<br><br>

It becomes
easier and easier to walk around undisturbed, to appreciate the
bounty of your own space, the bounty of your own sovereign identity.
<br><br>

For
when you learn to love yourself, you can have those boundaries, you
can sweep out the dust in your own life as we're now doing on the
planet.

<br><br>

The
very air that passes through your lungs is the living conduit of
universal light that carries you like a magic carpet to lands unseen
that float in the sky, lands that are beyond physicality. You have
every opportunity to reach out and find those lands.

<br><br>

You
have the glory of being yourself in this moment. You have an
opportunity to expand your awareness, so that that mind that thinks
through the hardware of the brain is not just the mind of your
personal ego but the Universal Mind that is much more than just your
own personal self.
<br><br>

It
is the Self with a capital S. Let's experience that Self, because as
you do, the energy flows through you and it is an energy that creates
an impenetrable shield that no negativity can penetrate.
<br><br>

It
is a living vessel of light, the chalice of the Holy Grail that
allows you to be perfectly sovereign in mind and in body and in
spirit. By living through that consciousness, you live in the
presence of your everlasting awareness, your eternal identity, which
is never going to be terminated by the loss of a body. It is much
more than that.
<br><br>

Your mind
is information and the information has identity and the identity is
the universe.
<br><br>

So, now I
will start to bring you back into the conscious mind. Most of our
friends have gone to the bathroom now, so we're all back in the room.
<br><br>

I'd
like you to see again this grid. Open your eyes and let's meditate on
that grid for a minute. You're seeing the underlying geometric
framework of the mind of the Earth. This is how it has been built and
this is what structures the continents the way they are.
<br><br>

Look at
how the coast of Rio de Janeiro is pushed in by this node. Look at
how the whole shape of South America is defined by the lines that
surround it. There's many, many examples of this.
<br><br>

This is
the stretching pattern that the Earth makes as it expands. You can
see island chains that are part of circles. Here is another island
chain that is part of a larger circle.
<br><br>

Just
connect those nodes together. Look at the two points in the middle,
it looks like cell mitosis. That's not an accident.
<br><br>

[Listening
and responding to someone talking to David] Oh, really? Well, that's
interesting. I was just informed that there was a UFO sighting right
outside the building at the time that the cell phone went off. [David
laughs, audience responds] Believe it or not. But, ah, that's pretty
cool.
<br><br>

Well,
thank you guys for showing up. Actually, there is a whole bunch of
them on the ceiling here. [laughs]
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

Cool.
All right. Hopefully you're a little bit less hypnotized now and
we'll get back into enough of a thinking mind that you can follow me.


<br><br>

We
proved the ancient sites harnessed useable energy. The Russian
pyramid research holds the key. The Russians, after the fall of the
Iron Curtain, had all of their military-industrial complex, all of
their infrastructure, and they had the laboratories available to be
able to build pyramids and study what they would do. And that's what
they did.
<br><br>

Here
are actual photographs of the Russian pyramids. Check this out. These
are enormous, these are little, bitty, those little dots down there?
Those are people, okay? So look at that, look at the size of that
thing.
<br><br>

Here is
somebody posing in front of it. Here's what it looks like on the
inside. It's made of PVC plastic pipes with a fiberglass facing.
<br><br>

Sometimes
they are built near oil fields, as you can see here. Sometimes they
were built out in the countryside. That is a smaller one; here he is
posing in front of it.
<br><br>

Now,
some very, very strange things happened when they did this. They
built one over an oil well. It would become 25% more productive and
the oil that came out was 25% purer.
<br><br>

It
would make poisonous chemicals no longer poisonous to the body. They
would become safe enough that you could dump it on your skin or drink
it and you were fine. I do not recommend that you try this, okay? But
that's what they said they found.
<br><br>

Diseases
would be cured, even cancer. It's an energetic phenomenon.

<br><br>

They
had white, under-bred mice and they injected them with a toxin that
would normally destroy them. If 60 % of the mice died from the toxin
in the laboratory, when they put those same mice under the pyramid,
guess how many of them died? Only 6%. So 94% of all the mice injected
with a lethal toxin that were put in the pyramids that they built
here, that you just saw, didn't die.


Up
to 400% increase in the productivity of agricultural seeds. You throw
these seeds into the pyramid, guess what happens? You grow the same
plants but now they're 400% larger and they've got better fruit;
everything is better about them. So you can grow super-seeds.
<br><br>

Strong
electrical activity. You can put a little voltage pile, a little
battery, on top of the pyramid and it generates current. It's
fascinating.
<br><br>

Significant
earthquake reduction. This is where you start seeing how the Earth's
energy fields are related to severe weather and severe Earth changes.
<br><br>

If you
build these pyramids, then guess what happens with earthquakes? You
don't get a big, giant quake anymore. You get a bunch of little ones
that don't cause any damage.
<br><br>

You also
see an enormous column of energy hundreds of miles wide around the
pyramid. This is not electromagnetic energy. This is the energy which
the Russians can measure which they call torsion fields, or the time
field.
<br><br>

That
energy column, that hundreds-of-miles-wide energy column from one
pyramid is enough to cause big storm fronts coming through to kind of
go around it like there is a big circle there. They just WROOP! They
go around it. It's crazy. It's been proven.
<br><br>

What
they also did is they took giant slabs of granite that they were
going to use to build these jail cells in Russia - that's a lot
better than an American jail cell, isn't it?

<br><br>

They
take these granite slabs and they built 5,000 prisoners' cells from
these granite slabs and they watched these guys. They didn't do
anything else to their environment; they didn't do anything else to
their diet or their medication.
<br><br>

Now,
one could argue, well, maybe the prisoners were really happy that
they had a nice granite cell that they could hang out in. But that's
not enough to explain what happened; because they had a profound
improvement in their attitude and behavior, including substantial
increase in addiction recovery from alcoholism and drug abuse.
<br><br>

So,
all these prisoners that are living in these jail cells that were
charged up with granite from the pyramid... and that's all that it
was... all their behavior starts improving because they're living
inside a harmonic resonating chamber. The granite crystals have
actually changed their structure.
<br><br>

If
you think about how you magnetize an iron nail: You take a piece of
iron, right, like a nail, and you start stroking it with a magnet.
The more that you do that, eventually it becomes magnetized and you
can pick things up with it.

<br><br>

Well, we
know that the reason why that works is that all the molecules in the
iron are now going north to south in their electrical charge, in the
same direction. That's what starts to cause it to happen.
<br><br>

So
we know that you can do it to metal. You don't see anything different
about the nail, but we know that it becomes magnetic because the
atoms are changing inside.
<br><br>

The
pyramid does the same thing to crystals. You put the granite crystals
inside, the crystals change.
<br><br>

I
don't have it in the slide show here, but another thing they did was
just to take a bunch of granite rocks and just throw them all over
the floor and leave them there. What they found was that, if they
came back after a few months - the granite is usually a reddish color
- they came back after a few months and there were rings in the rocks
they had just thrown on the ground and the rings were white-ish.

<br><br>

The
granite changed color. It actually changed from a reddish color to a
white-ish color in a ring. That's how much these fields change
crystals and their actual structure.
<br><br>

When
you get to the point of earthquakes and how earthquakes can be
changed and reduced by the pyramids, and how human behavior is
improved by the pyramids &ndash; you just put the prisoners in those
granite cells and they get much better &ndash; this proves that our
consciousness is tethered to the Earth's consciousness.

<br><br>

You
harness the Earth's consciousness with the pyramid that acts like a
funnel for this energy. The energy that builds each molecule of the
pyramid is an energy that is in you. So the energy that makes you who
you are can be harnessed in the pyramid just by the fact that it is
shaped that way.
<br><br>

There
is an energy that flows into every atom in that pyramid, and if the
pyramid is a perfect sphere, then it's going to all flow in the same
way; but, if it's a funnel shape, it's going to flow in with a
directional current. That's all it is &ndash; it's a funnel. It's
very, very simple.

<br><br>

This
proves the connection between our consciousness and earthquakes, a
connection between our consciousness and severe weather, a strong
likelihood that our consciousness is directly affecting the Earth.
That's a very important point.
<br><br>

Of
course, the greatest pyramid of all is, not surprisingly, called the
&quot;Great Pyramid&quot;. We know that when you go inside the Great
Pyramid, they have this sarcophagus that you lie in and the ancient
technique was that it would cause you to have this meeting with your
shadow, a projection of your shadow.
<br><br>

You
go into an out-of-body consciousness, and you go into this other
realm which is time-space as we would now call it. You encounter your
shadow projection. If you can heal yourself, which means if you
embrace your shadow...
<br><br>

You
know the best thing you can do if you're in a nightmare and something
is chasing you and you're terrified of it -- don't keep running. Stop
running, turn around and say: <I>Who are
you, and what do you want?</I> Don't be
afraid at all; get rid of the fear.
<br><br>

What
you'll find is that, if you're not afraid of it, you're going to
start seeing it change. The more that it changes, the more that
you'll see that it is yourself. When you realize that it's yourself,
you embrace it and there's this huge flash of white light &ndash; you
have this amazing experience and you wake up in tears.
<br><br>

Many
people have reported this. That is the integration process the
pyramid is talking about, except in the pyramid it's so powerful that
you literally come out with ascended abilities. You literally can do
things that we would consider miracles, such as telekinesis,
levitation, instant healing, telepathy, etcetera.
<br><br>

Well...
it's not everybody&rsquo;s experience. Napoleon went into the King's
Chamber. What do you think happens to a guy like that when he spends
a night in the sarcophagus? This is what he wrote after it happened:
<I>He was absolutely terrified. He had a
horrible night. He never wanted to go anywhere near it again.</I>
<br><br>

So
I ask you this, when the apple fell in front of Sir Isaac Newton, was
that the first time that gravity was working? [laughs] No, it was the
first time someone recognized that gravity was working.
<br><br>

Is this
presentation and the signs that we've been putting together recently
the first time that anybody has recognized that this is working on
Earth? No, right?

<br><br>

Because
what? Pyramids &ndash; global grid &ndash; everybody built it on the
grid. Why did they build it on the grid? Because they saw the apple
fall, they knew there was an energy field responsible for that.
Except in this case it is not an apple falling, it's a consciousness
rising.
<br><br>

So
have we seen the apple fall in modern times? The answer is NO. We're
trying to explain everything on electromagnetic energy and we don't
understand that there is an energy beneath electromagnetic energy
that's even more important.
<br><br>

[slide
reads: Is There Really a &quot;God&quot; That Can Be Explained
Scientifically?]
<br><br>

This
really becomes a scientific validation of the idea of a Higher Power,
that there is some Divine Intelligence that is more than you and me
in separated brain-pans, and there's nothing else that's there.
That's the old way of thinking.
<br><br>

The
new way of thinking is that consciousness is a field and that field
must exist through the whole universe, because consciousness is the
basic behavior of matter. So matter is not just in this Galaxy --
it's all over the place. It all seems to have all the same, if not
similar, rules; therefore consciousness is very likely to be
everywhere.
<br><br>

[slide
reads: Crop Circles and 2012 - Messages From &quot;God&quot;?]
<br><br>

We're
going to go back into 2012. Now, we've built a lot of background for
this, so let's go into 815 AD, which is actually the first documented
record of crop circles coming down.
<br><br>

Crop
circles are not new. They have messages in them in the form of
pictures written into crops and those pictures will show us that
there is somebody out there who wants us to figure out a puzzle, who
wants us to solve a mystery.
<br><br>

815
AD: If you look at these lavish, sunny, lovely quarters, it's
actually very Gothic and gloomy. This is the Archbishop of Lyons
issuing an edict called <I>Against the
Foolish Opinion of the Masses About Hail and Thunder</I>.
<br><br>

People
believed in &quot;cloud ships&quot; from a place they called
&quot;Magonia&quot;. What do you think a cloud ship is? Do you think
that's a cloud?
<br><br>

No.
Think about it. A cloud ship is not a cloud. A cloud ship is
something that they see flying in the air and they say: <I>Well,
clouds fly in the air. It's a cloud ship.</I>


<br><br>

They
believed that these cloud ships were flattening crops into circles
because the cloud ships says,<I> Well,
I'm going to protect you from bad weather, but here is what you need
to do for me. If I'm going to protect you, then you need to let me
flatten these circles out in your crops.</I>
<br><br>

It's kind
of a weird deal to make with cloud ships but, what the hell, that's
what they thought was going on.
<br><br>

Agobard
issued a prohibition against any locals taking seeds out of the crop
circles for pagan fertility rituals.

<br><br>

So
what that means is that people were getting a bliss hit from the
energized crops. They would build little huts out of them and stuff,
and they would want to have a pagan fertility ritual in them which,
of course, means what were they doing inside the little grass hut?
Hm, I wonder. [laughter]
<br><br>

That
was purely subconscious. I have no idea what I'm doing there [rubs
his index fingers together]. Or, I could go... [makes suggestive
gesture using microphone; audience laughs] No, there is no subtext.
I'm not giving you any subtext.&nbsp;
<br><br>

Obviously,
what's going on is the farmers are getting really angry because
they're losing their crops. So the farmers start saying: <I>Hey
you guys, stop doing this.</I>

<br><br>

And
they say: <I>No, man. Check it out! The
energy is amazing.</I>

<br><br>

The
farmers are like: <I>Oh my God.</I>
<br><br>

So
back then, the church was basically the government, so they go to
the... basically, the equivalent of the government and they say,<I>
Hey, look, okay, we've got to stop these people.</I>
So Agobard, being also the Governor, basically, has to issue this
prohibition.
<br><br>

Well,
guess what it was all built around? It was built around crop circles;
perfect circles in the crop 1200 years ago. Are crop circles new? No!
<br><br>

All right.
<br><br>

[slide:
1880 Illustration of Fairy Rings]
<br><br>

&quot;Elferingewort&quot;
is a fairy ring - a ring of daisies caused by elves dancing - a
legend that dates to the 12th century. I found this on Wikipedia, of
all places. This is the people that are partying and dancing and
making the thing fall down in the angelic realm. That is what they
believed caused these rings, from 1880.
<br><br>

This
is a strange story. Look at this. This is the equivalent of headline
news in 1678.
<br><br>

This
is what happened: Somebody comes over to chop down a farmer's crop.
He's called a mower. The mower wanted a lot of money. The farmer
wasn't willing to pay that much, so the farmer gets all pissed off
and says, <I>I'd rather have the Devil
chop down these crops than you, man.</I>
<br><br>

That
night, the farmer's in bed and the whole field lights up like it's on
fire. The perfect circle appeared in the crops the next morning, as
it says in this thing you just saw: <I>So
neatly mow'd that no mortal man could have done it.</I>
<br><br>

Well,
now we believe it was a bunch of drunk guys walking around, <I>Eh,
isn't this great? We're making a crop circle.</I>
[faking British accent] That's not the way it worked back then. They
were smart enough to know that no person could have done this.
<br><br>

So this is
the illustration. So, of course, if no person could have done it,
it's got to be the devil. It's obvious. Everybody knows that. So,
it's the devil.
<br><br>

[slide:
The &quot;Mowing Devil&quot;; 1678 picture]
<br><br>

There
he is, doing his little job: perp-perp-perp-perp-perp. He's in no
hurry; he's going around doing his thing.
<br><br>

[next
slide: Dr. Robert Plot (1640-1696)]
<br><br>

Okay,
now we have Dr. Robert Plot, who&rsquo;s at the beginning of the
Renaissance, a very educated and enlightened scientist, who was smart
enough to look at the hip bone of a Megalosaurus and see something
entirely different. It's the world's first homoerotic paleontologist
because he saw the scrotum of a giant here. What a boner that would
be. [laughter]
<br><br>

All right.
So what he did is he started to look at these crop circles forming
and he actually drew pictures of them in the 1600s. These are his
actual photographs.
<br><br>

These
are not just &quot;circles&quot;. That's a spiral. That looks like
somebody's ear with a sound wave going into it. And here is a perfect
square inside a perfect circle.
<br><br>

So
Dr. Robert Plot's educated hypothesis was: <I>Oh,
well, there is a piece of square wind, you see. The square wind is
making a square hole in the crops.</I>
[faking British accent]
<br><br>

That
is actually not much better than what modern scientists are trying to
say for crop circles now, so nothing has changed for 400 years,
unfortunately.
<br><br>

He
also found that the soil underneath the crop circles was much drier
than ordinary, which smelled like moldy bread. But then what does the
guy do? He puts it in his mouth and he tastes it &ndash; that's a
dedicated scientist! <I>Oh my God, it's
horrible. Blah!</I> [faking British
accent]

<br><br>

Except
he found that it didn't taste bad, so what do we know this is? This
is all the water being zapped out of the soil; it's totally dried
out. That's a cosmic thing that happened. That&rsquo;s
extraterrestrial technology.
<br><br>

Dr.
Gil Levengood documented the same thing in the 1990s, exactly the
same thing, so it's still working the same way.
<br><br>

[slide:
William Cyril Williams, late 1940s]
<br><br>

In
the late 1940s, somebody witnessed a whirlwind touching down and
forming a circle in the corn; he believed it was wind. In only three
or four seconds, you have this perfect sharp-edged circle that was
very large, three or four meters wide, happen. It's about 30 feet -
not quite thirty feet, but it's big, like 15, 20 feet.
<br><br>

[slide:
Bryce Bond / A Shuttlewood 1972]
<br><br>

August
1972 in Warminster, he hears a noise, something pushes down the
wheat. But check out the last line, what does it say? The air was
what? <I>Completely still.</I>
There was nothing going on, no wind that could have explained what
happened here.
<br><br>

<I>In
front of my eyes I could see a great imprint taking shape. The wheat
was forced down in a clockwise direction.</I>
He hears a high-pitched humming noise and the circle opens up like an
oriental fan unfolding.
<br><br>

Guess what
guys? That's not weather, that's not wind, that's not a bunch of
drunk guys walking around stamping down the crops. This guy witnessed
it. We can put people in prison based on eyewitness testimony. That's
what he saw.
<br><br>

[next
slide - view of crop circles]
<br><br>

Well,
let's stop talking about them and start looking at them because
that's where it gets more fun. Here you have the original type of
circles you'd see, and then you start to get these patterns of four,
and there's a little one down here &ndash; that was originally called
Grapeshot.
<br><br>

[next
slide]
<br><br>

These
kinds of patterns start showing up all the time: Two circles
connected by a line with this little arch - sometimes it was there,
sometimes it wasn't - which, in pagan symbolism, is the pregnant
goddess. This is the pregnant belly; here's the head and here's the
arms.
<br><br>

But, of
course, the circle makers couldn't be content by showing us such
primitive diagrams, so they came back a couple years ago and they did
this:
<br><br>

[next
slide: goddess crop circle photo]
<br><br>

Here we
have the goddess, of course, in a geometric form but it's very
clearly obvious that's what we're seeing again. This is the rebirth
of the Earth, coming into being.
<br><br>

[next
slide]
<br><br>

You see
three goddess formations in this, from 1990. This was Alton Barnes
1990.
<br><br>

It made it
on to the cover of the Led Zeppelin CD box set, actually. That's a
much nicer version of the photograph, too, before everybody tamped it
down like you see in this one. All these footsteps messing it up over
here. It's not there.
<br><br>

[next
slide: Barbury Castle, August 11, 1991 crop circle photo]
<br><br>

Well,
this one is one of the greatest ones in terms of the impact that it
had. Richard Hoagland is really the one who made this most popular.
It shows, basically... we think it shows... first dimension, second
dimension, third dimension and then fourth in the middle, the
geometry. These lines are perfectly equated with a tetrahedron inside
a sphere.
<br><br>

[next
slide]
<br><br>

This
is a situation where a bunch of people were sitting around studying
crop circles and they said: <I>Oh, wow,
wouldn't it be great if they did a Mandelbrot set, this fractal?</I>
The very next day it shows up in the crop, so somebody's listening!
<br><br>

[next
slide: Stonehenge, July 7, 1996 crop circle photo]
<br><br>

A truck
driver drives his truck by this part of the field, he doesn't see
anything there. Fifteen minutes later the farmer is going out there
and he sees this thing in his crops. It wasn't there 15 minutes
earlier, showed up in 15 minutes, in 1996.
<br><br>

Surveyors
were asked how long it would take to do this if you plotted it all
out on the ground. They said minimum 2-3 days, and that would be if
you really worked all day and all night. It's a beautiful formation &ndash;
15 minutes.

<br><br>

[next
slide: Windmill Hill, July 29, 1996 crop circle photo]
<br><br>

This
one is even more outrageous, in 1996, because now you get three of
them rather than just one. [next slide] And they form these
interesting Cat's Cradle of equilateral triangles when you look at it
from the top down.
<br><br>

[next
slide: crop circle photo - looks like a snowflake]
<br><br>

Now,
here's another fractal and of course the skeptics start saying: <I>Well,
this isn't really a Koch snowflake.</I>
The Koch snowflake is taking the triangle and making the inverse and
then iterating it more and more, then you get this thing that looks
like a snowflake.
<br><br>

The
circle makers say, <I>Oh you don't think
it's a Koch snowflake? Well, here, you're really stupid so we're
going to give you another one.</I>
<br><br>

[next
slide: crop circle photo - looks like a snowflake inside a snowflake]
<br><br>

<I>We'll
put a snowflake in it this time just so you can figure it out.</I>
[laughter] People still don't get it.
<br><br>

[next
slide: intricately detailed crop circle photo]
<br><br>

[fake
British accent] <I>Now that is obviously
caused by an army of hedgehogs running around and around and around.
There is a perfectly rational scientific explanation: a bunch of
drunk gentlemen coming back from the pub one night with long boards
on their feet and a funny cap with a string, and they're walking
around and around, tamping down the crop circle, having the greatest
time of their lives making absolutely geometrically precise
formations in record time over one night.</I>
<br><br>

I
don't think that's what happened. And this is the kind of stuff they
were doing 1200 years ago, causing Agobard to prohibit the pagans
from taking these things out for fertility rituals, all the crops
from these circles. This is what they're doing now &ndash; it's the
same technology.

<br><br>

[next
slide]
<br><br>

That's
my favorite one yet. Never seen one that makes me happier than that
one. Look at the precision. There isn't a single part of this that's
geometrically out of alignment. Nobody on the ground could have done
that in the one night that it showed up in; it's just too complex.
<br><br>

[next
slide reads: Suggestions of Genetic Changes / Evolution?]
<br><br>

Well,
there's a message in there. Genetic change is in evolution.
<br><br>

[next
slide: photo of Froxfield &quot;Chromosome&quot; Formation, August
18, 1991]
<br><br>

Look
at this. This is chromosomes breaking in 1991. When chromosomes
break, that means the cell is about to divide. That's what this is
showing you, so there is some sort of evolution happening.
<br><br>

[next
slide: three DNA formation photos]
<br><br>

You
look in 1996; you see a very clear illustration of DNA. Do you see
the double helix there? Can everybody see that? I also want you to
pay attention to this shape right here. I want you should look at
that shape, memorize that little part. We're going to get back to
that in a minute.
<br><br>

This is
the same kind of sine wave you see here but it is in a geometric
pattern. That's '99. Now, look what happens less than a month later.
Exactly the same formation, but now it's got even more strands.
<br><br>

So
it's saying something is going to be happening to DNA. That's the
suggestion. That's one suggestion... there are others.
<br><br>

[next
slide]
<br><br>

Here is
one again that is showing you DNA but it's in a perfect circle, a
perfect ring. You can obviously see the double helix and the little
ladders connecting the two sides together. It's beautiful.
<br><br>

[next
slide]
<br><br>

But
this is the one that really gets me off. You have the Galaxy in the
center, the Milky Way Galaxy, and then you have these waves of DNA,
and you have this pattern being flagged. Look at that. There's your
double helix. Everybody see that? This is being pumped out by the
Galaxy.

<br><br>

But
look at this. In the Hebrew mystical tradition that's a special shape
called a &quot;Yod&quot;, which refers to Divine Light coming down
into manifestation on the Earth.
<br><br>

I
don't have it in this particular slide show but if you look at the
Tower card in the Tarot, there's all these Yods around the Tower
that's being struck by lightening. That represents Divine
Manifestation.
<br><br>

So
this is actually a further message saying that this DNA energy is a
Divine Manifestation.
<br><br>

<br><br>

The
definitive 2012 formation is right here. This showed up last year and
what it does &ndash; or it might have been this year, wasn't it? Man,
it hasn't been that long. Oh no, I think it was last year, I'm sorry.
I've been using this ever since it showed up.

<br><br>

Now,
there's some interesting things going on here. We look at the Sun,
okay? Now, look at the diameter of the Sun. We know that all of these
objects here represent the planets, and it's a specific planetary
alignment.
<br><br>

[next
slide: &quot;The inner part of Avebury Manor matches our inner Solar
System for a date of December 22, 2012&quot; with diagrams]
<br><br>

Well, it's
actually December 21st. This man made a mistake, but it's close
enough, with two days off you can't really make much of a difference
in terms of any of these positions.
<br><br>

But
around December 21st, 2012 &ndash; Red
Collie is the guy that did this &ndash;
look at this. You see all the positions of the planets are the same
as what's in the crop confirmation. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, they're
all in the same positions.

<br><br>

Uranus,
Neptune, Pluto. Pluto is not in the same position. It could be that
it would have broken the geometric harmony because it would've had to
have been right about here.
<br><br>

Now,
I've had a little tip from, let's say, a source. This is a human
source. This is somebody here, not any extraterrestrial. He told me
to pay attention to this.

<br><br>

He
says that also is part of the message, even though it looks like it
is just an irregularity in the ground. Why was it built so it's right
there? Is there something that we might be encountering in the future
that is right there in the Solar System? That's what we're being
told.
<br><br>

That's all
I can say on that, but I want you to think about that.
<br><br>

[next
slide]
<br><br>

Well,
look at what happens here. The Sun, after a couple days, is now
widened to the orbit of Venus. Does this not suggest that something
is going to happen to the Solar System on guess what day? December
21, 2012.
<br><br>

They
gave you the planetary alignment and they give you what's going to
happen. They show you the Sun. They show you the Sun changing in a
very, very, very, very dramatic way. This doesn't mean it's going to
kill us.
<br><br>

The other
things show that it's an energetic change. And it would also appear
that this indicates some sort of energetic influx and that these
indicate all the ET groups that are surrounding us at this time.
These are code ciphers for different planetary civilizations that are
coming in.

this data, but this is the smoking gun. When anybody tells you: <I>Oh,

slide: &quot;Solar Activity Highest in 8,000 Years!&quot; with
graphs]
<br><br>

First
of all, let's look at the activity of the Sun. It's the highest it's
ever been in 8,000 years. This is taken from Antarctic and Arctic ice
core samples which have been correlated with tree rings and all the
other stuff they use.
<br><br>

11,000
ago &ndash; the fall of Atlantis &ndash; look at how high it is. It's
almost that high now. It's the highest it's been in 8,000 years.

<br><br>

[next
slide: Telegraph.co.uk article &quot;Scientists baffled by speed of
Sun&rsquo;s storms']
<br><br>

The
sun is now giving off storms that used to take two or more hours to
get here, showers of protons. Last year&hellip; well, that's 2005,
I'm sorry. In 2005, one of them got here in 15 minutes.
<br><br>

That
means the energy in the Solar System is conducting those particles
faster, which means it's charging up. The energy is vibrating faster,
the particles move faster. It's very simple.
<br><br>

NASA
is now warning of a space Katrina in, guess what year? 2012. They're
saying that the Sun could have a massive radiation blast, just like
it's possible that the crop circle was showing us here.
<br><br>

Even
Army studies, mainstream government studies, are saying that the Sun
could be driving all the climate change on the Earth. Obviously,
we're seeing it's at an all-time 8,000-year high.
<br><br>

The
solar wind is slowing down. That's still been happening, it's very
weak. And at the same time, the Sun's bubble -- the actual magnetic
field of the Sun -- has gotten 25% smaller. The most likely
explanation for that is that the outside is pushing in on it.
<br><br>

There's
something pushing in on it making it smaller. That's what would most
likely be causing this, which again suggests that we're moving into
an area in the Galaxy where there is a higher energetic charge.

<br><br>

We
have been in touch with insider witnesses, thanks to Project Camelot,
and one of the things that we've heard is that we do have this fleet
of ships out there, outside the Solar System, and they have looked at
this wave coming in.
<br><br>

They
know there's a wave, they know it's coming in and they're studying it
and they see that it's coming into the Solar System. So they are
paying attention, but they're not going to tell us until the last
minute, which is just enough time for everybody to panic while they
run away. [Ed note: It&rsquo;s the Galactic Superwave.]
<br><br>

But
that's not what this is about. This is about genetic change, and this
is about evolution, and it's not a doom-and-gloom thing.

<br><br>

Even
though I'm showing you stuff that you could think about in a fearful
way, all of these messages, all these crop formations that they have
built up 1,200 years of credibility to show you genetic evolution.
They're not showing you doom and gloom.
<br><br>

What
would be the point? If it's an intelligent cosmos, why would it
create life on this beautiful planet, just to belch it off in a big
solar flare? That's not what this about.
<br><br>

Galactic
dust. There is more dust that came in between 2000-2001 -- 300% more
than all the 1990s combined. That's another major study that was
found.
<br><br>

If
you look at Mercury; Mercury's magnetosphere in 2008 was much more
powerful than it was seen in The Seventies with Mariner 10. Here's
the actual mainstream publication where that came through.
<br><br>

Now,
just recently, they go back a year later and they see even more
stuff. They found magnetic tornadoes, magnetic twisters, and they
said one of the biggest surprises was how strongly the dynamics of
the planet's magnetic field / solar wind interaction had changed from
the first Mercury fly-by in January 2008.
<br><br>

So,
what this is telling you is that Mercury has changed dramatically in
its magnetic field in ONE YEAR. That's it, Mercury is going nuts.
That's the first planet in the Solar System.
<br><br>

That's
not the only planet that's doing this. Look at Venus: 2,500% increase
in the green glow in less than 20 years, looking like this right
here. That's totally amazing.
<br><br>

On Mars
you have the appearance of clouds. You see the clouds here that
weren't there? Mars didn't use to have clouds or ozone. They've only
appeared in the last 30 years or so. It's another major change.
<br><br>

Mainstream
media has reported on global warming on Mars. Guess what?&nbsp;
Nobody's driving SUVs on Mars. At least, if they are, there's
probably a lot less of them than there are on Earth and they probably
run on free energy, based on what our whistleblowers are telling us.
<br><br>

But
something is melting the ice caps on Mars.
<br><br>

Jupiter
has this plasma torus that you couldn't see before 1974 and yet now
it looks like this? As time goes on, the density of this torus as you
see here is getting 200% thicker - this is the natural saucering
movement that it makes as the moon Io is going around its orbit.
<br><br>

Well,
they get so bored, they're: <I>Ah, uh,
stronger than expected.</I>
<br><br>

200%
increase in the whole density of this thing in, basically, 25 years,
15 years -- very, very short time. Fifteen years, every single
particle inside this thing gets 50 percent denser. They say: <I>Well,
it exceeded expectations. </I>Okay, no
biggie.
<br><br>

Jupiter's
white ovals disappeared in three years. There's three of them up
here, then you see there's two and now there's one. Dr. Phillip
Marcus believed this would cause an 18-degree global warming on
Jupiter in only a decade.
<br><br>

Well,
guess what? It's a decade later and now Jupiter is having raging heat
thunderstorms that they're calling global upheaval &ndash; just what
he predicted would happen.
<br><br>

These are
infrared heat signatures that were not there before; much higher
intensity.
<br><br>

Now, you
camera guys, can you shoot either one of these, because I'm just
realizing that over here we have light on that slide and over here we
don't have any light, so that's a better one for me to be using my
pointer on. I think I'm going to switch over to this one now.
<br><br>

[applause]
<br><br>

Oh!
Somebody throw stones at the idiot here. [laughter] All right, never
mind. Let's keep going.
<br><br>

The
storms appeared during a dramatic planet-wide disturbance that's
ongoing on Jupiter. It's yet to be explained, but it's changed the
color of the stripes. Its storms are probably tied in with a global
upheaval.
<br><br>

Io's
ionosphere, the moon that we were showing you before: <I>1,000%
higher</I>. That's all the charged
particles which are coming from the Sun. [makes snoring sound] <I>Ah,
it's unexpected.</I>
<br><br>

This is
ridiculous. This is our entire backyard. I've showed you every
planet.
<br><br>

Mercury's
having magnetic tornadoes. Mercury is having so much change that in
one year, it's gone nuts.
<br><br>

Venus
is having a 2,500% increase in its green glow.
<br><br>

Mars is
having global warming and ozone in the atmosphere and clouds that
weren't there before.
<br><br>

Now you're
going out to Jupiter, you're seeing this plasma torus show up, all
the particles are getting bigger, there's more and more of them.
<br><br>

You
look at the moon Io, it's the same thing. The ionosphere is 1,000%
higher. The surface has gotten 200% hotter, three times hotter than
Mercury? How did that happen? Surprised? <I>Oh
yeah, we can't explain it.</I> [makes
snoring sound] Okay.
<br><br>

Europa is
much brighter than expected. This is what they thought it would look
like based on what it used to look like, and this is what they
actually got. Look at all that light.
<br><br>

Ganymede,
same thing, 200% brighter. A 1,000% increase in its density of its
atmosphere.
<br><br>

Saturn's
plasma torus, 1,000% denser; same thing, short period of time,
basically twelve years.
<br><br>

Aurorae
are being seen in the polar regions of Saturn. Here's another new
thing: that's heat that wasn't there before. Massive X-rays were seen
for the first time near the equator of Saturn in 2004.
<br><br>

Uranus was
as featureless as a cue ball in 1986, but look at what happens to it
by '99.
<br><br>

Dr.
Erich Karkoschka finally has some of the childlike enthusiasm we
really should see. <I>These are really
big, big changes, man! Check it out! It's incredible. It's been hit
by huge storms, dude.</I> So he's
finally got it right.

<br><br>

[makes
snoring sound] <I>Seasonal brightness
changes, not well understood. </I>Moving
on<I> --</I>
that's the official NASA report.
<br><br>

Uranus
in 2004 is even brighter. Now, I'm going to superimpose the original
over what you've got here. Look at how much this is changing. All
that stuff is new. All this bright stuff wasn't there before.
<br><br>

Well,
guess what happens when you go out to Neptune? Exactly the same
thing. This is what it looked like in 1999.
<br><br>

This is
what it looked like in 1996: zero degrees, quarter rotation, half
rotation, three quarter rotation; doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.
<br><br>

Then
we go up to 1998, you see that there's more brightness coming in. But
look what happens in 2002. It's gone 40% brighter in near infrared,
which is just above visible light. If you could see this spectrum,
this is what it would look like. To the naked eye it's not changing
that much, but this has only barely above what our eyes can see as
visible light.
<br><br>

[slide
reads: 1989-2002: Massive Changes]
<br><br>

So,
now I'm going to show you what it looks like as it goes from '89 to
2002. Watch. Watch the bottom. Look at how much it's changing. Do you
think this is just a random thing that's being caused by the tilt of
the equator of the planet relative to the Sun? No. This is a
planet-wide, Solar-System-wide effect.
<br><br>

Global
warming on Pluto: 300% increase in its atmospheric pressure from '89
to 2002. It's moving <I>away</I>
from the Sun, but the surface of the planet is getting hotter as it
moves away from the Sun, which is causing the atmosphere to charge
up.
<br><br>

So,
this shows us that Earth changes are not unique to the Earth &ndash;
they're happening all over the place.

<br><br>

Now, Bill
and Kerry, I see you guys over there. How much time do we have, what
are we on here? Okay.
<br><br>

Well,
there's all sorts of different places we can stop and start in this
presentation, and I wanted to get you guys, sort of like when I do
these longer weekends at my conferences - like I'm having one in
London next month - we can actually drill into this data a lot more,
and there is a lot more data than I actually have had time to go into
here, but that's why I make these presentations modular.
<br><br>

But
what you're seeing here is, if you look through, I'm going to
summarize some of this stuff and zip a little faster, so we can get
to the punch line.
<br><br>

[slide
shows graph, reads: Continuous Rise in Earthquakes]
<br><br>

We're
seeing continuous rises in Earth change activity - let me do it from
this side - earthquakes, volcanic activity going up; sea levels going
up, temperatures going up; tornadoes are going up; disasters, natural
disasters; economic losses on Earth -- all this stuff.

<br><br>

The
entire Pacific Ocean sea floor is heating up, which is obviously what
happens when the Sun warms up water on the surface of the ocean. Then
those warm water particles are sinking down to the bottom where they
warm up the bottom of the ocean.
<br><br>

That's
what the scientists are actually saying is going on. So of course,
the next time you want to boil water and boil some eggs, just get a
hair dryer and brrrrrrr -- it'll work just fine, I promise. Hm, hm!
<br><br>

That's
how they've explained this, because they can't tell you that the
Earth is heating up from the inside. That's all it is. The planets
are heating up from the inside.
<br><br>

Why
are they heating up from the inside? Galactic energy fields. What are
the Galactic energy fields going to do? Change your DNA. So, let's
get to that.
<br><br>

We have to
go through some stuff here. [flipping through slides] All right.
We'll get to this because this is good.
<br><br>

Bacteria.
If you look in the Antarctic ice, in the interior of a volcano, even
inside a nuclear reactor, you'll find little critters. They're
everywhere. They even survive in space; they've been recovered after
being frozen for ten million years.

<br><br>

It's
as if some life force takes that existing body that was there and you
thaw it out and it says: <I>Oh, okay,
that's a body. I'm going to make it alive.</I>
So, there's something going on here, something more than we usually
think of life as being.

<br><br>

Some
bacteria thrive on infrared light, they photosynthesize in near
darkness; and they have been found miles below the surface of the
ocean floor.

<br><br>

It
is ridiculous to think that all these critters grew from living
bacteria, from other living bacteria. It becomes much more plausible
that those little bacteria that grew inside the nuclear reactor
didn't come from other bacteria that grow inside nuclear reactors,
that are sort of floating around saying, <I>Hm,
let me find a nuclear reactor; oh look, there's one.</I>
<br><br>

No,
those nuclear reactors are hermetically sealed for a reason, but
they're not sealed from the Source Field. They're not sealed from
this energy that goes in there and says, <I>Oh,
here's a place where I can make life.</I>
- This is like what happens in a star. - <I>Let
me go ahead and jump in there and they start creating life.</I>
<br><br>

So,
they call this a &ldquo;problem&rdquo;, but it's actually a proof.
It's a proof that life is everywhere in the universe.

<br><br>

Dr.
Chandra Wickramasinghe &ndash; say that three times fast; and try to
spell it while you're pronouncing it (I've had to practice that, I
might add) &ndash; has proven that the organic material in comets is
biological; it has critters in it. There're billions of comets in the
Solar System alone and he believes that all life on Earth may have
come here from a comet.
<br><br>

This
is Dr. Francis Crick, the co-founder of DNA. What he shows us is that
it is way too complex to have evolved by random chance. It's as if
the entire Encyclopedia Britannica fell out of the sky, one word at a
time, and it all happened to arrange like those monkeys on
typewriters. That's the kind of logical idiocy that is involved to
try to say that DNA is a Darwinian mutation from random accidents.
<br><br>

[bottom
of slide reads: &quot;99.9% of all dust in the Galaxy has the
spectrographic signature of bacteria!&quot;]
<br><br>

Here's
his biggest discovery! Now, this is the same guy who discovered DNA.
Why isn't this as popular as his other discovery? He looks at all the
dust in the line of sight between where we are on Earth and the
center of the Galaxy and all of it looks just like bacteria in its
heat signature and its light signature. Exactly the same. It IS
bacteria.
<br><br>

So
this is Howard Hughes&rsquo; worst nightmare: <I>space
is filled with germs</I>. [laughter]
Don't go to space if you're a germophobe.
<br><br>

Even
the mainstream media is saying space [dust] that creates human life
is found in other solar systems.
<br><br>

Well,
we know that space has these Source Field differences. There is a
Source Field energy in space that you don't see here on Earth. It's
called the Overview Effect, or Space Euphoria. Astronauts go out
there and they get this massive energetic high from being in space.
It's been reported by many of them.
<br><br>

The
Chinese have taken seeds and flown them into space - and it's
important that you do this in a space capsule that doesn't have PVC
plastic windows and doesn't have aluminum in the chassis. If you do
that, which is what the NASA probes are like, it doesn't work. It
won't work. If you have any PVC plastic at any point over the
windows, they're not going to do this. And if you have aluminum in
the body of the thing, it's not going to work.
<br><br>

The
Chinese built one that didn't do it that way and what happens is,
they send these seeds out into space, and remember what I said about
the pyramids built by the Russians? They tossed the seeds in and what
happened to the seeds? 400% more productive seeds; 400% bigger
plants.
<br><br>

Would
you like to see the kind of crops that the Chinese were growing when
they just flew the seeds into space? Let's go for it. Bang! There's
your pumpkin. That's the only thing they've done is grow it
hydroponically and regular hydroponic pumpkins don't do this. This is
a space pumpkin. That's the only thing they did is fly it into space.
<br><br>

[in a low
voice] It's the mystery of the Great Pumpkin from space. Every
Halloween he comes in a UFO. [laughter]
<br><br>

Now
this, isn't that amazing? That is actually called a <I>bitter
grow</I>. It is not a whale penis.
[laughter] Contrary to your belief, it is actually a melon.
<br><br>

Now, you
know those little hot peppers, right? Those little hot &quot;<I>Oh,
Jesus</I>!&quot;, or maybe you really like it, maybe you're a sadist
and, &quot;<I>Oh, this is wonderful</I>.&quot; Okay.
<br><br>

Let's look
at some hot peppers. That's a lot bigger than they're supposed to be.
That's amazing stuff.
<br><br>

So,
is this the source of all life? Is all life found in an energy wave?

<br><br>

Well,
check this out. This is Dr. James Strick, <I>Sparks
of Life</I>, major scientific
conspiracy, 19th century. Many of these guys were arguing in favor of
Darwin random mutation and others argued for spontaneous generation,
life from non-living things. They didn't know whether it was one or
the another.
<br><br>

They
found numerous experimental examples of &quot;spontaneous
generation&quot;. Pasteur had cases where life originated from
non-living things, so it's not as easily dismissed as we would like
to believe. Louis Pasteur is why you have &quot;pasteurized&quot;
milk.

<br><br>

All
of these guys created a conspiracy where they buried data, where you
have sterilized test tubes where nothing could grow in there and
critters grew in there anyway. They threw it all away, because they
wanted to believe Darwin was right, because survival of the fittest
is an Illuminati philosophy that says: <I>If
I'm the best killer, then I'm the most evolved on the planet.</I>


<br><br>

That's
how they felt about themselves, so they enforced it into the
scientific structure of the world. History has been completely
rewritten in favor of that model.
<br><br>

So
now this is a big mouthful, and here's the guy's name, which is also
a big mouthful. Professor Pacheco, you can find this on
<U><A HREF="https://www.orgone.org/articles/ax2001igna01a.htm" target="_blank">https://www.orgone.org/articles/ax2001igna01a.htm</A></U>
. [Prof. Ignacio Ochoa Pacheco]
<br><br>

It's
very simple. What he did is he takes beach sand and he heats it up to
white hot luminescence; it's literally white hot, and then he takes
that sterilized beach sand and he throws it into a sterilized test
tube with sterilized distilled water in a vacuum, so there's no way
anything could have gotten in there.
<br><br>

Five
days later, this scum has grown on top of the test tube. He scrapes
it off and looks at it under a microscope. Would you like to see some
of the little things that he saw in there? Let's go for it.
<br><br>

This is
the first one. It looks like a little brain.
<br><br>

Here's
something that looks like it might be part of perhaps a sea
vegetable, like one of the leaves broke off when he put it under the
microscope. Let's look up close on that little guy and tell me if you
think this is biological.
<br><br>

Where
did his DNA come from? All that was, was sand; there was nothing else
in there. He sterilized the sand, he sterilized the water, sterilized
the air, and yet, this little critter grew in there. And that's just
one part of a bigger plant. There're pictures of where you see the
plant.
<br><br>

Here's
another one that looks like a red blood cell. Here's one that looks
like a white blood cell or a leukocyte. But here comes -- drum roll
please -- the <I>bomdiggity</I>.
This little guy probably has 20,000 to 30,000 genes, which is about
the same as you. It's similar to little round worms and stuff.
<br><br>

This
guy has a very complex DNA structure, because he has a defense
system; he has a head, he has a mouth, he probably excretes out here
somewhere, which is too much information -- but there he is.
<br><br>

Where
does DNA come from? DNA is in space, it's everywhere. The DNA wave
says: <I>Oh, this is the silica, the
basis of sand, I need to build little sea creatures in this stuff.</I>
<br><br>

Just
like when it's inside the nuclear reactor it says:<I>
Oh, this is radioactive, I need to build radioactive bacteria in
here.</I> Life is being created
everywhere it goes.
<br><br>

But
it even goes beyond that. Now, this really blew me away. Check this
out: National Geographic, February 15, 2009, found identical species
at the North and South Poles, but ONLY at the Poles. That's the only
place you find them.
<br><br>

They
tried to explain it as maybe there are ships that go from the South
Pole to the North Pole. They analyzed every single ship in the world;
none of them do this at all.
<br><br>

So,
they found 235 different species that are identical at both Poles.
They were startled; they didn't know what the heck was going on. This
includes whales, worms and crustaceans, very weird crustaceans, as
you're about to see.
<br><br>

Exactly
where these species came from and how they ended up a world apart
with comparatively warm oceans in between remains a mystery. So they
don't know what the heck these guys are, how they got there. They
don't have any idea.


Would
you like to see some of these creatures that emerged directly from
the consciousness field? Let's go for it. They're very
strange-looking things.
<br><br>

This
is called<I> Limacina helicina.</I>
This is very strange. It looks kind of like a snail but it's got
these fans on it like a squid. It's a very weird-looking thing.
<br><br>

This
is called<I> Clione limacina limacina,</I>
another very strange-looking little creature.
<br><br>

This
one is<I> Gaetanus brevispinus.</I>
This is a crustacean of some kind.
<br><br>

And
lastly you have<I> Mimonectes
sphaericus</I>. He's got a really
nasty-looking defense system up front, doesn't he? He is a little
badass, but he's out there doing his thing and guess what created
him?
<br><br>

The
consciousness of the Earth spontaneously generates these little guys
at both Poles. There is no conduit of sea water going from North to
South Pole. He would have burned up on the way through the core.
<br><br>

Think
about it. The reason why he's there is because the field generates
him, because he is supposed to be there, because the Earth makes him.
The Earth has made us.
<br><br>

So
the Solar System is creating evolution &ndash; DNA evolves by outside
energy.

<br><br>

I'm
going to have to skip ahead through all this stuff, so just give me a
second here. Ah, that's a good place to go because we're running out
of time.

<br><br>

[skips
forward to slide that reads: Dr. Tszyan Kanchzhen: DNA Transformation
by Wave.]
<br><br>

So
we've already seen now that you have DNA that has been created out of
the ether, same species at both Poles. You've seen the little guys
that grow in the test tube from nothing more than distilled water and
sterilized sand. There's this little scum that grows on top and you
look at it under a microscope and &ndash; BOOM! &ndash; Here're these
little critters.
<br><br>

What
about DNA changing from one form to another? What about transforming
DNA from one form to another, so that you have the given genetic
material of one species and it transforms into something else?
<br><br>

Well,
Kanchzhen is the guy here, and there's a lot of different ways to
pronounce his name. Most recently I've seen it spelled Chiang.
C-H-I-A-N-G is his first name. So, there's many different spellings
of this guy's name, which makes it extremely difficult to find his
work online, unfortunately.
<br><br>

So
what he does in this anatomically-correct diagram is he's got your
duck over here, you can see the feathers, the head, quack, quack,
quack, there he is. And over here you have a perfectly-described
chicken -- obviously, I'm being facetious.
<br><br>

What
you have here is these little funnels that have been built into the
sides of a little pentagonal box. He zaps this little duck with
microwaves and all the microwaves go through these copper pipes from
one room to another. If you talk in here, you'll hear it in here;
it's air that can pass through.

<br><br>

He's
zapping it with microwaves, which are not going to kill the duck, it
just kind of zaps his energy field enough to make it resonate, make
the DNA resonate. And over here, you have a chicken that has eggs in
its womb.
<br><br>

[slide:
picture of white duck]
<br><br>

Now,
I want you to look at the physiology of a duck. Notice the long beak,
the webbed feet, the longer neck, the larger internal cavity of
organs. Whereas a chicken, by comparison, - this is not what they
looked like when they came out by the way, that's just to fool you. I
actually found this when I was looking for the picture of the chicken
with the webbed feet and then I found her with ducks and I'm like,
<I>Wow, isn't that a synchronicity.</I>
<br><br>

So anyway,
look: shorter beak, no webbing between the toes.
<br><br>

This
is what actually hatched. These are called duck-hens. You see webbing
between the toes, you see this strange-looking head. We can get a
better look at it here. The eyes position is different. You get the
duck-shaped head, the longer beak, the webbing between the toes.
<br><br>

Now,
here's the stats. These add up to a total of 500 eggs; 480 of them
hatched; 80% had a flat, duck-shaped head like you just saw; 90% had
the shift in the position of the eyes &ndash; 90%! And 25% had
webbing appear between the toes.

<br><br>

This
is a Chinese scientist who did this. It's an amazing piece of
research. You go from this, and you blend it with this, and you get
duck-hens that are half-and-half. It's an amazing phenomena.
<br><br>

So,
if you've ever wondered what the heck is the duck-billed platypus?
Maybe it just so happens that a bunch of ducks and a bunch of bulls
got together and did &quot;that which we cannot speak of in polite
company&quot;, and God got so angry he smote them with a lightning
bolt. Then they had lots of little babies, and the babies are like,
<I>Daddy, Mommy. Oh, wow! What the hell
am I?</I> [laughs]
<br><br>

That could
have been what happened, or maybe God just has a weird sense of
humor.
<br><br>

[slide
reads: Dr. Peter Gariaev - Astonishing DNA Wave Transformation]
<br><br>

Gariaev
is where we get to the final point that's going to help round out the
whole talk: DNA transformation.
<br><br>

You
have frog eggs, okay? The frog eggs are laid and they're all sitting
there. Then you have a salamander's eggs, and you take a laser beam
that's not going to burn them, it's not going to kill them, it just
picks up the wave information from the salamander. You take those
salamander eggs, you shine the wave through it, you redirect the wave
into the frog eggs. Guess what happens to the frog's eggs?
<br><br>

You get a
complete metamorphosis. The genetic material of the frog's eggs
becomes cannibalized by the wave of the salamander. &quot;Cannibalized&quot;
is maybe a strong word to use, but it gobbles up all the genetic
material that was going to make a frog and totally rewrites the code
and transforms it into a salamander's body.
<br><br>

It happens
in ONE generation. You have eggs that come out of a frog's body, and
they turn into a completely different species. That doesn't take very
long. It's instantaneous energetic change.
<br><br>

So
what we're seeing is, this is the engine of evolution. This is what
the Solar System is doing to us. The Solar System's energy that's
causing all of the planets to charge up is the same as the energy of
the laser that goes through the salamander and shines into the frog,
transforms the frog eggs into salamander eggs, and they become
healthy adult salamanders.
<br><br>

They can
breed with each other. They don't get all these genetic problems when
they get older. They don't have the complications associated with
genetic cloning, of the genetic conundrum that you have with Dolly
the sheep, where like, the feet go bad as she gets older.
<br><br>

So,
again, I want to have you look once more at the fossil record, this
26-million-year cycle. Why do you think it's happening in such
regular intervals of 26 million years?
<br><br>

This
is Raup and Sepkoski. Why do you think they found another cycle
that's 62 million years long? What do these zones actually represent?
<br><br>

Well,
here's what we're going to talk about to cap off the whole talk for
you: Galactic bioenergy fields may be responsible.
<br><br>

We
now know, thanks to Dr. William Tifft, that even though most
scientists associate red shift, which is just a microwave frequency &ndash;
that's all it is, is microwave light &ndash; they associate red shift
with distance. Tifft has looked -- and his colleagues and people,
who've followed after him -- have looked at hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of galaxies and every single galaxy that they look at has a
structure like this, okay?

<br><br>

What
you're seeing here is, this is high intensity red shift, or high
intensity microwaves, and then it goes lower and lower as you go out.
So these frequency changes are very regular; this is within a regular
galaxy now. What's happening is - you can see another example of it
here. These are red shift structures. You see the layers.
<br><br>

What's
happening, we know from Dr. Rosine Lallement - and here's the link
down at the bottom, you can verify this:
[<U><A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20021231023909/https://www.wkap.nl/prod/a/ISBN_0-7923-7196-8_50_WEB.PDF" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20021231023909/https://www.wkap.nl/prod/a/ISBN_0-7923-7196-8_50_WEB.PDF</A></U>]
<br><br>

She
thinks this is only a coincidence, but what she sees is that the
local interstellar medium, the clouds that are around our Solar
System, are moving directly away from the center of the Galaxy. They
are expanding away from the center of the Galaxy.
<br><br>

So,
what we're seeing now is that these guys, these clouds in the Galaxy
are going to be expanding away from the center in regular intervals,
just like Lallement discovered. This appears to have the energy from
the Galaxy that reprograms all DNA and all life on Earth.
<br><br>

Now
I ask you this: If you have these 62-million-year cycles in the
fossil record, if you have 26-million-year cycles in the fossil
record, if you have these striated, evenly-different frequencies of
microwave energy in the Galaxy, if Dr. Rosine Lallement has proven
that the clouds are flowing at us directly from the center of the
Galaxy -- then don't you think, maybe, just maybe, interplanetary
climate change is being caused by Galactic energy fields, which are
squeezing in the heliosphere, making it 25% smaller, shooting in
particles to the Solar System, causing all of the planets to get
charged up, hotter, brighter, more magnetic, and that that energy
actually has the DNA wave information to transform every living
species on this planet into the next level?
<br><br>

Because,
guess what? This is a 62-million-year cycle and the last time it
fired up was 65 million years ago. This is probably off because of
the variations in the influx of solar radiation. We're at the end of
the cycle right now.
<br><br>

Now
there's one thing that we're going to end with and that is the final
proof that is going to make this all come together for you.
<br><br>

[slide
reads: Human Evolution is Dramatically Speeding Up]
<br><br>

I
can prove to you that human evolution is already doing what we expect
it would do, based on interplanetary climate change, based on the
science I've showed you. I have the scientific proof that you are
actually evolving, genetically, based on this science. Check this
out.
<br><br>

John
Hawks, University of Wisconsin anthropologist, studied evolution in
human beings &ndash; it&rsquo;s called positive selection. He found
that in the last 5,000 years, your DNA is upgrading a hundred times
faster than ever in human history. In fact, the last 40,000 years
have been a time of supercharged evolutionary change.

<br><br>

We
are more genetically different from people 5,000 years ago... that's
3,000 BC. That's the time of things like the time of Sumerians, and
that's the time of the Indian Hindu scriptures.
<br><br>

We
normally think of these people, the Old Testament and just a little
bit after that, ancient Egypt, people building pyramids... we don't
think of them as much different than we are.
<br><br>

But
if you compare those people that are building pyramids in Egypt to
the Neanderthals &ndash; Neanderthals, right? With the big clunky
brow? Nothing like mine; my brow has nothing like that. I'm not a
Neanderthal.

<br><br>

He
compared those people in Egypt with Neanderthals, and they are more
similar to Neanderthals than they are to us. You don't think about it
because we look around, we say: <I>Yeah,
these are people. Everybody is the same, you know.</I>
<br><br>

But
look, the genetic proof is already here. We've changed more in 5,000
years than ever in human history, and he's calling it supercharged.
This is an actual mainstream media proof of that.

<br><br>

And
here's another one showing that our evolutionary fast lane is
becoming increasingly different at a hundred times faster in the last
5,000 years.
<br><br>

Now,
here's the last thing. Our average IQ has had to be increased by
three points a decade. It's been studied in over 20 different
countries, by Flynn, and it's continued for over a century. And our
IQ is rising the most in abstract, nonverbal patterns, which means it
doesn't have to do with us reading more magazines, newspapers and
surfing the Internet. It's a symbolic intelligence.
<br><br>

So
this is the hard-core proof, scientifically measurable, the reason
why the IQ is going up like that, because a score of 100 is supposed
to be average... that's how it's weighed. So in order to keep 100
average, you have to bump it up by three points every 100 years --
because everybody's getting so much smarter, you got to keep knocking
down their IQ score.
<br><br>

Because
everybody's average is now 100, that means everybody is so much
smarter, now your IQ is going to go down and down and down, which if
you have low self esteem, could really hurt you. So, don't hang out
much longer, just, you know, psfaw. No, I'm not saying you should
kill yourself, of course, unless you're really, really arrogant about
your IQ.
<br><br>

Anyway,
this is where we're going. It amounts to a cultural renaissance.

<br><br>

So,
the Galaxy &ndash; and this is the final point &ndash; 20 years of
study of ESP has proven, scientifically sound studies... He looked at
all of these studies -- Spottiswoode his name is -- to see if people
were psychic when it's high noon or a certain time of the day. He
didn't find anything in the normal day, which is where the Sun is
relative to the center of the Earth, but when the Earth's position
relative to the center of the Galaxy was studied, he found that when
you are aligned with the center of the Galaxy, your ESP ability goes
up by 400%. This is a mainstream scientific study.

<br><br>

So
think about this. We now have the proof, and this is what I'm going
to end on, we now have the proof that galactic energy, as you see
right here, he took 20 years&rsquo; worth of studies into ESP, 20
years, and he found that people got more psychic when the galactic
energy field is hitting them.
<br><br>

I've
showed you layers of fields in the Galaxy that are measurable on a
superficial level by microwaves, just like near-infrared is showing
up on the planet, same thing.
<br><br>

I've
shown you proof from Rosine Lallement that these galactic energy
waves are in fact expanding away from the center of the Galaxy as
they go out. It's not proof, but it's certainly circumstantial
evidence that strongly leads in that direction.
<br><br>

I'm
showing you proof that the Solar System is changing, proof that the
Sun's heliosphere is shrinking, which suggests very strongly a
galactic causation.
<br><br>

If
the galactic energy can make you more intelligent, and if all the
species on the Earth are being reprogrammed in their DNA in 62- and
26-million-year cycles, and if we're at the end of another
62-million-year cycle right now, then let's put our hands together,
because we are awake and aware and we're walking into the New Age,
maybe in 2012.
<br><br>

Thank you
so much.
<br><br>

<br><br>

All right,
I got a standing O, baby, a standing O.

I'm glad
you liked it.
<br><br>

KC:
 David, thank you. That was absolutely superb, as usual. I wish we
had more time for you actually.
<br><br>

David
Wilcock, Ladies and Gentlemen, and thank you very much for staying
with us all this time, being so patient.
