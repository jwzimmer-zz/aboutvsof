Dr. PETE PETERSON (PP):

<br><br>

...It&rsquo;s
an area that&rsquo;s very highly defendable. That was very important
because of my belief, and the belief of many other people that I have
great respect for, that the world is going through a... I&rsquo;ll
call it a meltdown.
<br><br>

...Once
the people found out what had done to them by their representatives,
they felt that it would be much better for their health and safety to
be somewhere else.
<br><br>

...My
understanding, it was the third-ever closed session of Congress.
<br><br>

...We
found that no matter where the politician was and what committee he
was on, when top secret things were talked about, they wanted to
close the session early so they could get out and put their tips out
to the news. We don&rsquo;t have any confidentiality in that. It
leaked out, I&rsquo;m sure.
<br><br>

BR:
 Am I right in assuming that you wouldn&rsquo;t contradict those
leaks?
<br><br>

PP:
 I wouldn&rsquo;t contradict them at all.
<br><br>

BR:
 Thank you.

BILL
RYAN (BR):  This is Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot
and this is Monday, June the 29th, 2009. And this is a Project
Camelot interview with a difference because not only have I flown the
best part of 8,000 miles &ndash; at least it feels like, if it's not
quite that many &ndash; from Europe to be here for the weekend, but
we are also here with David Wilcock, who has also flown from Los
Angeles here for the weekend, to join us in a meeting that we had
with Dr. Pete Peterson, who&rsquo;s a name that not many people will
know, but may be &ndash; among the many extraordinary whistleblowers
and contacts and researchers and scientists who we have had the great
pleasure of talking to &ndash; may be one of the most important.
<br><br>

Yesterday
we were talking off-record for the best part of twelve hours and our
minds are still digesting an enormous amount of extraordinary
information that he shared with us, some of which is off-record. As
much as possible, Pete is willing to put on record here, on camera,
because you feel, don't you, Pete, that there is a profound and
important reason why the sort of people who will be watching this
video need to hear what it is that you have to say.
<br><br>

We
want to salute you because you're a very brave man. One of the things
we want to ask you straight off the cuff is why is it that you feel
that you wanted to put some of your almost unbelievable and very
important testimonies on camera for a lot of people to listen to and
watch and understand at this time? Why is it that you've come forward
and you're talking to us now?
<br><br>

Dr.
PETE PETERSON (PP):  Well, I think the main reason for that is I've
had an inside insight for many, many years, having been picked up in
various programs to do things for the government since I was 13 years
old. Being a problem-solver, I wish I could say that it was hard work
and so forth, but I come from a long line of inventors on both sides
of my family tree, and people who graduated from school very early
and were significant in affecting things that affected humanity, a
number of them, in virtually every kind of field and climate.

<br><br>

I
see that the world seems to have gone downhill. I'm aware of many
programs to remove intelligence from people and return the people, at
least of this nation [America], to a mediocre status. We've watched
the school systems deteriorate. We've watched the, as my wife likes
to say, the program in the school systems <I>No
child left with a mind. </I>(That's
her paraphrase for it.)

<br><br>

And
I've seen that the type of government we have... though I'm a patriot
and very crudely use the phrase that <I>I
got the flag tattooed on both cheeks of my fanny the hard way. </I>I
spent ten years in the Marine Corps and a great part of that was in
combat and combat zones and other things I did for the government. I
like to think I'm unique in that I was probably shot at on most
continents.
<br><br>

Anyway,
what I see happening is a complete turn away from the way this
country started out and in its Constitution to what appears to be
headed toward a socialistic system where reason and logic has no
bearing.

<br><br>

It
concerns me. I have no idea if my voice can help. I have no idea if
that can, but I know that my ideas, I have ideas, I have inventions
that have proven to be very helpful to society. Many of them have
been suppressed by the fact that we had a government that was run by
industry rather than by the people. It's turned away from that, and
many industries are actually governed by rules and regulations that
make it virtually impossible for them to exist if they do things that
are good for humanity.

<br><br>

For
example, we've had numerous things that have happened in the industry
of alternative power that were very inexpensive, very capable. But
what we do is we've, through their own legislation, limited the power
companies to being able to charge a certain amount over and above
their costs, so when their costs went down, their profit went down
and they couldn't economically operate.
<br><br>

BR:
 What I would love to ask you about, Pete, before we go into some of
the stories that you have to tell &ndash; and we have good reason to
believe that, having spent the best part of twelve hours yesterday
talking about a tiny fraction of your experience, I think that we
could probably talk, literally, for days  &ndash; what the people
watching this video are really concerned about, I think, is what can
you help them understand better than they do at the moment about
what's really happening on this planet at the moment? What are the
agendas of the controllers? How much trouble are we in and what can
people do?

<br><br>

And
I want to put that question on hold because this is the purpose of
this video as far as we're concerned.

<br><br>

There's
a whole separate topic, which is a technological topic, because this
man we're talking to now has told us about technology that we didn't
know existed. My brain is still reeling over a conversation that we
had at breakfast this morning about which I'm going to say nothing.

<br><br>

Now,
before we start all of that &ndash; and that was a wonderful overview
that you gave about your intentions &ndash; can you give us a little
bit of a timeline of your career history which started when you were
very young? A little bit about the kind of things you've been
involved in? We're not asking you to name names, but we just want to
present you as somebody who people can get some kind of an idea of
who this person is that we're talking to whose name they haven't
heard before.
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I can do that. A very interesting thing we were talking
about... I have no idea where these thoughts came to me, but I know
that very early on in life I was so different from the people around
me that I thought that probably I fell from the sky in a titanium egg
and landed in my grandfather&rsquo;s orchard and my parents found me
there.
<br><br>

BR:
 And I think you're probably right, actually, having talked to you
for two days.

<br><br>

[laughter]
<br><br>

PP:
 Until I was about 22, I actually believed that.
<br><br>

DAVID
WILCOCK (DW):  [touching Pete on the shoulder with his finger] He is
real. He's solid.
<br><br>

PP:
 Then I quit believing that when I was in my mid-20s and in my last
few years &ndash; I'm nearly 70 &ndash; and in my last few years,
I've started believing that again. Because I find that the people I'm
stuck with here on this little spaceship Earth don't seem to have the
same view of <I>anything</I>.
It may be that I'm just wacky, but my wackiness has made a lot of
products and made a lot of sense to a number of people throughout my
life.

<br><br>

For
some reason I... well, it&rsquo;s probably genetics, because on both
of my parents&rsquo; sides I have long lines of geniuses that extend
back in history. I grew up in a home that was entirely powered and
heated and cooled, in a very temperate climate, was powered by the
sun and by atmospheric pressure change. It was a home that had a
gallery inside of it, much like Mexican <I>haciendas</I>,
but was covered, where we grew all of our meat products in the form
of chickens and rabbits and such, and where we grew all of our food
products.
<br><br>

BR:
 So you had an interesting and unusual upbringing.
<br><br>

PP:
 I had an interesting and unusual upbringing. We drove in cars that
my father made and invented. We lived in homes that my father built
out of strange materials that were very highly insulated. My dad was
a pioneer in tilt-up concrete buildings and was an engineer for the
military in my youth through the Second World War.
<br><br>

BR:
 And you were hand-picked and chosen for a special program when you
were as young as 13. Is this correct?
<br><br>

PP:
 Yes, I distinguished myself at age 10 by building a number of
rockets that held world altitude records, and by inventing a material
that's used even today to power solid-fuel rockets. That material got
out of my hands because I'm not a businessman, and wasn't a
businessman, and freely gave it away and other people capitalized on
it. But I liked explosions, and so, early on, started building
rockets.

<br><br>

BR:
 There's a wonderful story that you told us yesterday that we'd love
to say again very briefly. I'm going to be using the word <I>briefly
</I>in my
questions here with an apology, because we know that you could talk
with us, literally, for days about the extraordinary experiences
you've had, the things that you know, the things you've been told,
the things that you strongly believe with good reason. But one of the
stories that we wanted you to tell is what happened one day, when you
were ten years old, with a bunch of adults, and you had an
extraordinary experience.
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I'll preface that just a little bit with the fact that, as I
was growing up, it was in a very small country town about three
blocks long and not a lot of people. My parents had a home that had a
formal garden, and many of the local people would borrow that for
weddings and family reunions and things like that, which my parents
gladly lent them the facilities. There was a wedding that went on
and, as I remember, it was kind of in maybe June or July of 1950.
<br><br>

At
that point I had very limited educational resources in this tiny
town, but one of the books that got me very, very interested in
ancient peoples and anthropology and archeology was the book that was
written about the discovery of King Tut's tomb. About the time I
finished that book, it got me very, very excited to learn about the
Egyptians, and learn about the technologies that they had, and who
they were and how they built the Pyramids. A lecturer came to town,
the man who wrote the book <I>Kon-Tiki,</I>
Thor Heyerdahl. Then that got me excited, so I decided I wanted to be
an anthropologist-archaeologist and was dead set on it and reading
everything I could get through the state library system on that
subject.
<br><br>

Along
came this wedding, and just about as the preacher was to say the
words of destruction to the bride and groom, someone pointed up to
the sky and said: <I>What&rsquo;s
that? </I>And
everyone turned around &ndash; there were about 130 people there &ndash;
everyone turned around and looked. And for the next two hours
everyone at the wedding watched a series and groups of what I can
only call flying saucers flying through the air &ndash; some as close
as maybe 100 feet and some as far away as, maybe, 20 miles &ndash;
put on a spectacular show. Everyone there saw it, as did many people
in the surrounding community.



DW:
 Were they all the same?
<br><br>

PP:
 No, there were very different ones. Some were the shape of a pencil
and seemed to have windows along the periphery. Some were round like
a ball. Some were saucer-shaped with a bubble or a dome on top, some
saucer-shaped with two or three bubbles on the bottom. If you go back
and look through the various flying saucer sightings that we&rsquo;ve
heard about over the years, there was probably one or two of
everything we&rsquo;ve ever heard about. [laughs] These things would
dash away clear out of sight and come back. They would run away from
the people at the wedding party directly, so you were looking just at
one spot...
<br><br>

BR:
 And the significance of this is that, at this point, you made a
major life change. Right?
<br><br>

PP:
 At this point I made a major life change. I decided I was much less
interested in King Tut than I was in having my own flying saucer.
<br><br>

BR:
 Right.
<br><br>

PP:
 So immediately started studying science. I&rsquo;ve studied science
ever since, much of it toward the end of building my own flying
saucer. Over the years I came to the conclusion that to build a
flying saucer, you really needed to know first how to build what I
call a <I>Doctor
Who phone booth. </I>

<br><br>

For
those who don&rsquo;t know, Dr. Who was a British science fiction
spoof that runs on many stations in America about 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM,
and there&rsquo;ve been something like six or seven different <I>Dr.
Who&rsquo;s</I>
over the years, it&rsquo;s run so long. Dr. Who had a red British
phone booth...
<br><br>

BR:
 He didn&rsquo;t have a red British phone booth. He had a black
police phone box. It was a <I>police
</I>phone
box. It wasn&rsquo;t a red one.
<br><br>

PP:
 Ah. Okay, alright. He had a two-holer British phone booth and he
would go into it and it would become a time machine.
<br><br>

DW:
 It was called the TARDIS.
<br><br>

PP:
 It was called the TARDIS. So he was a Time Lord and he would travel
back and forth in both space and time. So, as I tried to figure out
how to build a flying saucer, I found out it was easier to build a
TARDIS. Then I got thinking: <I>Well,
who wants to just shove an aerodynamic body through air when you can
just simply get somewhere and dial your destination and walk out
where you are, and you don&rsquo;t have to push anything through the
air?</I>
<br><br>

Anyway,
I worked toward that end and have done many, many science projects,
some for large corporations, some for &ndash; we&rsquo;ll call them
&ldquo;agencies&rdquo; &ndash; and many of them for myself. I&rsquo;m
in the process now, at age 69, of building a laboratory to complete
the work that I&rsquo;ve done, and having acquired a number of very
special pieces of equipment for researching such things.

<br><br>

So
that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m about right now. I&rsquo;m in the process
of building that laboratory in a remote location where there are very
little man-made magnetic fields. We don&rsquo;t really get television
or radio direct much here and have very, very little man-made
interference &ndash; electromagnetic interference &ndash; and it
allows me to do my work that I need to do. So that&rsquo;s the life
change that happened when I was ten years old and so I&rsquo;ve been
on that pursuit ever since.

<br><br>

BR:
 And we would say <I>be
careful what you wish for </I>because
now you have the understanding, as far as you have told us in our
conversations so far, you have actually the understanding, if you
don&rsquo;t have the factory, to actually be able to make these
machines. You can also confirm that the Powers That Be on planet
Earth actually have access to this technology and use it for all
kinds of reasons. Is this correct?
<br><br>

PP:
 As far as I can tell, there are a number of governments that have
this technology. My feeling is, and/or my knowledge is, that it&rsquo;s
been acquired from people who came to this planet from off planet.
And it&rsquo;s been from the reading of a lot of ancient documents
dating back as far as 6,000 years.
<br><br>

BR:
 To the Sumerians.
<br><br>

PP:
 To the Sumerians. I have a Sumerian document that&rsquo;s been
translated that tells exactly how to build a flying saucer and it&rsquo;s
a direct translation. It probably doesn&rsquo;t give everything, but
it certainly gives the principles and I&rsquo;ve experimented with a
number of those principles and find out that things take place that
in modern physics aren&rsquo;t possible.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
worked with a group of scientists that have recently discovered
things in both mathematics and science that would lead me to believe
that the greater part of science that we have today &ndash; and I
have a PhD degree in Natural Philosophy, which they used to call
Physics, that took a lot of effort to acquire &ndash; and it leads me
to believe that these ancient documents portray knowledge that we
simply don&rsquo;t have, and that the knowledge we do have is wrong.

<br><br>

BR:
 And you&rsquo;ve been privileged to spend time in the Vatican
library. Is this something you can talk about on record?
<br><br>

PP:
 Uh... probably. Well, I can talk about things that... There is a lot
of information there that is very contrary to things that we believe
very deeply, both philosophically and scientifically, and that&rsquo;s
basically been held away from the public &ndash; it&rsquo;s not
common knowledge &ndash; a lot of translations which, I think,
probably came from the remnants of what didn&rsquo;t burn in the
Great Library of Alexandria, very ancient documents.

<br><br>

I
was involved, for a time, with machine language translation of a lot
of that material which was, in those days, somewhat crude but at
least it gave us some ideas. And the ones that looked good were later
translated by people who had done, you know, lifetime studies of the
language, and I think they&rsquo;re pretty fair translations.

<br><br>

BR:
 Are you able to say anything about anything that you learned about
the Anunnaki? Or is this off-record as well?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, the Anunnaki, who are written about in the Christian and
Jewish Bible texts... there are... I&rsquo;ve seen skeletons of what
we call <I>giants</I>.


<br><br>

There&rsquo;ve
been recent giants. They are, you know, people that would travel
around with traveling circuses and so forth that were very, very
large through genetic problems that they had; genetic errors. All of
them had joint problems; they had organ problems; they died young;
the bodies couldn&rsquo;t support the weight, things like that.

<br><br>

But
some of the skeletons don&rsquo;t show those anomalies that one would
see. They&rsquo;re very well-formed. They&rsquo;re very much like our
skeletons in many respects. They were written about in the Bible and
they were written about in other ancient texts, so one has to
believe...

<br><br>

I
know that there were numerous suggestions that DNA tests be run on
them once we got DNA testing pretty well down, and I know those have
been thwarted by various religions and various school bodies, people
not wanting to say that there are things that we don&rsquo;t
understand, or that they don&rsquo;t understand or that they don&rsquo;t
<I>want
</I>to
understand.
<br><br>

BR:
 But we human beings are from ET lineage -- are we not?
<br><br>

PP:
 My belief is that... I&rsquo;ll give you an example. Radio carbon
dating has become very, very accurate. We have very good records of
cave men that didn&rsquo;t have a language. Some drew pictures, some
didn&rsquo;t. We found caves with their tools in them, with the
evidences of their civilization, with their making crude tools and
things. There&rsquo;ve been a number of spots that those were found,
especially in Africa and Europe and the Middle East.

<br><br>

Then,
all of a sudden, over an 80-year period, emerged a civilization that,
for 3,000 years, had the same language and the same religion and the
same writing and the same mathematics, and was very, very advanced
from things that came afterward. And, you know, in modern history
since, oh, let&rsquo;s say 300 BC, we haven&rsquo;t had any
civilization that didn&rsquo;t change the language to where you
couldn&rsquo;t read it in a 300-year period.
<br><br>

BR:
 Sure. Yeah. Now, many of the viewers of this video will be aware of
the influence on ancient Sumeria, where this fully-developed
civilization seemed to appear from nowhere. I was just asking whether
you can confirm in any way what a lot of people suspect, which is
that we actually are, have been, created or engineered by ETs, who
knew what they were doing and who wanted to create us for special
purposes.
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I don&rsquo;t have absolute proof of that. That&rsquo;s one
reason I&rsquo;m building the laboratory here. But one of the things
I did notice in the late &lsquo;70s and early &lsquo;80s... I did a
lot of medical equipment engineering, and I designed a machine that
would read a field that surrounded the human body and could give you
a read-out on the condition of the organs, organ by organ, in the
body. Then it could locate or find, or even create, a medication that
would fix it. One of the things that I found was, in the early
beginning, that that machine could pretty accurately come up with a
diagnosis rate of 50 percent.

<br><br>


Of course, I wanted it
to be perfect and spent a number of years finding out that the reason
I didn&rsquo;t get over 50 percent was because a lot of people had
genetic errors in their genetic system. As a result of that, they had
disease processes that were based on those genetic errors. So you had
to treat them very different -- these people who had a disease that
was based on virii or germs, or other... parasites especially.

<br><br>

So
I finally got it to where about 70 to 75 percent of the diagnoses
appeared correct and the selection of medication treatment appeared
correct. Then I thought: <I>Well,
okay. There&rsquo;s 25 percent here that I really don&rsquo;t
understand.</I>
<br><br>

It
was about, oh, ten or fifteen years later that we got pretty familiar
with and pretty good with genetic testing, and I found that that 15
percent of people had very, very similar sequences in the DNA that
were unlike the other 85 percent of the people &ndash; and they were
unlike anything else on Earth. They appeared to be alien to the
Earth. So I thought: <I>Well,
that well could be through exposure to some form of solar radiation
or some type of ionizing radiation.  </I>

<br><br>

So
we looked at people that lived in areas that had natural radioactive
compounds, like the areas in southern Utah where a lot of the
carnotite and other uranium-bearing ores were mined and people that
spent time there, people that were in fallout zones of nuclear
testing at the nuclear test center in Nevada...
<br><br>

[Ed
note: a video splice begins here on a different topic]


We
sent the Gemini capsule up, and it went up &ndash; the first capsule
that went up &ndash; so we&rsquo;re all sitting in Mission Control
and called up and you know, <I>Ground
to capsule, Ground to capsule. Hello. Do you read us?</I>


<br><br>

[Pete
makes noise like muffled radio communication] ...comes back and there
was dead silence and then everybody laughed because we had the thing,
the last guy that went to work had to be the guy that ran for lunch,
and right down the street from JPL, right above the Rose Bowl, was
like one the first Jack-in-the-Boxes. And you&rsquo;d drive in and
you&rsquo;d order, and they&rsquo;d repeat order back and it&rsquo;d
come back [makes noise like muffled radio communication] and you
couldn&rsquo;t hear a word. So everybody realized that these
astronauts had taken their turn going and getting lunch, and
etcetera, etcetera, and everybody laughed and thought they were
simulating the Jack-in-the-Box effect.

<br><br>

It
turns out that that was the best communication that we had, so
immediately Chris Kraft turns to me and says: <I>Peterson!
Solve this problem.</I>
So I made a thing that we eventually called the &ldquo;Lecture
Laundry&rdquo; and it was a device that found out why such things
took place. And they still take place. You still go to drive-ins and
you can&rsquo;t understand a darn thing.
<br><br>

But
I built some no-noise microphones that also had a device that removed
all of that problem. We found out that there are three narrow pass
bands for all the information as speech is recorded.

<br><br>

Two
of them record the information. One of them gives you the
identification of the speaker. But that one pass band that gives you
the speaker identification has to have a variable frequency start&ndash;up
and drop-off. So you have little knob on it, so you turn it on in a
lecture [Ed. note: loudspeaker mode] and turn this knob until you can
hear the speaker very, very clearly. And you can hear them perfectly.
You don&rsquo;t hear the airplanes go over, the police cars go by,
people shuffling their papers, the noise from the cooling fan, the
noise from the rear projection fan, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

<br><br>

So
anyway, it&rsquo;s one of the little things out of my life. But I
used to build those and when I moved to build my new laboratory nine
years ago, I quit building those. So that&rsquo;s one of the products
I intend to get put back into production.
<br><br>

[Ed
note: end video splice here; the 15% alien DNA topic resumes.]
<br><br>

I
checked to see why I couldn&rsquo;t get the final 15 percent of the
diagnostic readings correct and finally came to the conclusion that
it was because these people had DNA that had come from off planet.
That led me to think: <I>Well,
if that&rsquo;s the case, there must be some kind of historical
record. </I>

<br><br>

And
when I went back and looked at the historical record, I found out
that there are numerous records and archaeological evidence that we
were visited by people from off planet &ndash; very probably, in my
opinion, not only off planet but extraterrestrial or
extra-Solar-System-type of visitors.

<br><br>

You
know, there&rsquo;s so many different people that claim having seen
such things, that they existed, seen such peoples. There are several
broad categories of such aliens. A few, a small percentage of those,
could be attributed to anything from paranoia to just tall tales or
whatever, but when you have as many as there are, all the way down
through all of recorded history, it leads one to believe that it
probably was very, very true that such things existed.

<br><br>

As
an example, anyone who wants to find something from the past, read
Ezekiel in the Bible.
<br><br>

BR:
 In the course of your work, have you encountered any documentation
about the existence of our relationship with creatures like that?
<br><br>

PP:
 I have. Most of them I can&rsquo;t talk about.
<br><br>

BR:
 Sure.
<br><br>

PP:
 But yes, I&rsquo;ve seen things written by scientists that I have
very high respect for. Some were teachers of mine. Some were people
that I work with scientifically in other fields, and there were
casual conversations about such things. That&rsquo;s why I have the
beliefs that I have, that we have extraterrestrial DNA in our
bodies... some of us do.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
rather interesting to note that there&rsquo;s been a lot of
supposition about various programs to reprogram people&rsquo;s minds,
to throw their thinking off, to cause them to believe things that
aren&rsquo;t necessarily true, but politically would be a very good
thing for those in politics and in government and in religion. It&rsquo;s
interesting to note that mind control techniques work on 85 percent
of the people, and the 15 percent that they don&rsquo;t work well on
are people that have that particular DNA string.
<br><br>

BR:
 Ah-ha. Okay.
<br><br>

PP:
 So, just another verification that those people are very different
from the average person.
<br><br>

DW:
 Pete, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re going to have tons of people
wanting to know, of this 15 percent DNA category, is it all one type
of person, like one race?  Or are they distributed throughout the
population? And if you can&rsquo;t tell us, you can&rsquo;t tell us.
<br><br>

PP:
 No, they obviously run in family trees, along family tree lines or
family lines, but they&rsquo;re pretty well distributed throughout
all different cultures and races.
<br><br>

DW:
 Thank you. I thought that was the case but I wanted that on record.
<br><br>

PP:
 Which, again, would be, to me, a confirmation that that probably did
happen because why would someone come and select just one race or one
family line?

<br><br>

BR:
 So there&rsquo;s black and white and red and...
<br><br>

PP:
 Red and yellow and green and blue and whatever.
<br><br>

KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  How about your DNA? Are you one of those?
<br><br>

PP:
 As far as I know, I am.

<br><br>

BR:
 We probably all are in this room. [laughs]
<br><br>

PP:
 We probably all are in this room. Matter of fact, I&rsquo;ve found
that, as the last ten or twelve years have progressed, I&rsquo;ve
noticed that many people, when I talk to them about things that I
know that are a fact in both science, mathematics and in history, as
well as in my belief system, I talk to certain people and the 85
percent that I don&rsquo;t seem to have a medical problem with, i.e.,
the ones that have &ldquo;normal&rdquo; human DNA...
<br><br>

BR:
 Don&rsquo;t seem to understand what you&rsquo;re talking about.
[laughs]
<br><br>

PP:
 When I talk to them, it used to be that they would call me crazy, or
it used to be that they&rsquo;d be really interested and want to
learn about it. But, nowadays when you talk to those people, when
you&rsquo;re done talking they don&rsquo;t say: <I>That&rsquo;s
crazy. You&rsquo;re crazy. I don&rsquo;t believe it. </I>They
come back into consciousness and start talking like you&rsquo;d never
said a word.
<br><br>

KC:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

BR:
 Yeah. Interesting. So the people watching this video are probably
among the 15 percent. They&rsquo;re self-selective in many areas,
this is what we find.
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, from what you&rsquo;ve told me about the people that you deal
with, I would believe that. They&rsquo;re probably in that 15
percent.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. Now, there&rsquo;s so many places we can go from this
conversation, but there&rsquo;s something important which I want to
grab, here and now, and that is: You made an allusion a few minutes
ago to when you moved here nine years ago to be in a very quiet,
secluded place with your laboratory which you are building to do your
work. What can you say about why you are here and why people who are
elsewhere might one day wish that they were also here?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, that's something that, in our talks over the last day or so,
we haven't really gotten into but I'm in an area that had two
requirements for me and for some of the people who I do various
things for that are not to be named.

<br><br>

One
of them is this area is very secluded from man-made electromagnetic
radiation. It's a deep valley with high mountains surrounding it in
360 degrees. The entrance to it is through a very narrow long,
winding canyon. So we don't really get radio here, or television,
directly. The power that comes in here does have interference on it
as well as it has information on it. But it's very, very secluded,
informationally.

<br><br>

Then
the place that I chose here is kind of back in a little notch in the
mountains, so it&rsquo;s even more secluded. That was one reason.

<br><br>

The
other reason is it&rsquo;s an area that&rsquo;s very highly
defendable. That was very important because of my belief, and the
belief of many other people that I have great respect for, that the
world is going through a... I&rsquo;ll call it a meltdown. We&rsquo;re
going through a change. The alternative-thought radio and television
shows and motion pictures and books and movies are all fraught with
the fact that something major is going to happen in 2010 or 2012 &ndash;
the end of the Mayan calendar, Earth changes, a number of things.

<br><br>

The
Yellowstone caldera is very, very active. There are areas up there
where the ground has risen. My understanding is it&rsquo;s risen
about four feet. We all know that there&rsquo;s got to be major
volcanic activity under Yellowstone area because we can go up there
and see the mud pots bubbling and Old Faithful geysering and smell
the sulfur coming out of Hades.
<br><br>

BR:
 And, metaphorically, the same thing may be happening politically.
<br><br>

PP:
 Exactly. The same thing happening politically. Best I can tell,
we&rsquo;ve been printing not only billions, but trillions of
dollars, with nothing to back them whatsoever. Right now I have very
dear friends in China that are offering me mature T-bills and mature
US bonds that they can&rsquo;t seem to get cashed, that they&rsquo;re
offering for 10 cents on the dollar.

<br><br>

And
there are trillions of dollars worth. It would be enough that, if the
world court system would enforce their eventual payment, every man,
woman and child in the United States would have to work for four or
five generations to pay them off.
<br><br>

BR:
 What&rsquo;s the connection between <I>that</I>
and your being <I>here</I>?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, that, and my being here is I&rsquo;m in an area that, because
if it&rsquo;s geographical location, has four seasons but it has a
good growing season. The area where I am exports both agricultural
and meat product in far greater amounts than the people here would
consume.

<br><br>

One
pry bar, or one stick of dynamite, would shut access &ndash; not
egress particularly &ndash; but it certainly would shut access off so
that if there were, indeed, a failure of the currency and ensuing
political and certainly geopolitical meltdown, this area would be
very protected from large groups of people with no money and
therefore no food and no energy and whatever. People who&rsquo;d come
looking for food would probably come to an area like this.

<br><br>

BR:
 Is there anything you can say about your belief of the likelihood of
these events transpiring?
<br><br>

PP:
 I&rsquo;ve been lead to believe in numerous briefings and people
that I know in fields that very definitely would know and so forth,
they&rsquo;ve all warned me that I should be at a place like this.
Many people, even those from Europe and other places, that had very
heavy financial connections in major cities around the world have
closed those offices down, and a great number of them have expressed
a desire to move here if they haven&rsquo;t already moved here.
<br><br>

BR:
 And you mean <I>here</I>
to this particular area?
<br><br>

PP:
 Here to this particular area.
<br><br>

BR:
 Uh-huh. So you believe that there is something very important
happening this year and this one of the reasons why you&rsquo;re
talking to us?
<br><br>

PP:
 That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m talking. I&rsquo;ve
kind of, if you would, come out of the closet because I think that
the people that I find have... The people now that are, say, 27 years
old and younger, have gone through a school system that hasn&rsquo;t
schooled them, hasn&rsquo;t trained them &ndash; obviously &ndash;
because if you know anything about education, has very specifically
not trained them and not schooled them in political science,
certainly, and in politics and in economics, and certainly
geo-economics. They just seem... they don&rsquo;t have an idea of
what&rsquo;s gone on.
<br><br>

You
know, we look at a President that complained entirely about all the
money that the previous President spent, then in the first 90 days
spent ten times as much. Now it was turned over to the Fed to spend
it and the Fed, in congressional testimony on television, said: <I>We
don&rsquo;t have any idea where that money went. We have no idea. We
can tell you where two billion of it went, but we certainly can&rsquo;t
tell you where seven trillion of it went, or six trillion of it went.
We don&rsquo;t have any idea.</I>
<br><br>

And,
you know, the people have just let that pass by: <I>Oh,
that means that ourselves and the next four generations of progeny
are going to have to work their whole lives to pay this debt off. </I>And
yet we don&rsquo;t even have any idea where it went or who has it.
It&rsquo;s certainly not out there helping the economy.
<br><br>

BR:
 Mm-hm. Now, if this occurs, would this be a worldwide problem? I
mean, like the collapse of the dollar...
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, it <I>is</I>
a worldwide problem. I mean, look back at James Burke's programs on
<I>Connections</I>.
The thing of it is &ndash; this is my opinion &ndash; but the Unions
had to do something to get the Union members to pay their dues, and
the only thing they really could do was increase their salaries. So
the Unions have increased their salaries to a point where the work
has had to move off-shore, because we don&rsquo;t have people that
are willing to work and be blue-collar workers anymore. They want to
work and get white-collar wages.

<br><br>

The
white-collar people want to get white-collar wages, rather than wages
that were consistent with their production so, in essence, they&rsquo;ve
stolen from the blue-collar workers and stolen from the rest of the
world by loaning them money and then taking all their natural
resources at very low rates.

<br><br>

This
has happened all over the world. It hasn&rsquo;t just happened here.
We&rsquo;re seeing economies beginning to fail everywhere. We&rsquo;ve
been dealing with a system now for, oh, 70 years or better, of fiat
money &ndash; money that&rsquo;s backed with nothing. It&rsquo;s like
was said about the Irish when they moved into New York and into
Boston: <I>Everybody
made money by taking in the neighbor&rsquo;s wash</I>.


<br><br>

BR:
 Sure. In your personal opinion, and if you can qualify that personal
opinion, it would be useful -- what do you think may happen if
there&rsquo;s some tipping-point of social instability or financial
instability that occurs before the end of this year? What can people
expect?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, let&rsquo;s take a look at the Depression in the late &lsquo;20s.
People had ethics. They had morality. Ethics and morality were
removed from the school systems 25 years ago, and for specific
reasons. It had nothing to do with reasons of ethics or morality. It
had to do with political reasons. So they were taken from the school
systems.
<br><br>

So
in the &lsquo;20s when we had a Depression, people would go out to
farmland and knock on the farmer&rsquo;s door and say: <I>Ma&rsquo;am,
I got three little kids that need to eat and I&rsquo;ll shovel
manure, I&rsquo;ll dig potatoes, I&rsquo;ll haul the weeds out of the
garden, I&rsquo;ll do whatever I need to do to get something to feed
my kids.</I>
<br><br>

Now
what people have been taught is that they&rsquo;re <I>owed</I>
a living, they&rsquo;re <I>owed</I>
to live like television says that people should live. They don&rsquo;t
have an ethic; they don&rsquo;t have a morality.

<br><br>

So
what happens is, if we have a financial collapse, it won&rsquo;t be
like the &lsquo;20s. It&rsquo;s going to be like today and you&rsquo;re
going to have anarchy and absolute chaos. The government knows that.
They&rsquo;ve recently asked the service members if they would fire
on civilians if they were asked to &ndash; which is <I>entirely
</I>against
the Constitution.

<br><br>

We
had a Second Amendment and the founders of our country, in writing
after the Constitution about where the Second Amendment came from,
didn&rsquo;t say that we should have the right to keep and bear arms
so that we could go get a deer and feed the family. They specifically
stated we had the right to keep and bear arms so that if the
government, with its military, got out of hand and tried to suppress
the Constitution and civilians, they could take control back, because
the government was supposed to lie in the hands of the people.
<br><br>

Now,
not that I believe that the people are smart enough to handle
themselves, because they&rsquo;re not, otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t
have had the last several Presidents that we&rsquo;ve had. We&rsquo;d
have actually had senators and congressmen thrown out because they
wouldn&rsquo;t do for us what was necessary. And the senators and
congressmen had no option because we had so many splinter groups that
they had to keep satisfied, that they couldn&rsquo;t do what was
necessary for the people as they were charged to do.
<br><br>

BR:
 Is there anything you can say on record about a recent Congressional
session that you attended?
<br><br>

PP:
 Yes. Uh... Probably better not said.

<br><br>

BR:
 Okay.
<br><br>

PP:
 Just note that there was the third... my understanding... it was the
third-ever closed session of Congress.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. I understand.
<br><br>

KC:
 But it is on Google, so...
<br><br>

PP:
 Yeah, I think many things have leaked out about it on Google. We
found that no matter where the politician was and what committee he
was on, when top secret things were talked about, they wanted to
close the session early, so they could get out and put their tips out
to the news. We don&rsquo;t have any confidentiality in that. It
leaked out, I&rsquo;m sure.
<br><br>

BR:
 Am I right in assuming that you wouldn&rsquo;t contradict those
leaks?
<br><br>

PP:
 I wouldn&rsquo;t contradict them at all.
<br><br>

BR:
 Thank you.
<br><br>

KC:
 But weren&rsquo;t they told to... weren't some of them getting out
of the country to relocate in South America? Ask him that.
<br><br>

PP:
 That&rsquo;s my understanding.
<br><br>

KC:
 George Green has given us testimony to that effect.
<br><br>

PP:
 Yeah. That&rsquo;s my understanding that a number of them felt that,
once the people found out what had been done to them by their
representatives, they felt that it would be much better for their
health and safety to be somewhere else.
<br><br>

BR:
 Mm-hm. And that kind of says it all. Do you know anything, or
suspect anything, about once the financial system fails, if it does
so, what would it be replaced by?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, up until a few days ago I would say it would&rsquo;ve been
replaced by a world currency. Remember, the last four Presidents have
all been members of the Council on Foreign Relations, and have openly
stated that they&rsquo;re moving toward a One World government and
believe we should have a One World government. If we had a One World
government, we&rsquo;d probably have a One World currency.

<br><br>

And
it might even be they were smart enough to have a currency that was
backed by something real, like gold or silver or various metals. I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to see a commodity-backed currency, so you could have a
currency that was worth so much corn, or so much wheat, or so much of
something that was a real, tangible thing.
<br><br>

BR:
 Sure. Up until a few days ago, you said. What changed?
<br><br>

PP:
 Up until a few days ago. What changed was my understanding is now
that they&rsquo;re... well, the NAFTA and GATT agreements basically
put us into a system where we had Mexico, United States and Canada
almost as one government with three parts.

<br><br>

There
was going to be a, you know, it&rsquo;s been highly rumored that
there was a printed currency available &ndash; pictures available on
the Internet, etcetera, etcetera, because there&rsquo;s nothing
that&rsquo;s a secret anymore &ndash; that would have currency,
different colors and different sizes for different denominations, and
was to be called something like the <I>Amero
</I>for
North America.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
been rumored that that currency is being destroyed now and replaced
by another U.S. currency that is being printed. And that would make a
lot of sense because there&rsquo;s so much... well, the money that&rsquo;s
being printed is <I>funny
money </I>because
it&rsquo;s backed on nothing. But also, there&rsquo;s been so much
counterfeiting, especially out of Iran. So you can look at some of
our politics with Iran having to do with nuclear proliferation, and
so much of it having to do with the fact that they have good printing
presses and good duplicators of paper and ink. There&rsquo;s been a
tremendous amount of currency that we know has moved here from Iran
that is counterfeit, and it&rsquo;s rampant.
<br><br>

BR:
 Yeah. Many people watching this video will be aware of what David
Icke has been talking about. We spoke to him at length earlier on
this year and one of the drums that he's been beating is about what
he feels is the danger of the population being <I>chipped</I>
as a means of control, which is going to be linked with their ability
to operate financially at all. Can you comment on that at all?
<br><br>

PP:
 There are a number of things to lead one to believe that they are
going to be shipping people around. There are a number of places that
there's no explanation for, but very large concentration camps have
sprung up, one of them very near where I live here that's very
large-sized.

<br><br>

On
the other hand, I was involved, back in the '70s, with a very large
food and feed company to build chips that could be used on prize
cattle and breeding cattle, for example, and show cattle, to
geolocate them or to identify them.

<br><br>

That
technology has now been reduced down to things that can be injected
through a hypodermic needle into the body and identify people. The
currency that I heard about that was to be a One World currency was
based on being chipped. The <I>credits</I>,
if you would, would go onto and off of that chip by a method similar
to Bluetooth that's used today.
<br><br>

BR:
 And this is technology which you yourself have helped develop! Is
that what I heard you say?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, it's technology that I developed, some of the early things,
and it's technology which, in it's smaller implementation, I'm using
right now in a product that I'm in the process of building for
geolocation and anti-theft because there's so many people being
kidnapped and sacrificed for their organs, or being kidnapped and
held for ransom &ndash; not the least of which is around the
Mogadishu area and in the Mediterranean, but also even in Mexico. A
tremendous number of people are being kidnapped for ransom there,
both their own people and visitors.

<br><br>

BR:
 There's a problem tracking containers.
<br><br>

PP:
 There&rsquo;s a problem tracking sea-land containers as well.
<br><br>

BR:
 Why is it important to track these containers?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, there are around 10,000 containers a day coming into the
country that are never physically inspected. We know that weapons of
mass destruction, though this is not totally announced, but we know
weapons of mass destruction are coming in in those containers. We
know terrorists are coming in in those containers because we see the
evidence of it afterward.

<br><br>

Thank
God the government has picked up a lot of these things later,
but the containers &ndash; a lot of them are shipping contraband. A
lot of them are shipping... You know, we saw the dog food come in
that was laced with Melamine, because it wasn't inspected.
<br><br>

BR:
 Now, we just did a tape change here, and just before that little
interlude, David was very keen to ask Pete about his view about how
can we transform these danger signs into something that is a healthy
warning to us? What sorts of proactive, positive-thinking,
responsible actions can we take without just blindfolding ourselves
and ignoring whatever real risks that might be there?

<br><br>

Now
this is my bridge because I want David to ask his own questions. This
is one of the reasons why he's here with us. We have a huge respect
for David, his intellect, his perspective, his experience. David,
this is all yours. You want to talk to Pete about this very important
thing here.
<br><br>

DW:
 Sure. What I wanted to say was just that I have a perspective, which
includes documenting my dreams every day for the last 17 years,
following their guidance, getting accurate information from that
guidance. Yesterday morning, while we were talking about all these
things, I had a dream in which there was a volcanic eruption. It
looked terrifying. There were rocks flying into the air and everybody
around me thought we were all going to die. We ran under these trees,
the rocks fell all around us, but we were all fine. Nobody was
actually hurt by it. Obviously it was a disaster, obviously it had
caused property damage, but the people were okay.
<br><br>

That's
one of many different varieties of data that I've gotten to suggest
that, even though things look like they could be really austere and
apocalyptic, that humanity will persevere through this and that we
will be able to have a positive outcome on our own futures, and that
this is not a situation that's completely outside of our ability to
manage.
<br><br>

PP:
 Well David, you had a question that you asked me just before the
break and I think we're going to agree to disagree, but go ahead and
ask that question again, or make that statement again.
<br><br>

BR:
 It was a very good question. It was about prior warnings not having
come to pass and therefore why should we be concerned?
DW:
 Oh, okay. Yeah, let me give you some prelude to that. I spoke with
another witness who was involved in various compartmentalized
projects, one in particular which was at the Montauk base, and he had
extensive contact with people on the inside.

<br><br>

One
of the things that he said was that the Superdomes that were built in
all the major cities were intended to be large holding containers for
people to be herded in. He said that there was a plan that the Rodney
King riots would foment enough social upheaval that they would be
able to actually round up black people who were rioting in the cities
and put them inside these domes and basically keep them in there
until they passed away.

<br><br>

That
was a plan that was made and it obviously did not happen. So, we've
heard from many Project Camelot witnesses&rsquo; similar plans,
timelines, in which the Powers That Be, whoever they are, say
apocalyptic things are going to happen. The dates come, strange
things happen, yes, but it doesn't lead to an apocalypse scenario.

<br><br>

So,
in private conversation with us, you had mentioned that there were
other dates that came and went where they had said something like
this might happen. Some friends of yours inside told you something
like that and then it didn't actually turn into a social breakdown.
<br><br>

PP:
 Yes.

<br><br>

DW:
 Okay.
<br><br>

PP:
 I did say that, and so the question is?
<br><br>

DW:
 Well, the question is, in terms of... You had mentioned before that
people have a conditioning to not think, and a conditioning of mind
control. You said that there is a degradation in the moral fabric of
our society. So, I think what we really need to know on a personal
level is: What can we do to help ourselves not be indoctrinated by
this passive programming that's coming out to us? You mentioned
versions of mind control and things like that. I think that's an
important key to not getting stuck in this trap.
<br><br>

PP:
 I moved here because I was told by various people that I should
geolocate and be in an area that would be safe when we eventually got
a financial and, therefore, a political, collapse. So there're
certain things that I've done to make sure that myself and my family
and my friends are safe from that.

<br><br>

The
question that David just asked is a little bit different, having to
do with the fact that numerous ones of us have heard a bit
apocalyptic things in the future, ranging from the fact that,
supposedly in the year 2011 or 2012, we have the end of the Mayan
calendar and we have an apocalypse coming. People who are apocalyptic
Christians say about the same thing, that the End Times are here or
coming. We've heard very dire things about the economic posture of
the United States and the whole world, and we see things happening.

<br><br>

We
see Iceland, for example, declaring bankruptcy, and I hear from
people that I know in the banking system that a number of the
European states are going to follow them in bankruptcy. When the U.S.
currency fails... which I can't imagine that it won't, because we've
printed so much currency and put out there that's backed by nothing
-- it's all beginning to come home and roost. The T-bills and bonds
are coming back to us, and I can't see what's going to happen there.

<br><br>

We
have the huge collapse that when, before the current President took
office, 16 billion dollars was going to solve all the problems, and
<I>Please
get this bill through</I>,
and <I>We
can take 16 billion dollars and put it out in. </I>And
it barely passed and we got that through.

<br><br>

Then
it seemed like three weeks later we didn't know where the 16 billion
dollars was even supposed to go or what for because they passed the
bill without even knowing what was going to happen. That 16 billion
dollars disappeared immediately. And now, all of a sudden we needed
seven or nine trillion dollars, and then we needed 20, you know, and
we don't have any idea where <I>that
</I>went.
<br><br>

So
the things we've heard in the past about there going to be a failure,
the time came and left and there wasn't a failure, but this money was
pumped somewhere. And, of course, the system had a lot more inertia
than we anticipated. So now what we have is something that... the
actuality is coming to roost. I drive around in the town that I live
nearby, the large town that's about 50 miles south of me, and I drive
around there and I look in the little malls and I look in the big
malls. The big mall has closed. We only had one mall in the town, and
the gross population [of] nearly, well, 750,000 people.

<br><br>

The
one mall that we had, the people that had the mall failed and went
bankrupt, and it's closed. All the stores that sell non-essential
items &ndash; jewelry stores, bed and bath stores, etcetera &ndash;
most of them have closed. Sporting goods stores, most of them have
closed.

<br><br>

BR:
 What you're saying is that we haven't been here before. This is
something new.
<br><br>

PP:
 So we haven't really ever been here before. You know, we've heard
that things are going to happen, things are going to fail, but life
continued on as normal and the government continued to print money
and pass it out to its friends and so forth. So, therefore, we're in
a bit different set of circumstances. I moved here in 1999 because I
was told [that] by 2001, that the system was going to fail. And here
we are eight years later, or nine years later...
<br><br>

BR:
 In fact, you were <I>ordered</I>
to come here.
<br><br>

PP:
 I was. So, we found out that no, it didn't fail. I'd go for a
briefing and they'd just be in shock: <I>We
don't understand it. We don't have any idea why it hasn't failed. I
mean, we just don't know. The only thing we can do is say there was
so much inertia.</I>
<br><br>

So,
now it's beginning to fail. And it isn't just beginning to fail --
it's increasing on a logarithmic scale, and very shortly, I see that
it just about has to do that. Which then brings us back to the first
question that David asked just before the break was: <I>What
do I see that we could offer the listeners out there, something that
they might do?</I>
And I can say: <I>Well,
in my personal opinion...</I>
<br><br>

And
what I've done, I've put my money and my talent, my skills and my
abilities, where my mouth is. I've come here and I'm self-sufficient.
I grow all my own meat, all my own vegetables. I have stored up those
things that are going to be critical to society. I've picked up the
tools that I didn't have that allow me to do things in such an
environment and such a society to produce things that are going to be
necessary for people to have.
<br><br>

BR:
 And you can even make your own radio and probably fuel your own
truck.
<br><br>

PP:
 Exactly right. I have a number of vehicles that I now have --
engines that'll burn alcohol. I have the equipment and I have the
seeds and I have the tractor, and I have the land and I have the
water to grow material that I can make alcohol from at a much larger
rate than I need.
<br><br>

BR:
 Now, a lot of people listening to this will say: <I>But
I'm in the middle of a big city. I've got a wife and a mortgage and
two kids who are at school, and I hear what you're saying but what
can I do? I'm not in that situation. </I>What
would you tell them?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I've taught survival for better than 40 years and my
particular area of expertise in survival was urban survival. I was
asked to write a book about urban survival, and I started the book
out, and I can tell you that &ndash; we got into that a little bit
earlier &ndash; I can tell you that today there isn't any such thing
as urban survival. Who knows their neighbors? In '29 people knew
their neighbors and they had ethics and morality. Now the ethics and
morality has been taken away from the children, and the children are
now in their 20s and 30s.

<br><br>

BR:
 The community's gone.
<br><br>

PP:
 The community is gone. We don't have a community that would do that,
and we have people that have children, and now some of them have a
couple children. What are you going to do when your kids say: <I>Daddy,
my tummy hurts. I haven't had anything to eat for two weeks.</I>
And you smell the next door neighbor over there, who was a wise
squirrel and put something up, and you smell him out on his barbeque
- because he's got no power but charcoal - cooking a couple of
freeze-dried steaks? You have to ask yourself: <I>What
would that person do?</I>
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. But there are a lot of psychological operations that have been
put in place in preparation for all of this, and there's mental
self-defense or mental preparation, emotional preparation, spiritual
preparation. Is there something that you can speak to about that,
whatever people's circumstances are?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I will do that, but first I want to suggest that... Take a
look at just the things that have happened. Forget the
political-economic situation. Let's take a look at things that have
happened in this country over the last, say, four or five years.

<br><br>

You've
got the debacle that occurred in New Orleans, and then you've got the
next debacle that occurred in Texas and Mississippi, and you got to
see that, no, all those people couldn't leave town because they got
out on the freeway and the freeway was jammed. Everybody got stopped
and they ran out of gas and there wasn't any gas. The people that
owned the service stations left to get out of town also, so there
wasn't anything for the service stations.
<br><br>

You
look at New Orleans. I knew people that were getting water to New
Orleans that had been ordered, it was a year until it got delivered.
There were people who got thousands and thousands of trailer-houses
that were stuck in the Midwest and never got shipped down there.
Nobody got to use them. But by the time they got where they could've
put them down there, the things had already decayed, and they found
out they were made with the wrong materials and they were out-gassing
toxic things...
<br><br>

That
was how well the government was prepared for that. They saw it coming
and saw it coming and saw it coming &ndash; nothing happened. Then
you look at the people that live along the Mississippi River and its
feeding tributaries. They've had floods virtually every year. Every
year they have floods, and they go back and they rebuild their houses
with lots of insurance money, and then they have floods the next
year...
<br><br>

The
weather is changing. I think it's changing to the colder rather than
the warmer, but anyway, the weather is changing, very definitely.
It's changing right here where I live, tremendously so. In the last
couple of winters, we've had two-to-three times the snow that we had
the previous ten years. Then we've had water from it, major, major
water problems. We had droughts for a number of years. I live near a
huge, huge reservoir that holds enough water to irrigate the whole
southern state for a year or two, and it's been absolutely dry in the
bottom, hardly a trickle. And now it's clear full and spilling over.
<br><br>

BR:
 So, in summary, you're saying that as a scientist and as an
intelligent man, as somebody who is well-connected on the inside with
other scientists and other intelligent men, you think that there's a
real problem.
<br><br>

PP:
 I think that there's a major real problem and I think that people
who don't see that, and don't realize that, simply have put blinders
on. I think that what they should do is think: <I>You
know, maybe there's something to this. </I>But
at least we see that in major areas of the country there've been
problems where people needed to have a little supply of food left
because they couldn't get to a store.

<br><br>

They
need to have things that, if they have to leave their homes... Like
in the area that I'm in, and in California, especially, and in other
states, especially. There've been major, major fires that have gone
on. People have been moved out of their homes. And when they left
home and they came back and they're crying on television: <I>Oh,
everything's gone. Everything's gone.</I>
<br><br>

And
yet, some of those people went to survival lectures that I gave and
they had copies of their driver's license, copies of their marriage
license, copies of their insurance papers, copies of all the things
they needed to have copies of. They had extras of all the children's
pictures and extras of the journals and so forth put away in another
location. These are things that people can do to assure continuity
even though there may be something coming.
<br><br>

California?
We hear predictions about earthquakes all the time and we <I>see</I>
earthquakes all the time. Some are small and some are larger, but we
hear the people that actually are predicting those things predicting
very large earthquakes. They don't know if it's going to be next year
or the year after, but they know it's going to come, they know it's
going to be large, they know people are going to lose things. Why
don't these people have what's called a <I>bug-out
bag </I>in
their car where they could take off and leave the area?
<br><br>

The
government says: <I>Oh,
you only need to have three days storage. </I>But
we look at where the government's come in, time after time after time
over just the last four or five years, and found out the government
didn't have anything for them. They had to fend for themselves. It
was months, sometimes, before they had effort come in.

<br><br>

It's
very interesting to understand... When I teach a survival class, one
of the things I do is, right at the beginning of the class I put a
velvet bag over people's head. Then I tell them: <I>I'm
going to place a ten dollar gold piece somewhere in the room and have
you all look for it. Whoever finds it gets to keep it. </I>

<br><br>

So
I do that and then I say: <I>Okay,
go look for it, </I>and
immediately someone says:<I>
Oh, here it is. I have it. I found it.</I>
And everybody takes their bag off and says: <I>Well
that's no fair! He didn't have a hood on!</I>
<br><br>

And
I say: Okay,
so let's say that there's a big earthquake or a big emergency, and if
you don't have a way of communicating
&ndash; because
the cell phones are going to be down, the radio stations are going to
be down &ndash;
if you
don't have a way of communicating outside of those, it's like having
a bag over your head.<I>
</I>You're
not going to know what roads are blocked. You're not going to know
what roads have police that are not allowing people to go through.
You're not going to have gasoline in your car.

<br><br>

If
you had a short-wave radio or an amateur radio, which are very
inexpensive, you could listen to the radio amateurs who are going to
be immediately there because that's what they're set up for, that's
what they're trained to do. If you had an amateur radio license,
which anybody can get these days, it's like you had eyes. You can see
where to go, where there's problems, where there are not problems,
where there are riots, where there are not riots, and carry on and go
there.

<br><br>

If
you had a bug-out bag in your car you'd have gas and fuel and medical
supplies, things to keep you warm, things to keep you cool, all
packed up ready to go. Just a small bag. So, there are a number of
things that one could do to become aware.
<br><br>

BR:
 There&rsquo;s a lot that has been done to dumb down the population.
How can this be reversed? How can that be aided? I want to make sure
that David gets a chance to answer his own questions. What I'm trying
to do is support you in that and I want to give you air time here.

<br><br>

DW:
 There is a compartment of reality that we can talk about in which
people are on this planet and there are forces that appear to be
almost outside their control to do anything about other than, as you
said, preparations for the sake of survival. Then we also have
another context which is that you are apparently directly aware of
extraterrestrials who are not strictly negative. In fact, you
mentioned to us before that a lot of them are positive. We know
they're out there, we know they're visiting us.
<br><br>

While
I don't believe they're going to just come down and save us from
problems, there appears to be a greater reality that we are all
involved in, and that this situation...  My understanding is that the
situations we're going through are going to be instrumental in
helping to purge the negative influences on this planet that have
been prevailing for so long, not make them worse. There will be,
certainly, a crisis time that we go through but that's part of a
passage into a more organized and enlightened society. That's how
it's been explained by many different accurate sources, in my
opinion, including ancient prophecies that speak of the coming of a
Golden Age.
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, one of the things that I did in studying survival was I went
to numerous places on the face of the Earth where there were
survival-type things taking place, whether it be genocide in Africa,
whether it be eruption of volcanoes, whether it be tornadoes and
tsunamis. I've gone to those places studying survival, and I know one
thing: There's one person I can rely on and that's me, and all the
rest is conjecture.

<br><br>

I
found out that the people that survived were the people that were
prepared. Some were prepared mentally, and that's the major
preparation that you could do. But I know that when you believe in
other people, that may or may not happen, but if you believe in
yourself and follow up, it does happen and you don't have any worry.

<br><br>

I
found out that a few days or a few hours, or even a few minutes can
be the difference between life and death. So I would just as soon
spend a little time and a little effort and a little money, and be
able to take care of myself and my people. And if other things
happen, so much the better; I have things I can share with others.
<br><br>

DW:
 Yeah, I don't dispute that at all. In fact, I am very well prepared
for eventualities in myself. We also, at Project Camelot, have
interviewed enough different witnesses that we are trying to look at
the big picture perspective.

<br><br>

I
do believe that we have an intelligently-guided planet. I do believe
that the things that happen on the planet are not random, and I do
believe that society itself is going through an evolutionary process.
A lot of the things that you've shared with us already, off the
record, reveal that there are potentials of the human being much
greater than what we currently understand.

<br><br>

You&rsquo;ve
also suggested there are efforts to suppress our natural ability that
have been put in place and I think that, while, absolutely, preparing
is important, I think anything you can tell us about how people can
strengthen their intuitive faculty, so that they have an ability to
get in touch with that part of themselves that does have the
knowledge &ndash; you've mentioned remote viewing before, too.

<br><br>

<br><br>

If
they have some way, something you can share with us, a way in which
people can greater empower themselves to the greater awareness that
they actually possess and how that could help them through these
transitional times, maybe that would be important to hear.

<br><br>

PP:
 Well, actually, strangely enough, we really agree and I think we're
both saying that one should do both, because then you don't have to
rely on anything; you don't have to rely on somebody else.

<br><br>


That's the problem.
What's been taken out of people over the last 20 years is
response-ability. People have to take responsibility.

<br><br>

Over
the millennia, the people that we've considered major, major
prophets, such as the prophets of Mohammedanism, the prophets of
Christianity, prophets of record such as Nostradamus and so forth.
Every one of those, and all the religions, have said: <I>Take
responsibility and prepare yourself. </I>

<br><br>

The
things that David&rsquo;s talking about to prepare are exactly
correct. People should have those skills. They should go out and
practice those and I know that your group has been superb in
providing evidence and providing a website that's a fantastic website
where they can go and look and find out people that are talking about
such things, people that are saying such things.
<br><br>

I'm
basically a warrior because that's kind of my path and I've noticed
that there isn't anybody out there in this world that's taking care
of me except me. That's not necessarily true because the knowledge,
the intellect, the experience, the vast experience that I have has
been handed to me on a silver platter. It's like I stuck my hand in
the air to volunteer and got a hiccup in my rotator cuff and my hand
just stayed up and I ended up volunteering for everything. [Kerry
laughs]

Everybody
thought I was volunteering, and so I got stuck into a number of
different things. But none of it, as I look back on it, was by
accident.

<br><br>

I
know that there are a number of people that were students of mine
that were in New Orleans, that were in the Gulf area of Texas, that
were in the river areas in Ohio and Nebraska and so forth, and
Tennessee. I know that all of them, when the time came, just simply
threw a bag in the back of their car and headed out and they were
fine. All their family records were preserved, and all their family
jewels and things, everybody knew where they were. They were all in
one place, threw them in the car and off they went. The car was full
of gas with a little trailer with a couple of gas cans and a tent.
And they were fine.
<br><br>

I'm
just suggesting that that is a very wise thing to do on a day like
today, whether the prophets of doom are correct, or whether they're
not correct. Let's say you put aside five months worth of food. Well,
go take a look at the prices in the store, and the prices five months
ago, and tell me you wouldn't like to buy five-months-ago&rsquo;s
food, or today's food at five-months-ago&rsquo;s prices. You know,
it's better than any investment you could've made. It's better than
any stock I know of. It's even better than gold. If a disaster comes,
it's going to be worth far more than gold because it'll save your
life, where gold will just get you robbed &ndash; or silver.

<br><br>

I
tell people if you're going to save gold, for crying out loud, save
some silver. Because if we have a collapse, when it comes, you know,
get yourself a wheelbarrow and if you come to my place and want a
loaf of bread and you've got an ounce of gold that's worth, at that
time, $2,000, I'll swap it for a loaf of bread. [laughter] If you've
got a quarter, that by that time is worth three dollars &ndash; a
non-numismatic silver quarter &ndash; I'll swap it for a loaf of
bread. Take your pick.
<br><br>

BR:
 Right.

<br><br>

PP:
 So, there are things that people can do to do that, and there are
things that they can do. There are a number of remote viewing courses
and many of them are very good. I&rsquo;d suggest you do remote
viewing.

<br><br>

But
I said besides remote viewing I know one thing that's certain. I can
take my little ham radio and I can pick it up and I can call on the
ham radio repeater and I say: <I>What's
the traffic like on Route 17 going out through Palmdale? </I>And
somebody's going to say: <I>Oh,
all the cars are stopped and they're not letting people through. </I>Or
they're going to say: <I>Oh,
the traffic's flowing just fine. </I>And
I know that's the direction to get out of town.
<br><br>

BR:
 Sure. A lot of people would want us to ask this question. It's
almost a matter of duty. And that is: How much does Obama know about
all of this, in your opinion?
<br><br>

PP:
 Uh... [laughs] That's a strange question. I can't imagine anyone
accepting the job of President with the current situation. I can't
imagine that. So, in that respect, I have to say he can't be very
intelligent. On the other hand, he's an intelligent man. He certainly
is an intelligent speaker. Of course, he was a debate king, if you
would.

<br><br>

I
know that when he got his first briefing, because I had friends that
were present, said that he was so shocked that he had to sit down
when he found out what really was happening. This was before he took
the office. Now, I think that he's found himself in a river that's
flooded and headed south and he's got a little boat with no oars.

<br><br>

BR:
 And very steep canyon walls. [laughs]
<br><br>

PP:
 And steep canyon walls, and he's just paddling with his hands as
fast as he can paddle and trying to do the very best job that he can.
He has a few really good people around him. I really don't believe he
has a hint how to stop what's happening. I don't think he has a hint
how to stop the flood, because it's behind him and it's coming on,
and he's being driven by it and there's not much he can do.
<br><br>

BR:
 Now, speaking about having good people with him, just using that
turn of phrase, would you confirm that there <I>are</I>
good people, who we have euphemistically called the White Hats, in
the government and the intelligence and the military, who themselves
are patriots as you are, and they're trying to do their best from the
inside to avert these things.
<br><br>

PP:
 Absolutely. There are many people that left the military. Most of
the good people left during Clinton and Bush because they couldn't
pledge allegiance to the President because of the things that were
being done, so many people left. On the other hand, there were many
people that stayed behind because they knew they were going to be
needed. They sacrificed, not principle, but they had a higher
knowledge and stayed behind so that they could ply the knowledge that
they had when the time came.
<br><br>

BR:
 That's where they thought they would be most valuable.
<br><br>

PP:
 That's where they thought they would be most valuable, and they were
the true patriots because they did what was best for the people
rather than what was best for themselves.
<br><br>

BR:
 And these are the people who are keeping you informed sometimes. Is
that right?
<br><br>

PP:
 Some of those people are the people that are keeping me informed.

<br><br>

BR:
 I understand.
<br><br>

PP:
 I mean, it's more that they're keeping me informed because they call
me for ideas. I'm kind of an idea man and they call me and ask me:
<I>What
might we do here, and what might we do there?</I>
<br><br>

BR:
 Because you're above all a problem solver and a technological...
<br><br>

PP:
 I'm basically a problem solver.
<br><br>

BR:
 Mm-hm.
<br><br>

DW:
 Do you think there's ever going to be a Disclosure? That any of this
stuff about UFOs or other races not born on Earth would ever get out
to the public?
<br><br>

PP:
 It's interesting. I've been told that a number of the apocalypse
films that have come out recently, and a number of the science
fiction things that have come out recently as movies have been
partially funded by the government wanting to get familiar in our
minds the idea there might be people that could come and help us.
There might be some kind of Divine providence that would help as
well. I've heard, kind of through the grapevine, that...

<br><br>

I
know that Reagan was asked to disclose such things, the truth about
flying saucers and alien people. I know that JFK was asked those
things and said he would do something. And I know there was pressure
put to bear on both of them to say nothing. I know that the current
President... I don&rsquo;t know this. I <I>have
heard</I>
that the current President was planning to make such announcements
later in the year, or late in the year.
<br><br>

KC:
 Are you willing to say the date and that information that you...
<br><br>

PP:
 I know a date I was told, and I can tell you the same people that
told me that date told me that the U.S. currency would fail in 2001
when they ordered me to move here.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay.
<br><br>

PP:
 So who knows what's going to happen? But I've heard that his
desire... And I may be wrong. I don't know. I've heard it through the
grapevine, the man hasn't told me himself.
<br><br>

KC:
 But he's under orders, isn't he? He's just the front guy.
<br><br>

PP:
 My feeling is that we haven't had a President since right after
George Washington that wasn't under orders from someone else. If you
go back and take a look at it, it's pretty obvious.

<br><br>

BR:
 Then, if the guy doesn't obey those orders, he may find himself in
trouble.
<br><br>

PP:
 He may find himself in trouble.
<br><br>

KC:
 Do you want to talk about who&rsquo;s behind him, at all?
<br><br>

PP:
 I really don't.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay.
<br><br>

DW:
 About the announcement, though. You were working up to an
announcement. You were saying that he may announce something at the
end of the year? What would that be? What does your grapevine tell
you?
<br><br>

PP:
 My grapevine tells me that he is going to announce that there are
indeed such things as flying saucers, and there is indeed technology
transfer, and there is indeed beings behind it that didn't come from
this planet.
<br><br>

KC:
 How many different kinds?
<br><br>

PP:
 I... You know, we're getting into speculation here that...

<br><br>

BR:
 Understand.
<br><br>

PP:
 You know, whether the person that told me would know, I have no
idea. Whether the President would know, I have no idea. Whether we
even know, I have no idea. But a number of them, more than, say,
three or four.

<br><br>

BR:
 Good.
<br><br>

PP:
 Again, if you go back and look at the number of people who seem to
have seen such people, you get kind of a: <I>Well,
there's a reptilian type, and there's a long-face type and a
round-face type and a tall type and a short type and... </I>

<br><br>

It
isn't just like one person said this and one person said that. It's
50 people in the U.S. and 20 people in Germany and 300 people in
Brazil and 80 people in Africa say this. Then for the next bunch
there's maybe 40 or 50 in Russia and 25 or 30 in Germany. You know,
you can't discount all of those things when, from totally disparate
regions that have no real communication, and people have no real
communication with each other, you have people doing exact
descriptions and large amounts of exact descriptions.
<br><br>

BR:
 Yeah. And tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, reporting
contact with the little guys with the almond-shaped eyes and the big
heads, who many people say are responsible for abductions. Do you
know anything about that at all?
<br><br>

PP:
 All I know is that I've talked to a number of those people and many
of them seem to me to be very credible. Many of them seem to me to
have read somebody else's report and then they wanted to be in the
thing and made it up.
<br><br>

BR:
 Are any of these abductions military operations?
<br><br>

PP:
 I wouldn't have any idea.
<br><br>

BR:
 You don't know. Okay.
<br><br>

[Ed
note: video splice begins here.]
<br><br>

PP:
 Look, I can't see why the dollar didn't crash in 2001, absolutely
couldn't see why it didn't crash. Because it was backed with nothing.
It was inertia, in my opinion, it was inertia <I>only
</I>that
carried it on. And sure, there were a lot of people behind the scenes
manipulating various things. You saw how they manipulated billions
and billions of dollars that didn't even... not only were bogus
dollars, i.e. dollars that were printed with nothing behind them,
dollars that didn't even exist!
<br><br>

People
fail to look at this fact. If, let's say &ndash; we&rsquo;ll use just
round figures &ndash; let&rsquo;s say that there's $1,000 issued,
okay? Who issues the dollars? The Fed issues the dollars &ndash;
totally outside of the Constitution, as far as I'm concerned.
<br><br>

The
Fed issues $1,000. They then rent those dollars to the bank. What
does the bank do? The bank rents those dollars out to people so they
can by a car, a home, whatever. They say: <I>We'll
rent this out to you and it'll be at five percent interest. </I>



Now,
what that means is they've taken a thousand &ndash; and if they have
$1,000, the banks are allowed to loan out $17,000. So let's say you
have ten percent interest on $17,000. Now that's $10,000 plus another
$7,000. Where does the $7,000 come from to pay it back? It wasn't
ever issued. It didn't ever exist. How can they pay back more than
there <I>ever
was</I>?
And people don't understand the concept of fiat money!
<br><br>

KC:
 Right. There are many videos on Google that people can watch on this
very subject and get educated.
<br><br>

PP:
 Yeah. Absolutely! And the problem is that people have been taught
that if you just stick your head in the sand and don't look, it isn't
going to bite you.
<br><br>

BR:
 Keep on watching <I>American
Idol</I>
and you'll be all right.
<br><br>

PP:
 Keep on watching <I>American
Idol</I>,
and keep on going to the movies, and keep on, you know, whatever.
<br><br>

DW:
 I'd like to say one thing. There is footage that you can see of an
announcement that Rumsfeld made on September 10th, 2001, about money
that was &ldquo;lost&rdquo; in the military budget to the tune of 2.3
trillion dollars &ndash; the day before September 11. So is that in
anyway related to what you&rsquo;re talking about with the year 2001?


<br><br>

PP:
 Probably is, and there are a number of other things. Let&rsquo;s
look at what happened on September 11th. [laughs] A building that
wasn&rsquo;t even involved crashed to the ground, and in the basement
of it was stored a massive amount of gold. It was never found.
[laughter] Okay? Never found! And why would that building fall down?
Not even ashes fell on it. It was out of the wind pattern.
<br><br>

DW:
 Right.
<br><br>

PP:
 Where did that money go, and why did that building fall down?
<br><br>

KC:
 Well, do you know the answer?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I think I know the answer but I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m
convenient with giving that answer. Because, you know, I don&rsquo;t
want to prompt somebody to go look for it because I know what I feel
they&rsquo;d find. I think what they&rsquo;d probably find is an
early grave.
<br><br>

BR:
 By now people watching this video will understand why we were so
keen to introduce Pete to this audience, and will understand what we
were saying when we referred to twelve hours of off-record
conversation yesterday, that we haven&rsquo;t even begun to bottom
out even so.

<br><br>

What
we&rsquo;re able to provide here is only a very short summary of some
of the things which Pete knows. So, with apologies, we&rsquo;re going
to move on because we&rsquo;ve only got a certain amount of time and
a certain amount of tape, to other areas because there&rsquo;s an
extraordinary amount of experience and information which you may want
to share.

<br><br>

Let
me, first of all, ask you if you&rsquo;re willing to share any of
your experience about working with Russian scientists, and in what
capacity you did that?
<br><br>

PP:
 Yes, I&rsquo;d be more than happy to do that... [sighs] some of it,
at least. After the fall of the Wall, I went to Russia and worked
with a number of top scientists there that were involved in their
space program.
<br><br>

BR:
 And you went to Russia, let me say euphemistically, in a
professional capacity?
<br><br>

PP:
 In a professional capacity. I came by invitation and went there. One
of the things we did was, we took &ndash; and I&rsquo;m going to use
<I>Russia</I>
in general terms, meaning the old Soviet Union.

<br><br>

BR:
 The U.S.S.R.
<br><br>

PP:
 I went to various countries that were at one time part of the
U.S.S.R.

<br><br>

I
was there, for example, when Ukraine declared their independence, and
I knew the man who was the first president there. So we took out of
the U.S.S.R. a lot of technology that had been pent up, and brought
back, and donated it to the government here.

<br><br>

I
got to see brilliant, brilliant, brilliant technology that &ndash;
some we knew about, some we had, and some we didn&rsquo;t have,
specifically in materials science and in things that could be used to
generate alternative energy.
<br><br>

New
ways of building motors, new types of materials for building motors
and spacecraft. Motors <I>and
</I>spacecraft.
New ways of storing electricity in capacitors which would be very
handy in making electric automobiles, meaning that you could take all
the energy that normally is sent to the air as heat and braking and
put that energy into a capacitor device which would then bleed off
into a battery and recharge the battery of the car to a certain
extent.
<br><br>

BR:
 Did the technology behind the Aurora come from the Russians?
<br><br>

PP:
 No. That technology was invented specifically right here in the
United States by a scientist that I, in my memory, worked for General
Dynamics for a period of time, and probably worked for Rocketdyne or
General Atomic for a period of time. Remember, General Atomic was
highly disturbed when Lyndon Johnson refused to give them any more
government contracts unless they&rsquo;d move from San Diego to
Texas.
<br><br>

BR:
 Mm-hm. But the Aurora&rsquo;s been moth-balled anyway because that&rsquo;s
old technology, isn&rsquo;t it?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I would assume that. But it was a technology where you spray
gas out through a surface and then explode the gas; mix it with
oxygen and explode it. It&rsquo;s like push-shooting a pumpkin seed.
The pressure, external, would push against it and push it forward at
very high rates of speed. They&rsquo;re very efficient.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay, so... [laugh] That was our 60-second sound byte about the
Aurora, which is worth an interview in itself. But go back to what
you feel that we learned from the Russians, because we had some
fascinating conversations about this.
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, we learned an awful lot about material science. There was a
man by the name of I.
M. Frenchovic [unclear]
that
was a believer in quantum physics. So he wouldn&rsquo;t hire anybody
&ndash; this was in the late &lsquo;50s or mid-50s &ndash; he
wouldn&rsquo;t hire anybody for his institute that didn&rsquo;t
absolutely believe in quantum physics. So a lot of the work they did
was based on quantum physics and we hadn&rsquo;t quite decided
whether that was real or not.

<br><br>

Whether
it was real or not, they came up with a lot of things that were very
interesting. Additionally, they were doing a lot of research work in
such areas as remote viewing and telekinesis and such things.
<br><br>

We
learned a lot. We brought a number of people out from there that
taught us things.

<br><br>

This
was a very interesting thing that happened in the Soviet Union. If
you look at their government, it&rsquo;s kind of a three-branch party
system. You have the people from industry, the people from
government, and the people from the political pedagogy, so that to
get the full vote you had to have someone vote that it wasn&rsquo;t
in violation of Stalinist-Leninist political dogma.

<br><br>

A
lot of science was definitely outside of Stalinist-Leninist political
dogma, therefore the scientists were very frustrated and so there was
a lot of information they were willing to give out because their
government had told them it was baloney anyway so why not give it
away? They wanted to see their ideas and thoughts utilized.

<br><br>

Secondly,
there were a lot of them that, one way or another, snuck out and came
to work for the West and brought a lot of very good information,
including a lot of the very basic things that were happening in what
we&rsquo;ll call <I>psychic
phenomena</I>
or <I>mental
talents.</I>


<br><br>

It
really isn&rsquo;t that. It&rsquo;s actually a definite science and
there&rsquo;s a lot of technology that&rsquo;s behind it. We hear a
lot of stories about that from the government, a lot of past history
that&rsquo;s, much of it, disinformation. We&rsquo;re told that:
<I>Well,
we learned a few things from it but it wasn&rsquo;t particularly
good. </I>I
think that that&rsquo;s very wrong because I know it&rsquo;s
particularly very good and I can&rsquo;t imagine that they&rsquo;re
not using that kind of technology.
<br><br>

Additionally,
we learned a tremendous amount of things about outer space
technology. We learned a lot about the amount of radiation that you
find outside the ionosphere and the problems that that causes. We had
some problems with our early astronauts because we didn&rsquo;t know
what was there.

<br><br>

Notice
there were several lulls in our space program as we found out new
things, and then geared up to take into account the malevolence of
outer space. You know, out of that came a lot of conjecture that
there was way too much radiation for us to have had people in outer
space.

<br><br>

One
of the things that very much interested me was when the Mir Space
Station was crashing. They were worried about the fact that it had a
little radioactive material on it that might cause problems on Earth
and they didn&rsquo;t know exactly where it was going to fall.

<br><br>

But
one of the things the Soviets announced... and one of the things I do
is I listen to short wave, because when you listen to short wave, you
hear about the same event, the same people, the same place, the same
time, and a completely different story of what went on there.
[laughter] So the press in the United States is either completely
ignorant or it&rsquo;s completely controlled, as far as I can tell.

<br><br>

But
one of the things the Soviets did was announce the weight of the Mir
station. When you look at that weight, you find out it was about
5,600 shuttle loads of material. They didn&rsquo;t launch that much,
we didn&rsquo;t launch that much, so why would the Mir weigh as much
as it did?

<br><br>

The
explanation is, which you can find out for yourself if you merely
take a sensitive Geiger counter on a plane flight, is how much
radiation is up there just at 30,000 feet. You&rsquo;re allowed one
or two chest X-rays a year; you get a chest X-ray every two or three
minutes out there, you know, that was a problem. If you look at some
of the symptoms of problems some of the early astronauts had, you&rsquo;d
realize that it probably was radiation poisoning.
<br><br>

BR:
 How did the mass that constituted all that extra shielding...
<br><br>

PP:
 My feeling is that the extra mass that was there on that station was
shielding.
<br><br>

BR:
 How did it get up there?
<br><br>

PP:
 That&rsquo;s an interesting question. I didn&rsquo;t see us launch
anything that could&rsquo;ve taken it there.
<br><br>

BR:
 Did the Russians launch it there?
<br><br>

PP:
 Not that I know of. I mean, you&rsquo;ve seen the...
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. Now, what that implies, then, is that we could never have made
it to the Moon in the way that it had been advertised that we went to
the Moon because everyone would&rsquo;ve been fried. Is that too
simplistic a conclusion?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, that&rsquo;s my conclusion. I mean, I know one thing. You can
go to look at the Moon diorama at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and you
can ask the question: <I>Was
the Lander pressurized with oxygen?</I>
They said: <I>No,
we didn&rsquo;t have a place for it. They had to wear their
spacesuits. </I>And
here&rsquo;s the astronaut standing there with his spacesuit on, and
here&rsquo;s the door to the Lander open, and you can see that that
spacesuit wouldn&rsquo;t fit through that door <I>without
</I>the
astronaut in it.
<br><br>

[laughter]
<br><br>

BR:
 Right.
<br><br>

PP:
 So I did have a bit... You know, there&rsquo;s a bit of speculation
there.
<br><br>

BR:
 What we&rsquo;ve been told by our witness Henry Deacon is that <I>some</I>
of the Apollo missions did actually go to the Moon, but not without
help from our <I>friends</I>,
as it were. Can you make any comment on that, or is this..?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, it&rsquo;s my feeling as a scientist that, if we went to the
Moon, we had to have help from <I>friends.</I>
<br><br>

KC:
 And off-world <I>friends</I>,
you&rsquo;re talking about?
<br><br>

PP:
 I'm talking about...
<br><br>

BR:
 We&rsquo;re talking about <I>friends</I>
in high places. [laughs]
<br><br>

PP:
 ...friends in <I>high
</I>places.
<I>From</I>
high places.
<br><br>

BR:
 But we do have <I>friends</I>
in high places, do we?
<br><br>

PP:
 Far as I know.
<br><br>

BR:
 Do we have any enemies?
<br><br>

PP:
 Far as I know, we do. I mean, there&rsquo;ve been malevolent things
happening all over the world that... You know, you can&rsquo;t deny
cattle mutilation and you can&rsquo;t deny some personal, or human,
mutilation; or, certainly, biomedical manipulation. I mean, it&rsquo;s
happened. Somebody did it, and it could have been done from here. But
when you examine that...

<br><br>

You
know, Linda Moulten Howe has written extensively and spoken
extensively on these things, and examined them extensively. I grew up
with her in the same school system and the same town and know that
she was exceedingly bright, and got brighter and brighter as time
went by. I don&rsquo;t doubt that a lot of her conclusions are
correct conclusions. She&rsquo;s someone that I would absolutely
trust in that.
<br><br>

You
know, I say if something happens in one spot, you don&rsquo;t know.
But when something happens time after time, year after year, in all
different kinds of locations where people don&rsquo;t know each other
and don&rsquo;t communicate with each other and don&rsquo;t read each
other&rsquo;s newspapers and it doesn&rsquo;t make the press, it
seems highly likely that those things happened.
<br><br>

BR:
 I understand. Now, among many other things you are, let me use the
word, an electronics <I>genius</I>,
if I may. Are you in possession of any information about the
constitution of implants that have been recovered from abductees?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I&rsquo;ve talked to people who have removed what they felt
were implants. I deal almost daily with nanoelectronics and
microelectronics, and the descriptions and pictures I&rsquo;ve seen
have nothing to do with any nano- and microelectronics that we have
from anyone that I know of here on this planet.

<br><br>

Many
of them, or most of them, are biological in nature. I know that one
doctor who's removed a number of what they felt were implants, the
implant acted like it was alive and moved through the body away from
the surgeon trying to remove it.
<br><br>

I
knew that some of them, when they were taken out, were minutely
dissected, and I&rsquo;ve seen the pictures of that. They&rsquo;re
devices that signals could be obtained from that were obviously
intelligent signals. They were not random things, they were not
biological things, and yet it was biological material that had
obviously been engineered for a specific purpose.

<br><br>

BR:
 That&rsquo;s <I>really</I>
incredible.
<br><br>

PP:
 I&rsquo;ve never seen anything in writing that would lead me to
believe that we had that kind of technology on this planet.
<br><br>

BR:
 Mm-hm. When we&rsquo;re talking about friends or enemies in high
places, you feel that wasn&rsquo;t a particularly friendly thing to
do?
<br><br>

PP:
 I have no idea. It could well have been. I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt but
what we&rsquo;ve had that from both sides. Friends and enemies.

<br><br>

BR:
 Okay.
<br><br>

PP:
 I think there are people here... There are people that I felt had
crucial knowledge to the perpetration of the planet the way we&rsquo;d
like it to be, and I&rsquo;ve seen them saved from disease,
miraculously. But they had had some incident that they seemed to have
a memory of that we would call maybe an abduction, or maybe a
kidnapping and manipulation.
<br><br>

BR:
 So they&rsquo;re being helped and supported.
<br><br>

PP:
 They&rsquo;re being helped and supported, it appears, from
somewhere.
<br><br>

BR:
 Our experience would support that, all the testimony we&rsquo;ve
received from a lot of people. It&rsquo;s just interesting to hear
your view. This is something we didn&rsquo;t even talk about
yesterday.
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I try to look at everything from a scientific viewpoint; from
a really unbiased, observational point of view. Being as I got
involved in quantum physics early, which is something that deals a
lot with probabilities, I try to figure the probabilities of
things... make observations and feel the probabilities: <I>Well,
what would this mean? </I>

<br><br>

From
a probability standpoint, what&rsquo;s the probability that it just
happened spontaneously? And the probabilities are approaching zero.

<br><br>

What&rsquo;s
the probability that we had something that would do this?
Probabilities are zero or very low.

<br><br>

What&rsquo;s
the probability that it might have come from some outside intelligent
source? The probabilities are up in the, you know, 99 percent region.
[laughs] Then, after you see one after another after another of
these, you begin to think, you know, maybe I&rsquo;m on the right
track here.
<br><br>

BR:
 Yeah. When does it become a reasonable certainty? Yeah, right.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;ve
just mentioned the testimony from our witness and colleague Henry
Deacon and now you&rsquo;ve talked about your experience working with
quantum physics. You told us about... Sorry, let me start this again.


<br><br>

Henry
told us about his research work in what some people call <I>signal
non-locality</I>,
or <I>actional
communication at a distance</I>.
One of the Holy Grails of physics is to build a working device such
that there can be instantaneous communication that can traverse light
years in no time. Is this something which you're able to talk about
at all? Do you have any opinions, experience or..?
<br><br>

PP:
 Well, I&rsquo;ve done a number of experiments and I definitely have
opinions. I can say that Maxwell was right. One of the things I found
out was...
<br><br>

BR:
 This is James...?
<br><br>

PP:
 James Clerk Maxwell, who wrote the first exposition of
electromagnetic theory. From a little bit of his work... the way I
like to describe his work, it&rsquo;s like you took a white sheet of
paper. And he took the end of a paintbrush and dipped it in paint and
made splotches all over this white sheet of paper. He said: <I>Here&rsquo;s
something I saw. Here&rsquo;s something I believe. Here&rsquo;s
something I&rsquo;ve experimented on</I>
and so forth.

<br><br>

So
now you have a white sheet of paper with a lot of splotches, which I
liken to a window that you could peek through just a few holes in the
window, and each time you peek through you see something different.
<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
a lot of the area that was still white, that he hadn&rsquo;t done any
experiments in, but there were a lot of various areas where he
actually did something and had experiments that were repeatable and
were, eventually, describable, if not explainable. So then he took
one large bunch of these and he wrote electromagnetic theory around
that.

<br><br>

Now
that electromagnetic theory allowed us to build motors and
generators, electric motors, electric generators, radio transmitters,
television transmitters, radio and television receivers, computers,
the Internet, etcetera, etcetera, over a period of time. So that was
passed on down through a line of scientists, engineers, physicists
and so forth and became those motors and televisions and so forth.

<br><br>

But
what happened to all the other swatches? Many of them were never,
never... the knowledge was never continued, it was never written
about, etcetera, etcetera. So, early on, I went and replicated most
of the papers, most of the notebooks, most of the letters that went
back and forth, and I started looking at some of these other things.

<br><br>

One
of the things that got out, that people did look at, was a thing
called <I>action
at a distance</I>,
which meant that something happened in point A, and at point B -
which could be clear across the universe &ndash; something could...
information could be sent from point A to point B faster than the
speed of light.

<br><br>

And
it didn&rsquo;t travel; it literally went through some sub-universe
or parallel universe, from A to B, instantaneously and with no energy
required. Just now, in Canada and in Belgium and in France and in
some areas in the United States, there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of
research being done in that.

<br><br>

So,
it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been known at MIT, for example, for
many years; but, MIT knows if they talk about it, they got to back up
and say: <I>All
the physics we&rsquo;re teaching isn&rsquo;t exactly correct. </I>So,
that really hasn&rsquo;t happened, but they want to know that if
Harvard says something that they can say: <I>We&rsquo;ve
known about it for years.</I>
<br><br>

There
was a gentleman that I had met [on] several occasions that ran a kind
of an Anomalous Research Institute that found that these things that
kind of violated the pet laws of physics; they continued to take a
look at them. But they knew that, if that actually worked and was
something that could be repeated, that they better revise their
thinking. For one reason or another -- mostly ego, political or
economic -- a lot of that stuff wasn&rsquo;t brought out.
<br><br>

BR:
 What can you say about whether there were any practically
functioning devices built that were able to utilize this theoretical
principal of communication or action at a distance?
<br><br>

PP:
 Ah, probably nothing.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. I remember that Henry Deacon said that he had actually worked
on these devices. He said that the work had been done at Livermore
prior to Alanaspects
[unclear]
experiments in Paris in the &rsquo;80s.
<br><br>

PP:
 The problem is, when you said practical.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay.
<br><br>

PP:
 Now here&rsquo;s the problem. If you have something that works that
doesn&rsquo;t use electromagnetic radiation, you have to develop a
whole entirely-new technology. Like, how do you tune it?  When you
tune a radio, what you&rsquo;re doing is altering the...
<br><br>

The
problem&rsquo;s with <I>practical</I>.
We may have a practical technology or not. I know that, once I get my
lab built, we&rsquo;re going to have a practical technology, because
I have a lot of work that I&rsquo;ve done and ideas that I&rsquo;ve
done and I now need to build a prototype.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
how to tune something that doesn&rsquo;t have a time function. So how
can you transmit more than one signal at a time? Then, I don&rsquo;t
necessarily want to expose that information because... not that it&rsquo;s
going to be a billion-dollar product, which it would be. I mean,
imagine a cell phone that&rsquo;ll work anywhere in the universe with
no energy, or such little energy that it&rsquo;s inconsequential. Or
Internet that works that way.
<br><br>

BR:
 As Hal Puthoff once said to me &ndash; somebody who I believe you
once knew &ndash; is, he said to me: <I>As
the dog said -- so many trees and so little time.</I>


<br><br>

PP:
 [laughs] Exactly right, exactly right.
<br><br>

BR:
 So, at this point, I&rsquo;m going to thank you very much for the
conversations we&rsquo;ve had both yesterday and today. We&rsquo;re
still on tape. We&rsquo;ve got some time left here today. I&rsquo;m
going to hand over to Kerry with the microphone and camera. David
also wants to ask you some questions about his particular interests
and we want to make sure that we can capture all of this, as we
possibly can do. So, with huge reluctance, I&rsquo;m going to get out
from behind this camera, because I&rsquo;d love to talk to you for
hours more. I hope we&rsquo;re going to get this opportunity later.
And right now I&rsquo;m going to hand over to Kerry.
<br><br>

PP:
 Thank you very much for your interest.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay.
<br><br>

found with flying saucers, if you look at most of the movies there
always seems to be a robot involved with it...
