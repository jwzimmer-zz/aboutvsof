So people understand what that                  is, it would buy about four million homes in the United States.                  Or you could send everybody in the United States $2,623. That                  should give you an idea. Or it would buy 28 million cars at                  the average price, to give you an idea what they&rsquo;re doing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile,                    they&rsquo;re creating it out of thin air. And                  they&rsquo;re getting close to everything when they&rsquo;re                  talking about nationalizing the banks, in other words, making                  the government be the authority on the money. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The truth                    is that&rsquo;s what the Constitution says in the                  first place. Right? It says that the government itself would                  issue money. What we&rsquo;ve done is created this edifice                  called the Federal Reserve System which in turn then, all dollars                  are loaned out at interest, back to the Federal Reserve, the                  private bank system. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now here&rsquo;s the things that are coming up as of you and                  I are speaking, for instance. The market is dropping predictably.                  I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s going to go down to about 3,500                  when they probably quit trading at all because nobody&rsquo;s                  buying stocks right now except for the mutual funds and the                  401Ks. Most of those people have lost between 50 to 70% of                  their asset value. Even Warren Buffet&rsquo;s account is down                  50% from what he had, and people aren&rsquo;t talking about                  that. <br>                <br>                The next thing you have to understand is, the derivative                market has been driving... the derivatives, as I&rsquo;ve been talking                  about for years, are the Achilles heel, basically. Everything&rsquo;s                  gonna collapse on that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, right                    now we&rsquo;ve gone through two years of kind                  of an unwinding of the housing market. Well, today one of the                  Federal Reserve members said that they expect the housing market                  to drop between another 23 to 25%. That&rsquo;s within the                  next year. So that&rsquo;s going to affect a lot of people.                  They&rsquo;re going to be upside down. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, the people who have already gone back in and borrowed                  money from the last stimulus deal, half of those houses are                  in foreclosure again. This is only in a few months.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Oh                wow.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; And this is all public document, to give you an idea.                  Meanwhile, when I was with my banker friends the other day,                  they&rsquo;re very concerned because they have not talked about                  the derivative exposure on the commercial real estate market. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you&rsquo;re going across the country right now, commercial                  properties are being boarded up. Shopping centers are going                  into foreclosure and that&rsquo;s about another... a rough                  number is $400 billion we&rsquo;re going to be looking at in                  the derivative rescue, if you&rsquo;re going to look at it                  just from that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But there&rsquo;s                    about 400 <em>trillion</em> of derivatives                  which are holding up the credit card industry. In other words,                  they pooled together all the money, sold it off to foreign                  investors. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The meeting this week with Hillary over with Japan and Korea                  and China was to try to get them to continue holding the dollar                  as the base currency, and they basically says: <em>Forget it.</em> They&rsquo;re                  not gonna do that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So when                    you&rsquo;re asking me the next question, that is,                  what&rsquo;s gonna happen is that the market&rsquo;s gonna                  keep drifting lower. People that have money in equities, most                  of them are tied up now in their so-called mutual funds, their                  401Ks or their retirement accounts, which have gone down, again,                  like I say, from 50 to 70%. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I mean,                    I talked to a lady in Phoenix yesterday who&rsquo;s                  been putting money in their 401K for the last 30 years and                  it&rsquo;s now worth 30 cents on the dollar what it was a year                  ago. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Are                  you saying that those accounts are gonna go down again?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Yes,                even more. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Oh                wow.&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Let me bring you up to date a little bit, because                  this is... we&rsquo;re all talking about time and we&rsquo;re                  talking right now, you and I, on February 24th and you want                  some dates. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On March                    4th, there&rsquo;s scheduled to be a speech of the                  Treasury Secretary. This is considered a watershed date. There&rsquo;s                  gonna be a kind of a bounce after he gets done speaking. In                  other words, whatever he says, the American people... Whatever                  they&rsquo;re gonna do, the manipulation on the market, he&rsquo;s                  gonna be talking and saying everything is stable but he really                  has nothing left to bring to the party out here &rsquo;cause                  there&rsquo;s nothing here besides debt. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mid-March,                    that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about now.                  March 4th is when they&rsquo;re gonna be speaking. That&rsquo;s                  the Treasury Secretary.

It&rsquo;s like people discuss what&rsquo;s going on                  with stocks -- like U.S. Steel was $190 a year ago, and now                  it&rsquo;s $20 a share.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; [laughs]</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; This                is all in a year.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yes. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Okay, so what I&rsquo;m saying, because people don&rsquo;t                  understand the stock market is nothing more than a gambling                  casino. Once the stock is issued, it&rsquo;s traded between                  brokers, offline, online, everything else, and the prices that                  they put out there are just arbitrary. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s a fixed value. Nor                  does it mean, like, if you do U.S. Steel, for instance, if                  $20 is one share that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to get.                  What&rsquo;s it really worth? It&rsquo;s only worth what people                  are willing to pay. Most people are only buying stocks because                  they think it&rsquo;s gonna turn around and go up. Well, what                  if the industries have all gone to foreign countries? -- which                  they <em>have</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The whole                    stock market is a can of worms and I&rsquo;m telling                  everybody to get out of the stock market yesterday. I&rsquo;ve                  been telling &rsquo;em that for a couple years. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, the                    other thing is, short-term wise, obviously the US Treasury&rsquo;s okay. The only problem we have now, we have                  several new provisions that the government&rsquo;s put out                  under the Patriot Act, as you&rsquo;re probably aware, and                  that&rsquo;s the transfers of money between anybody and any                  parties and anything else. The Patriot Act is making it so                  that they&rsquo;re basically monitoring all transfers of money                  between parties of over $2,500. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Really?                $2,500?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right. They&rsquo;re                  monitoring everything.

The banks are doing                  all kinds of strange things to keep people up, the illusion                  that they&rsquo;re really good. In fact, we had Wells Fargo                  Bank was open on President&rsquo;s Day.

I&rsquo;ve                    got all this money invested in credit cards. </em>And the                    credit cards are now upside down<em>. </em>Right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; We                    just talked about the commercial real estate market, which                    is a huge number.

And this is all coming to rest,                  if you want to look at it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Third                    Option, which is basically what I&rsquo;ve been                  predicting also: The guys have to start a war. And I&rsquo;d                  been saying that they&rsquo;ll probably get the war started                  by the end of the second quarter of this year. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now I&rsquo;m                    giving you some dates.

And that suddenly                  they&rsquo;re no longer doing that? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Oh,                    no.

They&rsquo;re                  basically monetizing it, but there&rsquo;s no interest on it.                  So all we&rsquo;re doing then is causing the dollar... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have two things. We can either go into hyper-inflation                  or deflation. Deflation is happening because all the stores                  right now have big notes that are due. They were due in January. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And these                    notes... because they borrowed money in order to merge, i.e.,                    like K-Mart and Sears merged together. Where&rsquo;d                  they get the money? They got it off of the derivative market,                  which allowed &rsquo;em to have this money. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But all these things are coming up to the plate and say: <em>Hey,                    we want to get paid for the interest. </em>So, all the stores                    across the country right now are having huge sales -- 60,                    70% off. <em>&nbsp;</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Okay.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Now, that gives them the cash to pay the interest                  to &rsquo;em. The only problem is that we&rsquo;re not having                  anything to replace the goods, and these people are deeply                  in debt, and that&rsquo;s where part of the commercial market                  is going to have what I call the upside down, or further collapse                  of our country. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;m                    suggesting everybody make sure you get your food stored up                    if you can right now.

We understand that there might be a lag-time                  between the fact that it went down, I don&rsquo;t know, in                  January, or whatever it was?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Sure.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; And that there&rsquo;ll                    be a lag-time between that indicator and then the actual                    fact that nothing appears in the store because no ships are                  delivering any goods.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Yeah. Here&rsquo;s the problem &ndash; and, again,                  I&rsquo;ve been talking to my bankers. We have all kinds of                  ships with goods right now. These are offshore. They have not                  landed. There&rsquo;s huge ships full of oil, for instance. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, they all ship on Letters of Credit. In other words, the                  people have shipped the goods and say: <em>Okay, it&rsquo;s                  shipped. I want to get paid for it. </em>Banks issue them Letter                  of Credits so when they deliver it... Well, they can&rsquo;t                  even deliver it now because of Homeland Security; or the bank                  that issued the Letter of Credit has gone under. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, none                    of this is good, but I&rsquo;m just telling you                  what the facts are coming down. And they&rsquo;ve been well                  planned.

When push comes to shove, [laughs]                  they&rsquo;re gonna get their guns and defend their territory                  and all this craziness.

What                  they&rsquo;re gonna start doing is saying: <em>Can you have                  the gun?</em> And then the basis of it, if you do defend yourself,                  will you be charged with murder? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other                    thing they don&rsquo;t tell you is where are the                  bullets made?

But the option                  market is so manipulated right now, when they tell you to buy                  all this stuff there isn&rsquo;t anything behind it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got an article here that is talking about                  a &ldquo;summer of rage&rdquo; over the recession in the UK.                  Have you heard about that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Yeah.

When you come down to the true                  unemployment, you check with the State of California, it&rsquo;s                  the people that are drawin&rsquo; unemployment benefits. After                  you&rsquo;ve used up the benefits, you&rsquo;re considered <em>employed</em>.                  How many people who are not getting any benefits at all, that                  are unemployed? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true. A lot of people have turned away                  from the whole unemployment scene because they&rsquo;re trying                  to, you know, make money on their own small businesses, that                  sort of thing. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Well, everybody has to be very creative at this minute                  and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking at.

It wants to bring these people under so they                    come back to the dollar being the best currency. Remember,                    that was agreed a long time ago that the dollar would be                    the one to be used to keep track of all of the oil trades                  throughout the world. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, we&rsquo;ve                    got a lot of countries now that say: <em>No.</em> And                  so what they&rsquo;re trying to do is drive it down, whatever                  they sell at, because people... all these countries now have                  been living on the high, you know, selling oil at over $100                  a barrel. And frankly it has to be up at $80 a barrel in order                  to cover the current expenses for people, throughout the world. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    what you are talking about is - where is the oil? There&rsquo;s                  lots of tankers out there that are sitting out there full of                  oil right now because we&rsquo;re not consuming the oil like                  we did. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All these                    businesses are coming down.

All these things you&rsquo;re talking about are                  all interconnected. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right.                    We heard there was a lot of clothing stores, for example,                  going under, well-known clothing stores. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Everything is going under.

The automobile industry is being                  maintained by what? Washington loaning more money again to                  the automobile [industry].

Like when the big depression happened in 1929,                  then there was sort of a three-year lag during which people                  still more or less had money &rsquo;til about 1933 when everything                  went down to nothing. So, do you think we have a lag? And I                  understand that we&rsquo;re on an escalated timeline, so it&rsquo;s                  not going to be like it was then, but what do you think we&rsquo;ve                  got here? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; I think exactly what you&rsquo;re saying. We&rsquo;re                  gonna go into worse depressions, even worse than &rsquo;29.                  Seriously. I&rsquo;ve been telling other people, if you need                  a new toaster or everything, go over and guy &rsquo;em quick                  because you&rsquo;re not going to get any spare parts.

Look at their                  sales and look what&rsquo;s coming down. Look at the bottom                  lines. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know,                    it doesn&rsquo;t affect most people.

All they                  want to do is get their food and get what&rsquo;s going on                  and most of it&rsquo;s imported. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All these                    other countries now are gonna set up trade barriers and everything                    because they&rsquo;re trying to maintain the                  dollar.

They&rsquo;re                  gonna turn in everybody. They&rsquo;re gonna turn in their                  neighbors because they want to make sure they get their check. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; I also heard that the state governments are, first                  of all, trying to secede even from the Union at this point.                  They&rsquo;re not wanting to go along with the whole situation.                  The other thing is that they&rsquo;re going bankrupt in various                  states, so they&rsquo;re not able to pay their state employees.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.

Those people have to... They&rsquo;re virtually                  unemployed, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Virtually they go to unemployment benefits which                  are not there. Virtually then all your services get shut down,                  and then virtually you get people walking in the streets aimlessly.                  You can just see the picture. They don&rsquo;t know what to                  do because there&rsquo;s nothing out here for them to do.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; And                    do you see a pandemic as kind of the next thing they roll                  out after this economic downturn thing? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Well,                    the economic down thing is gonna have people running around                    on the streets. And so the plan, the Plan 2000 that Jimmy                    Carter put in writing, and again, I put a summery on my website                    as you know, <a href="mailto:nohoax.com">nohoax.com</a>,                  and that calls for a war to get started in the Middle East. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the                    information I&rsquo;m getting is that they&rsquo;re                  getting everything set up to go after Iran, who is basically                  funded by Russia and working with them, and the Chinese. So                  the war that we begin then, the scenario, World War III, which                  is part of their population reduction program.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Well, I know you have to go, George, and I do appreciate                  all your time here.

And, frankly, it&rsquo;s too late. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; What                    about the... I was told that the Native Americans, the tribes,                    are actually trying at this time to create their own currency                  and sort of secede from the Union. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Well...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Do you think they&rsquo;ll                be allowed to do that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Well, it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference because                  there&rsquo;s several places that are doing that. I&rsquo;m                  working with our state senator up here to create our own currency                  for the State of Idaho, using silver as a backing.

But then everybody in the world&rsquo;s going                  to run their money to what? I mean, we&rsquo;re famous for                  what? Potatoes up here. Right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right.                [laughs]</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; But the other problem that&rsquo;s involved in it                  is the weather is changing entirely around the planet, every                  place. Even where we are. I mean, it used to be a banana belt.                  I&rsquo;m looking out and there&rsquo;s five foot of snow out                  here. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Incredible.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t have but six to eight inches of snow                  in the whole month of January and I&rsquo;ve got five feet                  of it sitting on my window. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; [laughs] That&rsquo;s                amazing.

And then I talked                  to my friends in Costa Rica yesterday and the same thing is                  going on. Places in Panama -- Boquete was a good American tourist...                  got wiped out. A mudslide went right through town.

They                  don&rsquo;t know the exact thing on it. They just want to maintain                  control. Well, we&rsquo;ve got everybody controlled in the                  United States by the dollar and by getting food.

The Swiss banks, there&rsquo;s law suits                  going on. And I&rsquo;m... beyond me, I don&rsquo;t have any                  idea how the Swiss authorities allow a court in Florida to                  influence them. What jurisdiction do they really have?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes. The latest news though, George, is that the                  Swiss court actually ruled to prevent UBS from releasing all                  the tax details of its private American clients. But I think                  this is not going to end there. This is going to be quite a                  battle. It&rsquo;s going to go on for quite a long time and                  of course it&rsquo;s going to affect an awful lot of wealthy                  people. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GG:&nbsp; Well, what I&rsquo;m saying is... the same boat.                  You answered the same question. Since you got people up there                  battling now to get control even in Switzerland, what&rsquo;s                  the next step? Get everybody diverted and get the war started. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Okay.
