The scientists                    want to come in. They&rsquo;ve made tests and                  they found they couldn&rsquo;t find any kind of tool marks                  or anything on the whole Skull. But there were some around                  the jaw and the teeth. But when Dorland cracked the tooth when                  it was at Hewlett-Packard, he did restoration on it to repair                  it. So it&rsquo;s hard to say where the markings came from.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But                  the thing is... Even so, the thing that blows the                  scientists&rsquo; minds is...the fact is they can&rsquo;t                  figure out how the Skull was separated. And being separated,                  and with Hewlett-Packard&rsquo;s tests, the top half of the                  Skull and the jaw are the same piece of crystal. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="crystal_skull_lg.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="crystal_skull_sm.jpg" width="300" height="225" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="right"></a>KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; And that right there...how they can separate                  the two...the technology, even today, would be pretty                  much impossible. And the fact, is how they put prisms inside                  the Skull, how they put the lenses in there that work to the                  eye sockets. That would take zero gravity to try to do it today.                  And really I don&rsquo;t think we could really duplicate it                  in zero gravity.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So                  who did it, how they did it, that&rsquo;s what makes the                  Skull so interesting. But the real thing about the Skull, what                  it is, is what you <em>feel</em> about it, you know. People                  pick up this energy, this specialness.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Well crystals in general will give you energy.

Yeah. Yeah. It&rsquo;s... Especially                  my life now is just like a fast-moving river. Things happen.                  It&rsquo;s like...

Come back. Somebody from England comes                    over and stays with me. Somebody from Italy comes and stays                    with me. One of them, maybe the person from Italy, wanted                    to stay right to the last time, the last day, and then I                    took off and went to Sedona and Scottsdale and did lectures.                  Get back and then I do another.

And also it pulls me and puts me in positions.                  Like, I&rsquo;m down here. I don&rsquo;t know exactly why.                  But, you know, I&rsquo;m running into these people that have                  the need to be here, the need. I&rsquo;m finding the country                  to be an amazing place. And I think there&rsquo;s some really                  special energy spots.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And                  the Skull, one of the jobs it does, it works on the heart chakra,                  opening peoples&rsquo; hearts to this universal love. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what                    it also does is, it works on the ley lines of the Earth.                    And it helps to balance out the energy. And what&rsquo;s                  so important with the shift that&rsquo;s coming in 2012... It&rsquo;s                  like, if the Earth is out of balance at all when all this energy                  hits it, it&rsquo;s gonna... You know, it&rsquo;ll just                  fly anywhere, you know. We really wouldn&rsquo;t want to see                  what could happen. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But if                    we can work with people on these grid lines and open up the                    energy and make it in balance, then the energy hitting it                    could make it a lot less. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons                  I do this.<br>                  <a href="kerry_crystal_skull_lg.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="kerry_crystal_skull_sm.jpg" width="300" height="169" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="left"></a><br>                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Have                  you been to Stonehenge and to Egypt, to the Pyramids?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; I                    have to go to Egypt to the Pyramids.

I think it&rsquo;s Spain, Thebes, or wherever, that                  area is supposed to be special area. It has some kind of energy                  I need to go to. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; But I find that where I&rsquo;m                    supposed to go, people call and say: <em>Hey, we&rsquo;d                    like to do a lecture here</em>. It seems to be the right                    place.

In 2007... But, what happened is, I met                  her. There&rsquo;s a lot of things in Anna&rsquo;s life and                  Mitchell-Hedges&rsquo; life that had paralleled things that                  happened to me. I was in Panama, a lot of the places they were                  at. And I had an open connection right away to the Skull when                  I saw pictures of it. In &lsquo;81 I heard about it, where                  it was at, and I went up to see her and met with her and we                  became really good friends.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And she                    allowed me to go with her when she did different lectures                  and stuff all over the world. And so I was able to take her                  around the world to all these different sites, spiritual sites,                  around the world. And so that was... We became really                  good friends. And she&rsquo;s an amazing, amazing person, someone                  I have total respect for. She&rsquo;s a really neat person.<br>                  <img src="anna_mitchell_hedges.jpg" width="331" height="480" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br>                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; So                is she still alive?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; No. What happened is, she traveled with... You                  know, she moved from place to place a lot, so she moved from                  Canada to England, England back to Canada. These were full                  moves, with new houses and everything.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; And then she came back in early 2000. And she was                  in Canada, and she was very sick. And I talked to her on the                  phone and I said... There was no one really around her                  at the time. So I said: <em>Come to Indiana and I&rsquo;ll                  take care of you</em>. And she decided to do that. And she                  came down there. And she spent the last 8 years of her life                  with me, and I took care of her. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And she taught me what she wanted to be done with the Skull,                  how it was supposed to be handled, and what she believed in. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    I gave my word. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing                  right now, is carrying out my word. My word was that I would                  take the Skull up and make it available to people that felt                  the importance of it, OK? People that felt... Not everybody                  is drawn to the Skull, but some people are really drawn to                  the Skull and they come from all over. So by opening it up                  to those people, that&rsquo;s part of what I...my promise...that                  I promised to her. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK. And what is... like,                  was there a religious significance for Anna and the Skull?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; And the Skull? Well you know what, Anna and myself... You                  know, I&rsquo;m a very spiritual person. I feel the connection                  to god very closely and very importantly. I&rsquo;m not at                  this point in my life a &ldquo;religious&rdquo; person in the                  fact that I don&rsquo;t believe in the dogma of religion, but                  I work on the spirituality. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I&rsquo;m working on... I believe that the true essence                  of religion is inside, in the person, and going into that person                  and finding that connection is what I feel it&rsquo;s all about.                  And the Skull is a tool for mankind. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Mayas                    believed it was a god. To them it was like their god had                    returned. But what it really is, it&rsquo;s a tool                  to open the heart to the universal love. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I feel                    a connection with the Skull and I feel, spiritually, if I                    can help people, if I can help the world, and use the tool                    to do it, that&rsquo;s what I feel is a very important                  job.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Did                    Anna believe in the spiritual side, or did she believe in                  more of the religious side?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; Anna                was a very spiritual person.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; As a matter of fact, you know, we had friends... We                  had this one friend, she was a secretary for Mother Theresa                  and worked with Mother Theresa for a while. And she met Anna.                  She said Anna had the same vibration as Mother Theresa. And                  that&rsquo;s how she was. She was a person that if you met                  her, it&rsquo;s like you knew her all your life. And she made                  you feel that way. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; But she also... You know, she was very connected                  to the other side, so connected it was just like... In                  the last part of her life, there was so much psychic and different                  forces around her, it was just like unbelievable. It was like                  the veil between the other side and her was just so close,                  it was just like it was popping through. It was pretty amazing.                  So she was a very spiritual person. And very special.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; So                    did she ever talk about any beings that were associated with                  the Skull?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; Yes. Yeah. She felt... Well, there is different                  beings that have connection with the Skull and they are the                  ones that work through it. The Mayans are very connected to                  the Skull. The Mayans of Lubaatun, that area, they&rsquo;re                  not... They&rsquo;re a Mayan group that&rsquo;s different                  than the average Mayan and they have connections with the ETs                  and they have connections with the Skulls. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="crystal_skull_close_up_lg.jpg" target="_blank"></a></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="crystal_skull_close_up_lg.jpg" target="_blank"></a>KC:&nbsp; OK.                Do you know which ETs?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BH:&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see.

And when you took the picture,                  the Skull turned blue, the table cloths turned blue and the                  walls turned blue.
