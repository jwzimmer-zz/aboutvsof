And they were being brought forward                    one at a time, and then our consciousness would be uploaded                    for all of those beings to actually see all our life experiences                    and the information on the world and so on. And you see all                    these images.

So the next morning I went                  to my office to do a pregnancy test, and of course she was                  pregnant. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And like                    six weeks later we&rsquo;re sitting in the ultrasound                  room. During medical school I had worked with Dr. McMillan                  and I actually did some of the background research on ultrasound                  before any of the doctors in North America actually had it                  for analysis, so I could read ultrasounds. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I&rsquo;m sitting in the ultrasound room and the tech&rsquo;s                  moving over my wife&rsquo;s abdomen. And as she scans over                  the abdomen, the technician, you could tell... Her lips                  dried right up, and she had this kind of stark look on her                  face. And I knew right away. I could see nuchal thickening                  and the center of my daughter&rsquo;s heart was stopped. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Wow.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Is                this the young girl we just met?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right. Now you&rsquo;ve got to understand that some                  of the things that&rsquo;ve happened to me are so remarkable                  that they just, you know... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She was                    born through C-section. I was told supernaturally, I had                    visitations that told me that she wasn&rsquo;t going                  to die, even though the surgeons said: <em>We don&rsquo;t know                  why she&rsquo;s even born alive.</em> Because her heart was... Literally                  the center of her heart was gone. She had almost a single chamber                  heart. Right? Which is a miracle. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they                    did the first surgery at six and a half months. By the way,                    we&rsquo;re pro-life. We knew that she was going to                  be born with Downs Syndrome, and of course we hoped that it                  was going to be somehow miraculously healed.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I was                    told, basically, don&rsquo;t be fearful, that she&rsquo;s                  going to survive, and she&rsquo;s going to have this surgery.                  She had her first surgery. She had already lost four ounces                  from her birth weight by the time she had her first surgery. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then at two and a half years, her heart started to enlarge                  again. It was now the size of an adult heart and she was about                  to die. So we had oxygen tanks, you know, oxygen pumps concentrating                  oxygenated air and it had a 60-foot long tube going to her                  bedroom with a little mask before her surgery. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    I had a... because I have visitations all                  the time. They told me: <em>This is the words the surgeon will                  say to you, that I don&rsquo;t know what I did, but I put in                  only four sutures, and her heart was miraculously healed. </em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There&rsquo;s not even just a grade-one mitral valve defect.                  They didn&rsquo;t have to replace the heart valves. But literally,                  with the Dacron grafts that he had done earlier, and with just                  a few sutures, she&rsquo;s healed. She never even had to be                  on a heart drug, never been in a hospital, hasn&rsquo;t even                  ever had a cold, which is amazing for Downs Syndrome. Right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the                    key issue to me... And I think that I was permitted                  to go through these experiences - this is one of the many ones                  - is to understand the issue of the sacredness of <em>all</em> human                  life, whether it&rsquo;s the disabled, the elderly, people                  of different faiths, skin colors, intellectual powers, whatever,                  that we&rsquo;re all in a sense the continuous incarnation                  of the Creator God, which is the message of The Kingdom that                  Yeshua Jesus was trying to give. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other                    experience I want to share is back in... October                  10th of 1993, I was face-down praying and I was brought supernaturally                  by, if you want to call it, the term, <em>archangel</em>, which                  is one of the senior messengers. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was brought by this archangel, and he announced his name.                  He said he name was Gabriel. Right? And the word <em>Gabriel</em> means                  one who has a message from the voice of the Most High God. <em>Gabriel</em> means                  one who can speak for God. Right? That&rsquo;s what it means. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he                    brought me to an underground facility. He brought me to some                    satellite facility. And we didn&rsquo;t just walk around                  and he kind of said: <em>This is that, and this is what&rsquo;s                  been happening.</em> He actually explained the technology to                  me in great detail. We spent, if you want to call it in the                  spirit realm, I spent hours and hours and hours with him. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I said: <em>Well, where am I?</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he                    wouldn&rsquo;t tell me. He said: <em>You&rsquo;re gonna                    know because you&rsquo;re gonna go to the place where this                    pastor is.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I thought it was Dallas. Right? So I called up. <em>No,                    no he&rsquo;s already left here. He&rsquo;s gone to Colorado                    Springs.</em> It was a pastor by the name of Pastor Doug                    Sheets. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So my wife called, and she checked with a placement agency.                  She said: <em>Well, there&rsquo;s no jobs available in Colorado                  Springs.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So three weeks later, she got prompted to go and start calling                  around. And the second hospital she called, she talked to a                  lady by the name of Joyce Wolf, who is the head of CCom. <em>Oh,                  we need an Op-Med doctor. Your husband does occupational                  and environmental medicine? He has a background in...?</em> And,                  you know, I was a charter member of Greenpeace, and had a background                  in toxicology and chemistry and biochemistry. <em>Oh good,                  we&rsquo;ll fly you up this weekend.</em> And four days later                  I had the job. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Hm.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; July                    10th of the next summer, which was July 10th of 1994, I walked                    through the same facilities underground and the same satellite-based                    engineering stations and classified projects as I had with                  the angel.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; OK?

That&rsquo;s not even Fed-Ex                  Couriers.

Are you saying that they&rsquo;re                    <em>not</em> going to step in forever, or there&rsquo;s certain things                  they <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; No, they can step in only if there&rsquo;s a transformation                  of the heart. You see, it&rsquo;s not going to be space-based                  technology to knock out, you know, to shield the Earth from                  the collapse of the magnetosphere. It&rsquo;s not going to                  be space-based particle weapons that can hit an incoming meteor.                  Or a solar storm. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s going to be a change in the heart of mankind that                  we will not harm any other race. We&rsquo;ll not invade a country,                  like what we&rsquo;ve done in Iraq and kill 1.5 million Iraqis.                  We will not put poison in vaccines and call it fine. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will not go to third-world countries like Poland two months                  ago and do tests on Polish vagrants and kill them. There were                  300 tests and 23 died within minutes, and 200 more were very                  seriously sickened. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they&rsquo;ve                    now imported to America 500 million doses of the Sanofi Pasteur                  Vaccine made on contract for Homeland Security. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now it&rsquo;s not to scare people. It&rsquo;s                    to make them understand that the reality that I try to present                    on the show is both the technical, scientific, <em>public</em> information,                  you know, in the public domain, as well as classified. But                  you&rsquo;ll see an overall picture.

So all five                  Special-Op agents, I had to examine &rsquo;em. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the five broke down and told me in great detail how                  they removed two unexploded fourth-generation U.S. Army Corp                  Engineer micro-nukes, thermate, RDX, and high explosive cores,                  and the buildings were brought down by the FBI and ATF. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I kept that information hidden. And as I was driving down                  the street in Littleton, Colorado -- because I had my practice                  in downtown Denver, and I was living in Littleton and down                  on the Highlands Ranch. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; And                this was after... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; This was after. This was back in 2003. I&rsquo;m                  driving down the road, and because I do have this gift, literally                  I hear the voice of God, just like Moses. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; You know, what it talks about in the Bible? I&rsquo;m                  the bloodline descendent. OK? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God said: <em>Turn on the radio.</em> And I turn it on.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he said: <em>Turn to this channel.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I do,                    and I&rsquo;m hearing this guy talk about financial                  things. I say: <em>Oh, that&rsquo;s boring. Why am I listening                  to this?</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then                    all of a sudden... <em>Don&rsquo;t turn                    it off. </em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then                    a guy comes on and it&rsquo;s Alex Jones. And Alex                  comes on and he starts talking about this New World Order stuff,                  and I got this real kind of <em>pinge</em> in my spirit because                  I&rsquo;d kept this information hidden since &rsquo;95 to 2003.                  I said: <em>I&rsquo;m going to release this information.</em> So                  I called into the show a couple of times and I told them I                  have information about Oklahoma City. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the guy who asked me to do a really extensive interview                  was a Pastor Butch Paugh on Genesis Network. Well, after that,                  the network called me back and said: <em>We want you to do                  the show.</em> So in February of 2004 I started doing a radio                  show on Genesis. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, before that, I had done a kind of, like an entertainment                  show, called <em>Laughter is the Best Medicine</em> on Clear                  Channel. So I&rsquo;d go there on Wednesday nights with Mark                  Alan Curry. We used to have a fun time going down to the Clear                  Channel studios in Denver and just crack jokes back and forth                  and talk about wellness and toxicology and environmental medicine,                  and anti-aging and things like that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, since                    that time... You really need to understand... I&rsquo;ve                  been in so many places... at the wrong place at the wrong                  time. [laughs] </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was the doctor for the Englewood Fire Department and the                  ladder truck that was actually there on the scene, including                  a number of the other people there, so I know exactly what                  happened. It was a complete government op at Columbine. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was the doctor for the first kid shot in Columbine. And                  I had one pediatric patient, and he had only started working                  there, going to school, because he had a special-ed need --                  Mark Taylor -- three weeks before. Right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And when                    he came out of hospital after two 14-hour procedures and                    57 units of blood, his mother asked me to put my hands on                    him and pray for him. And I have an intuitive gift of discernment                  that&rsquo;s very unique. So I put my hands on him. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I knew right away. I said: <em>You                      have an abscess in your chest that they missed, and I&rsquo;m going to put you                    on a specific antibiotic and in three days to the hour you&rsquo;re                    going to call me in pain and I&rsquo;m going to put you in                    hospital and drain it.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And to the hour he called me. OK?I put him in the hospital                  and I told the radiologist, I said: <em>Now, when you go and                  do the CT scan, put this catheter into the abscess.</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said: <em>Well how do you know that?</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said: <em>Well,                      when you do the CT you&rsquo;re going to                    see the abscess. Put the catheter in, drain it, and call                    a thoracic surgeon. OK? </em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So he did and he said: <em>How did you know that?</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I said: <em>It&rsquo;s                      a long story. OK?</em> <em>So don&rsquo;t                    get</em>... [Bill laughs]</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Three weeks                    later he&rsquo;s walking around with a PCA pump                  getting fentanyl. So he can press the pump every so many minutes                  and the pump will then remember so he can&rsquo;t press it                  too many times, and he gets a little burst of fentanyl. And                  he&rsquo;s in agony. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    abscess is about the size of a fist, and the thoracic surgeon&rsquo;s                    itching. He says: <em>OK, well, we&rsquo;re                  going to have to cut this out, because if we don&rsquo;t the                  abscess will expand or it&rsquo;ll go septic and he&rsquo;ll                  die.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I told                    Mark. He&rsquo;s sixteen-and-a-half; he&rsquo;s not really                  bright; his mother is kind of emotionally a basket case, and                  he said: <em>Well. I want</em>... They were, you know,                  they were &ldquo;believers<em>,&rdquo;</em> you know, Christians.                  They don&rsquo;t believe in miracles. They don&rsquo;t believe                  that we have the authority to take authority over reality,                  whether it&rsquo;s our physical bodies or whatever. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I said: <em>Look                      Mark, I&rsquo;m going to pray for you. </em>I                  said:<em> And tomorrow morning instead of you going in for                  surgery, you&rsquo;re going to walk out of here.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And at first he looked at me like: <em>Whoa,                      that&rsquo;s                    a pretty bold thing to say. </em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I stayed                    up all night and I prayed for him. Next morning I came in                    about 7.15 and I just put my hand on him and said: <em>God,                  you saved this kid from seven bullets to the chest. </em>Right? <em>And                  one to the arm and leg.</em> And the bullets actually went                  behind his heart and in front of the aorta. One hit the T-9                  vertebra and knocked a fragment off.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    is the way I talked to God, I said: <em>You&rsquo;re                    going to heal him immediately and you&rsquo;re going to transform                    his body so he&rsquo;ll be a witness, because if you didn&rsquo;t                    allow him to survive this without being able to tell the                    truth of what happened in Columbine.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I put                    my hand on him. It was like holding a high-tension power                    line. All of a sudden it just felt like this energy [makes                  sizzling noise] coming right through me. And I could see literally                  with the mind&rsquo;s eye, if you want to call it, The Creator.                  I could see right down to his cells, and everything, and it                  was gone. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said: <em>Mark,                      get your clothes ready. We&rsquo;re walking                    out of here.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Wow!                Yeah.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And                    I walked up to the front desk to the nurse and I said: <em>He&rsquo;s not going to surgery for a 7-hour procedure                  to cut out four ribs and take out this abscess. He&rsquo;s                  coming home.</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She looked at me like: <em>Oh-oh,                      this guy&rsquo;s a nut case.                    How can we get psychiatry down here?</em> Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said: <em>No.                      Repeat the CT scan. It&rsquo;s gone. </em>So                  they repeated the CT scan and an hour-and-a-half later, he                  was hopping and skipping out of the hospital. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Fabulous.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Now isn&rsquo;t                    info about this on the web, about this boy and his mother                  in regard to you?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Oh, what happened is they get involved with... The                  mother has a problem; she&rsquo;s a manic depressive. And they                  offered all kinds of big movie scripts and money and everything                  and Mark actually... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Right now                    I just got a contact from her doctor just last week because                    I&rsquo;m trying to help the doctor. He called me all                  the way from Iowa, saying: <em>Please, you&rsquo;re one of                  the few people that care for Mark.</em> And I still do, and                  I care for his mom, too. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But they said a lot of nasty things because they got involved                  with some pastors, and they got a big possibility of a movie                  contract. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what                    was happening is I was working and my wife was working on                    collecting a ton of information, because we were going to                  private showings of videotape that the public didn&rsquo;t                  see. I got a chance to interview and talk to almost every other                  child that survived the Columbine shooting. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So there were many of the kids that actually died of SWAT                  Team bullets. There were at least, probably, we think up to                  4 kids that may have died from SWAT Team bullets, from the                  forensics. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Mark                    literally stayed and lived with us for almost a year-and-a-half.                  He went to vacation with us, even to Las Vegas. Right? Even                  when they asked me to go up in January of 2000 to speak at                  the Full Gospel Fellowship, I paid my own ticket. We didn&rsquo;t                  ask for anything. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what                    happened is, the mother had been contacted by a big movie                    company, wanting to turn this into a Columbine movie, and                    they got real angry that we wouldn&rsquo;t just hand everything                  over or do things their way. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said: <em>No,                      no, we&rsquo;re not going to turn this into                    a sideshow here. This is real serious; we had this kid survive;                    we had this miraculous thing happen; we don&rsquo;t                    want this to turn into a sideshow</em>. And that&rsquo;s                    where the negativity started.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yeah.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s really unfortunate that happened,                  because Mark is still, you know, he&rsquo;s very sick right                  now. He&rsquo;s been in and out of a psychiatric facility.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Mm.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; His                  doctor, one of his doctors, in Iowa contacted me: <em>What can we do to try to help him?</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said: <em>Well, you know he needs serious help. </em>But                  a lot of the time they give these young people drugs that I                  think are patently toxic.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; We know for example, when you give somebody that&rsquo;s                  manic depressive, SSRI drugs like Luvoc, Prozac, etc., they                  go over the deep end. Unfortunately, his doctors gave him the                  wrong drugs.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; OK?                    These drugs came out of Hoffmann-LaRoche. They came out of                    mind control projects in the Soviet Union and Germany going                    right back to I.G. Farben. They get right back to G proteins.                  And he had a real bad reaction from whatever they gave him.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes.

But backed up from that you&rsquo;ve been                  in the right place at the right time for a reason here and                  that is to give what you would probably call your testimony.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m a witness.

And                  one of the projects was to work on a Ph.D. neurology residency                  under Dr. Wallace Tourtellotte. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the other four projects were all classified. Four of them                  were actually cybernetic projects. One was actually a helmet                  that would convert thoughts directly to on-flight commands                  directly to a supercomputer that they already had with command,                  or symbols, that would be projected onto the canopy of the                  jet so you could fly the jet by thoughts, fire off ordnances. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the other three projects were to take prisoners from West                  Orange and Irvine State Penitentiaries and wet-wire their brains                  with platinum and palladium micro-wires. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Dr.                    Tourtellotte had a custom-made CT implanter that was used                    with a CT scan that could implant micro-wires in specific                  nuclei in the brain to actually use supercomputers -- that                  were classified -- to convert neural-net stochastic firing                  sequences so they&rsquo;d get particular images. So you could                  control their behavior, see what they see, hear what they hear. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I turned it down. I said: <em>No. You people are crazy!</em></font> </p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK,                  to turn them into Manchurian Candidates.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah, they actually had a thing called the &ldquo;Rambo-chip,&rdquo; that                  they had back in the &rsquo;60s and this is part of Delgado&rsquo;s                  research at Yale. They had a thing called the Rambo-chip and                  what the Rambo-chip was, was a rage-control chip that was in                  the subthalamic nucleus that could actually control rage. You                  flip the switch and they would kill, and you would turn it                  off and they&rsquo;d stop. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So this was one of the things the residents would laugh at: <em>Ha,                    ha, ha. We can do this stuff.</em> But I think that&rsquo;s                    pretty ghoulish. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And people                    don&rsquo;t understand that a lot of the people                  that they give these projects have 180-plus IQs, but they&rsquo;re                  twisted. OK? Or if they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re compromised.                  And if they eventually discover it and they try to pull back,                  they do things like &ldquo;patch&rdquo; them. You ever heard                  of what a patch is? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m                not sure.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; OK. A patch is where they give you an intravenous                  patch. The patch lasts three days. OK? Or a transdermal patch.                  And if you don&rsquo;t get the next patch in three days you                  die a horrific death.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Mm                hm.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; OK?

Now, some of this is on record on the Granada Forum Lecture                    and a lot of people watching this will already be familiar                  with that material.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re                    nearly two years further on from there. Where are we now?                    What does this mean for the human race and for the individuals                  watching this now? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well                    the timeline to watch for is actually the nation of Israel.                  OK? And the timeline to watch is... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s why my calling is particularly important,                  because I&rsquo;m going to re-release my book, <em>Clay and                  Iron,</em> here sometime in the not too distant future. Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah. So if you look at the nation of Israel, there&rsquo;s                  so much contradiction. All the stuff with Iran is all over                  Israel. OK?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Even American foreign policy. The reason why they                  went into Iraq was Israel. A trillion dollars spent, the collapse                  of the economy -- it&rsquo;s all tied back to Israel. OK?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And people say: <em>Well,</em> <em>why                      is Israel so important? Why was there a first holocaust?                    Why is there planning to be a second?&rdquo;</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it&rsquo;s                    really pretty simple. Think of it this way: If the Creator                    of the universe made a people, or a group of people, you                    could call it a mixed group of people, the ancient tribes                    of Israel, as an object-lesson to the world, a scapegoat                    in a sense, a way of explaining to people: <em>If you try to                  follow The Law you get condemned and destroyed</em>. OK? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what                    would happen is that... The original books of                  the Bible spoke about a God you could not see that was the                  Creator that created you in his image. OK? And, even if they                  didn&rsquo;t understand it, they tried to adhere to it. They                  kept every jot and tittle. Right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    the &ldquo;People of the Book,&rdquo; which is what                  they used to be called -- they weren&rsquo;t called the Jews                  or the Israelites -- they had to be wiped out because they                  would tell people. Even if they went off and they went through                  a reformation or they learned from other religious groups,                  whether it&rsquo;s Buddhists, or Hopi, or natives, they&rsquo;d                  eventually start getting <em>beyond</em> religion. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I said                    in <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2221852945040630461" target="_blank">my talk on The                    Granada Forum</a>, 10,000 years from                    now will there be anything called &ldquo;religion&rdquo;?                  Of course not. It won&rsquo;t exist because we&rsquo;ll have                  a full knowledge of the Creator Gods and what they are. Because                  we can&rsquo;t exist and transcend beyond the technology unless                  we do that. We won&rsquo;t survive. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Right,                    but people...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; In                other words, the two are mutually exclusive. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; But                to get back to what the role is of Israel. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; The role of Israel is a timepiece. It&rsquo;s actually                  a detonator. It&rsquo;s a transformative event. It&rsquo;s                  like the ultimate, if you want to call it, death trap for civilization. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what&rsquo;s happened? For example, I&rsquo;ve had on my                  show numerous times, Barry Chamish. A good example is, the                  nation of Israel arose, and the holocaust... The greatest                  lies in modern history have been about the holocaust. Yes,                  they killed almost 7 million Jews. Yes they killed probably,                  of others, up to maybe 23 million. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the real goal was not only a ritual sacrifice to the transdimensional                  demonic realm. Right? But the real goal transcends that. It                  was to wipe out the <em>idea</em> of a Creator God and that                  we&rsquo;re an incarnation of the Creator. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because                    eventually if the reformation and all these other things                    were to continue to proceed... Since the breakup                  of the control of the Roman Catholic Church, and all the spinoffs                  and everybody trying to get into the New Age, and all the other                  religious things, where there&rsquo;s a return to spirituality... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The big                    move right now is not toward religion, it&rsquo;s                  toward spirituality, whether they&rsquo;re coming from a Christian                  viewpoint, a Jewish viewpoint, a Buddhist viewpoint. And they&rsquo;re                  all starting to kind of compare notes and realize that, even                  though they use different terms, they&rsquo;re starting to                  understand there&rsquo;s a commonality there.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Sure.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yep.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; But                  still, to steer you back. So the role of Israel at this time...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well,                    the role of Israel is primarily to act on the, if you want                    to call it, on the Luciferian serpentine side, is to act                  as a detonator for the final annihilation of mankind.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; So,                in practical terms...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; They                use it as a final focal point.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; You mean they&rsquo;re                  going to attack Iran, and in return... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Yeah, or the threat of an attack will set in motion                  the peace treaty that&rsquo;ll partition the State of Israel.                  Just think of it this way.Logically, if you&rsquo;re from another                  world and you were to see a nation that&rsquo;s the size of,                  you know, a little tiny strip of land anywhere from 10 to 16                  miles long -- the third nuclear power... Probably the most                  advanced in terms of biological weapons on the planet is the                  State of Israel.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; They&rsquo;re                number one.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; They have their own space-based imaging systems,                  ImageSat. They&rsquo;ve got all kinds of weapons, when they                  were kind of on the outs, that they developed with the South                  Africans. They even, a lot of the time, buy their own jets                  and just stack &rsquo;em right up. They have the number one                  air force on the planet in terms of rapid response, and killing                  capacity. Number one, not number two or three. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What happens                    is, you divide that nation and they have no boundary zone                    where they can protect themselves. And the only thing they                    can do is to pull a &ldquo;Samson Option&rdquo; and hit                  a button. They have space-base platforms. Because Israel has                  them. Israel has space-based weapons platforms, imaging systems,                  terrible stuff. They could wipe out every city within 10,000                  miles of them.

It&rsquo;s all being                  set up because, you see, the leaders of Israel are Satanic                  Luciferian. The entire State of Israel was set up, as Barry                  Chamish has said, so they could cleanse themselves of any who                  is a &ldquo;Torah Jew,&rdquo; anyone who understands the nature                  of the Creator God. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even if                    they didn&rsquo;t understand the depths of it, they                  didn&rsquo;t want anybody to understand that they were created                  in the image of a God and they&rsquo;re a spirit having a physical                  existence on this plane of existence. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They wanted to then replace them with a Luciferic idea, an                  agnostic idea, a communist idea. So the State of Israel was                  originally sponsored with the Soviet, the actual Communist                  Soviet. OK?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Mm                hm.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; And                    the idea was to create an agnostic Luciferian society where                    they follow the highest tenants of Babylonian Kabbalah, which                  means that they themselves are Gods.

Actually from the oil field, it mainly hit along                  that fault line when the Earth shifted back at the time of                  Abraham.

I was actually                    asked to go over to Israel and say a prayer at the southwest                    end of the Dead Sea, at the bottom of Masada, which I did                  on Rosh Hashanah right at sundown, and blow the <em>shofar,</em> and actually say this Hebrew prayer. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I did that.

I don&rsquo;t                    even know anybody there. There&rsquo;s not even any jobs                    there or anything that I want to do there. </em>Right? And                    he started laughing at me. Right? And cracking jokes, because... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People                    need to know that they&rsquo;re watching us and they                  know the future that we don&rsquo;t know. Right? And a lot                  of times we probably wouldn&rsquo;t do things we have to do,                  because some of the stuff we have to do is pretty painful and                  messy.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; So what&rsquo;s                going down that brings you here?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well,                  part of it is being here now so you could even do this taping. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; OK.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Because there&rsquo;s people here that have to wake                  up. They&rsquo;re going to have to hear this message to know                  that I&rsquo;m called, what&rsquo;s actually called, &ldquo;The                  Sons and Daughters of the Most High God.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m one                  called &ldquo;The Witnesses.&rdquo; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, I&rsquo;m going to back this up a bit so you&rsquo;ll                  get an understanding of just how important this meeting is                  tonight. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the                    first century, my family were in this 24-family cycle of                    the Cohanim (also spelled Kohanim) that actually served in                    the temple at the time of Yeshua. And a prophecy was given                  directly by Emmanuel, directly to my ancestor, that was written                  down in the first century and passed on all the way through                  to my Great-uncle Michael, who died in the &rsquo;70s. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That was                    supposed to be given to me ,because I was the eldest of the                    eldest. His brother thought he was the one called to give                    this word, which is to blow the trumpet of Elijah and actually                    tell people about the coming of the new age, the new world                    that was going to come, a world of peace, where there wouldn&rsquo;t                  be lack or all these things. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that was passed down for almost 19 centuries. Right? That                  person is me. OK? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the                    reason why I know that is because at [age] eight and a half                    when I had my tonsil surgery done... I had a French surgeon                    who was operating on me in Colchester County Hospital. They                    cut an artery in my neck and I bled to death. OK? There&rsquo;s                  a little guillotine-style thing, and they pull the tonsils                  through with tongs, cut it off. And I had an aberrant artery                  and I bled to death. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I went                    down the tunnel of light. And of course, the way it happened                    is, all of a sudden I&rsquo;m floating over the                  operating room table, I&rsquo;m looking down, I can see this                  little boy, and I see blood spurting everywhere. I say: <em>Gee,                  that looks like me</em>. I didn&rsquo;t feel any pain. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And all                    of a sudden I&rsquo;m standing there and I&rsquo;m                  walking around, trying to talk to the nurses and doctors and                  nobody would pay attention to me. So I&rsquo;m getting very                  frustrated. So I walk toward the door and I just went right                  through it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I turned right and I walked down the hall, and I saw the                  nursery, and I saw these babies all bound up tight on their                  side, and the nurses were trying to keep them, you know, because                  if one starts, they all start to cry. And they all had little                  different colored blankets on them. So one baby started to                  cry and they all started to cry. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And all of a sudden everything started to fade into an inky                  black, a black so black you could feel it, and I felt like                  I was being squenched through a pinhole. Right? And then all                  of a sudden I cried out, you know: <em>God, where am I? Something                  terrible&rsquo;s happening.</em> Right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I saw                    a pinpoint of light and all of a sudden there was these intersecting                    crimson lines, and I&rsquo;m going down                  this tunnel, and I say: <em>It&rsquo;s too fast, God! It&rsquo;s                  too fast.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then                    all of a sudden I&rsquo;m in this place of light,                  and across in the other side of this space there&rsquo;s a                  man standing there, you know, almost glowing light. And he                  had a broad golden sash with a double-corded belt, and what                  I call brass-like sandals. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And his                    forehead almost looked like there were puncture marks, and                    it was still swollen, and you could see where his beard was                    plucked out. He had reddish hair just like a... The best                    way to describe him would be a Norwegian, only he had olive-colored                  skin. He looked like a big, you know, rock-hard kinda 3-percent                  body mass, kind of a carpenter with big hands and big knuckles.                  And he looked like a guy that could, you know, make anything.                  Right? Only there was a... they fell to the middle part                  of his arm and leg. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And as he appeared, there was a big chasm that appeared in                  these clouds. There was all light all around. And I saw this                  little wooden bridge.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he said: <em>Don&rsquo;t                    cross the wooden bridge or the silver cord will break.</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I said: <em>What&rsquo;s                that?</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he says: <em>I will bring it into your remembrance. </em>Because,                  in other words, you know everything, you just have to remember                  it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remember                    going down the tunnel of light. I can remember this cord                    that seemed to come out from the base of my brain and my                    throat and it went down. It was like a cord of water. He                    called it &ldquo;the cord of living waters.&rdquo; It looked                  like a neon cord that kind of scintillated with light. Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he said: <em>If                you go, you won&rsquo;t be able to return.</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said: <em>Where am I?</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he said: <em>You&rsquo;re                      at the gates of paradise or heaven, the eternal NOW where                      there is no past, no present or future but everything that                    you think immediately is.</em> Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So I said: <em>Well, can you show me?</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So all                    of a sudden he&rsquo;s holding me by his right hand,                  and I&rsquo;m flying over the Golden City and I can see everything.                  And I would say, because there&rsquo;s no time and space, he                  showed me worlds, beings, planets, civilizations, that I&rsquo;m                  going to talk about a little bit today. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But literally                    the amount of things he showed me about the universe... The universe is an elemental particle in a                  larger universe. He told me about time-space. He told me about                  quantum physics. He told me everything. That&rsquo;s why I                  was about to go into nuclear physics at MIT. OK?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yep.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; He showed me beings that later on in life I&rsquo;d                  say<em>: Oh, I saw that in Star Wars.</em> OK? Because these                  things did exist. I saw them, and I was there, to their worlds. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I can&rsquo;t tell you how long it was, but in lineal time                  it had to be many centuries that I spent there. It wasn&rsquo;t                  a matter of a few minutes, like some people who have these                  near death experiences. I was there for an indeterminate period                  of time. It was so long, you know, and the amount of... and                  I only talk about a very tiny portion of what I know because                  it&rsquo;s so beyond the pale of human understanding, of civilizations                  and worlds and things that people cannot even grasp, so I don&rsquo;t                  talk about it. So all of a sudden...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; OK,                so you went to this place...</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BC: So                    after... I&rsquo;m back. And all of a sudden he&rsquo;s                  back on his side and now I&rsquo;m back on my side and I&rsquo;m                  thinking: <em>OK.</em> After this indeterminate time I&rsquo;m                  back on my side and I say: <em>Look</em>... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then                    he spoke to me telepathically; he didn&rsquo;t have                  to speak. And he said: <em>Well, what is your decision?</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I said: <em>I want to do the right thing.</em> And I said: <em>Well,                    if I&rsquo;m going to go back, what am I to do?</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And all                    of a sudden he&rsquo;s holding me with his hand again,                  and I&rsquo;m giddy. We must be 400 miles above the Earth and                  I look down. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This time                    he had on a thing, a tallit, and I didn&rsquo;t                  know what a tallit was because I was raised a little Roman                  Catholic boy. Right? So I saw this tallit and it was splattered                  with blood on it, this tallit, which is a prayer shawl. And                  I looked down over the Earth and I could see the edge of the                  horizon shimmering out across the dark of space.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he said: <em>Behold my blue jewel, the Earth. </em>Right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I said: <em>It&rsquo;s                alive!</em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said: <em>Yes! You know. </em>Right?In other words, the                  Earth is a living thing. Right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I heard                    a voice behind me that sounded like a deep voice, one of                    the... what we could call &ldquo;the angelic.&rdquo; And                  he said: <em>Behold the Voice of the Seven Thunders.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So the first time he said <em>Behold</em> he                    held his hand like this [gestures] -- and I don&rsquo;t know                    what that symbol means -- but he held his index and middle                  finger and pointed down toward the Earth and he said <em>Behold. </em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And all of a sudden I saw fireballs rising off the Earth everywhere,                  but particularly across continental America, a <em>lot</em> of                  them.And I thought: <em>Oh, this is a light show.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I mean,                    this is great, I&rsquo;m a little kid here, and I&rsquo;m                  still in my little hospital gown from having my surgery and                  I&rsquo;m free-floating up in space and I&rsquo;m looking down                  over, and I see all these fireballs. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then he looked back at me sternly, like: <em>You                      don&rsquo;t                    get it</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Part of                    it is, our civilization has been conceived almost like in                    a spiritual womb -- Earth -- and the timeline that we are                    selecting corporately will decide whether or not we&rsquo;re                  stillborn or aborted or whether our civilization will move                  on to join the Ben Elohim, the Council of the Eschaton, the                  advanced civilizations that are literally the incarnation of                  the Creator of the Universe, in whatever form, whether they&rsquo;re                  human, nonhuman, or other civilizations... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because                    at some point we&rsquo;re going to &ldquo;have contact.&rdquo; Well,                  how do we have contact? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What I&rsquo;ve presenting is that this is the transition                  point from &ldquo;the past, which is religion,&rdquo; which                  is based on ignorance. You know, like the Buddhists try to                  say -- a lot of people say I&rsquo;m a Buddhist, but I&rsquo;m                  not -- is that all pain and suffering is due to ignorance. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The real                    problem is that, in a future where we have a total understanding                    of ourselves and the nature of the universe, there&rsquo;s not even room for religion because religion is                  like recipe cards. It&rsquo;s irrelevant. It&rsquo;s like: <em>This                  is my past history; these are my recipe cards.</em> It&rsquo;s                  dogma. It&rsquo;s replacing the ever-present knowledge of what <em>is</em> right                  or wrong. Because you don&rsquo;t need to be told.

So the key to why Israel is so important is because Israel                    is an object-lesson for the whole planet.

Don&rsquo;t vaccinate your child, because these vaccines                    have been determined by globalists that want to poison your                    children with vaccines,</em> and I show them the technical                    truth. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it&rsquo;s                    harder for them to accept the fact that the vaccines, like                    in sub-Saharan Africa, have plasmids to destroy and cause                  infertility. Or the Guardisil vaccine now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got contacted by Desiree Rover just Friday night. She has                  a radio show in the Netherlands. She used my material and many                  others to kind of reference in her radio show to tell people: <em>Hey,                  this is a policy by globalists to sterilize little girls and                  destroy their health.</em> Right? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they&rsquo;re testing vaccines on populations that have                  no idea of what they&rsquo;re signing up for. And some of them                  get multiple vaccines and they&rsquo;re malnourished and it                  destroys their health and kills them. Many of them die.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; Yes.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s                    very hard for them to conceive that and then to go to the                    next stage. If they listen to all my shows and they listen                  to this message... </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I released                    three chapters of the scroll, and there&rsquo;s                  twelve chapters altogether. The first chapter I released in                  1999, which was a warning against America, which I delivered                  to 42 cities in Israel. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second                    chapter of the scroll I released in 2005 at Pastor Butch                    Paugh&rsquo;s Conference. And the third chapter of the                  scroll, which was tied to my talk at Conspiracy-Con 2008, I                  released this May. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to read the scroll but if you                  go to ClayandIron.com you can pull up those PowerPoints and                  those scrolls. And I&rsquo;m going to have that, as well as                  what&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;Prayer of the Twelve Stones.&rdquo; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People                    need to grasp this in their spirit. It needs to ring the                    bell, just like when you go to a Buddhist temple and you                    can feel the vibration of the truth. It&rsquo;s something                  spoken truthful. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What we&rsquo;re speaking tonight is not just wisdom and not                  just knowledge. It&rsquo;s what I call <em>spirit words.</em> It&rsquo;s                  words that need to ring their spirit no matter what religious                  background or lack of it, to know how desperately bad the times                  are. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;re not just looking at a depression here. We&rsquo;re                  looking at the prelude to a financial collapse that&rsquo;s                  a prelude to a false peace treaty that is the startup of a                  guaranteed thermonuclear, biological, chemical and scalar war                  that will destroy all life on this planet.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s                  the time scale? What would the time scale be for this?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t                  have all the answers at this point in time.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Sure.                    Give your best guess.<br>                <br>                BD:&nbsp; But I can give you some of the signs. The first thing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.                  The signs basically are this: When they divide the city of                  Jerusalem, they -- Jewish Rabbis, and this is Rabbinical Law                  -- have to have all the elements, the Kalal, the Ashes of the                  Red Heifer. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They have to have the Cohanim, and all the instruments. They                  can set up a tabernacle overnight. They have everything, Sea                  Cows, and curtains and everything. They can put it on the                  Temple Mount in one evening. OK? </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But once they start that sacrifice, which has to happen on                  the Feast of David, that starts the final clock ticking. That                  clock will start on that day. And exactly 1230 days later is                  the Feast of Purim, which goes back to <em>hamen</em>. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And people say: <em>Well, why would these things be encoded?</em> Like                  the Bible coded in the Bible? It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re                  hearing Voice and Intentions from the highest Creator of the                  universe that&rsquo;s speaking down through the higher dimensional                  planes to our world that imprints on a supernatural book that                  transcends time and space, which is in the Bible. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That&rsquo;s why the Bible code&rsquo;s                    there. People say: <em>Well,                    why are those things there?</em> It&rsquo;s there because                    it transcends the dimensional planes of time-space because                    it&rsquo;s beyond time-space. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Yes. But the Illuminati know all this. They&rsquo;ve                  already got this.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Well, they&rsquo;re trying to steer the timeline                  away from its intention. Because the future is not solid --                  it&rsquo;s liquid. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Sure.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; We                    have a role to play here. And when I was brought to the Council,                  they were saying, you know, you need to take this seriously. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s not written. It&rsquo;s                    not determined at this point in existence, or revelation                    of the spirit, what will be that pathway, whether we will                    go into a birthing room and have a wonderful delivery of                    mankind, or whether we will have an annihilation of the human                    race. Or something in between, where a great deal of destruction                  occurs and a tiny remnant survives.&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:&nbsp; So                why are you here in Oceanside, for example?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; I                    don&rsquo;t                  completely know.
