<br><br>

DAVID WILCOCK
(DW):  Okay. Now, Pete, one of the questions that I had for you is
that you had mentioned before that you didn&rsquo;t like the term
<I>consciousness
field</I>,
and you would prefer the term <I>information
field</I>.
I was wondering if you could explain why that distinction was made in
your discussion?

<br><br>


Dr. PETE
PETERSON (PP):  Because, to me, the <I>consciousness
field</I>
deals with consciousness and the <I>information
field</I>
is mostly unconscious.

<br><br>


DW:  I&rsquo;d like to double click
on that and get more information on that link.


<br><br>


PP:  Well,
[laughs] the <I>information
field</I>
holds everything in the known universe, and, there&rsquo;s
consciousness<I>
&ndash; </I>each
person has their own consciousness and their own <I>consciousness
field</I>.
It&rsquo;s one of the characteristics of individuality, or I&rsquo;ll
say information field. It&rsquo;s one of the characteristics of the
information field that I think the best English word for is the soul
or spirit. The individual consciousness field of each person is very,
very different.


<br><br>


The
information field holds everyone&rsquo;s consciousness, while the
consciousness field holds each individual&rsquo;s consciousness, or
their... I guess we could say spiritual characteristic, though I use
<I>spiritual</I>
in a very different method than it&rsquo;s used by religions.

<br><br>


DW:  My
witness, Daniel, referred to <I>spirit</I>
as the <I>intellect</I>.
He said that the intellectual aspects of mind are non-local, that
they&rsquo;re not happening in the nervous system at all. They&rsquo;re
in the field where those cognitive processes take place.

<br><br>


PP:  I
absolutely agree with that. They&rsquo;re definitely non-localized.
They&rsquo;re in the consciousness field, which is not localized with
the person whatsoever. It&rsquo;s everywhere and every-when.


<br><br>


It&rsquo;s not
a device. It&rsquo;s not a part of the neural or even non-neural
anatomy. It&rsquo;s a <I>field</I>.
It&rsquo;s like a magnetic field or an electric field in some
respects &ndash; in the respects of a field &ndash; but it&rsquo;s
non-local, even though it appears to be somewhat centered around the
actual individual.


<br><br>


It may be what
some people call the <I>aura</I>.
But it also has tentacles, if you would, that extend through time and
space to infinity.


<br><br>


DW:  There&rsquo;s
a Russian scientist named Budakovski who takes a holographic
photograph of a healthy raspberry plant, shines that light into a
raspberry tumor, and the tumor cells rearrange into healthy raspberry
cells and it grows a new plant. Are you familiar with anything like
that?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I
am. I wasn&rsquo;t aware of that experiment and would very much like
to be, because I&rsquo;m looking for things that I can instrument and
observe, to try to come to some conclusions. But that to me is... it
would be a necessity that things be that way.

<br><br>


DW:  Right.


<br><br>


PP:  I&rsquo;d
like to be familiar with the experiment; but, for example, I found
out in human medicine, for example, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion
-- and feel I can prove that to any competent neuro-anatomist -- that
the DNA is merely a factory that generates the physical part of the
body. The DNA gets its information from the informational field in
how to do that. So you find that the informational field is eternal
and holds the <I>spirit</I>
or the <I>being</I>
or the <I>information</I>
of the person in perfection &ndash; whereas the perfection then runs
through the factory. If the factory is missing the thing that puts
the wheels on, the wheels are going to fall off, if you would.


<br><br>


And so, the
DNA problems that you get with human health and anatomies are errors
that are in the DNA, which it appears, are pretty much passed down
through the family tree. But there&rsquo;s also information that
comes down through the family tree, and that&rsquo;s shown by a lot
of work that was done by Joseph Chilton Pearce, for example, reported
by him in <I>The
Magical Child</I>.



<br><br>


There&rsquo;s information that&rsquo;s
transmitted to heart tissue &ndash; actually brain tissue that&rsquo;s
in the heart &ndash; and that holds most of the person&rsquo;s
information about emotional things, and a lot of information about
taste.


<br><br>


For example, they found people with
heart transplants all of a sudden loved mustard when they couldn&rsquo;t
stand it beforehand. And they find that the person that was the donor
loved mustard. They find that the person that was the donor was a
very loving person, where the person who lost their heart lost it
because of a lot of frustration and a lot of stress and they were a
person that wasn&rsquo;t a loving person. Now they become a very
loving person, and the people around them have no idea how to relate
to them.


<br><br>


DW:  Does each person have the same
degree of contact with this information field, or consciousness
field?

<br><br>


PP:  I would doubt that they do
because they&rsquo;re all individual. For example, there are people
who just seem to be informationally troubled, if you would, which has
nothing to do with being, you know, personally troubled. But they
seem to have problems, even when you go in and correct things in
their...

<br><br>


This is from a health field, because
I spent many years in that field building medical instruments.
They&rsquo;re all computerized and we had, you know, years and years
and thousands of patient visits that we could go back and take a look
at and correlate the long-term data. That was the instruments that
have been out there now for 28 years in the marketplace, and some
16,000-plus instruments around the world, and well over a
million-and-a-half patient visits.

<br><br>


So we correlated that data and have
shown that much of this must be the way that things are. So, like the
statement that you made was one that I absolutely agree with, that
out of necessity there has to be an informational field, and out of
necessity there has to be something that drives the DNA.

<br><br>


Now we&rsquo;ve
done some experiments showing that we can generate this field around
the body and the body will act as if the DNA were perfect. If they
had a genetic disease, the genetic disease goes away. Now with the
advent of stem cell research, we find out that we can use a person&rsquo;s
own stem cells in the body and heighten this field around the body,
and the cells they had, that are replicable cells, that had a genetic
problem, the genetic problem goes away because the informational
field holds the perfect information rather than the flawed
information of the gene itself.

<br><br>


DW:  Well,
that&rsquo;s like the Budakovski raspberry thing I told you.

<br><br>


PP:  Exactly.

<br><br>


DW:  The tumor was transformed.
Yeah.

<br><br>


PP:  Yep.

<br><br>


DW:  How can someone strengthen
their contact with this field that they have? Do you have any
exercises, or ways, or technology perhaps, anything that they could
do?

<br><br>


PP:  I have technology that could do
that, and that&rsquo;s one of the products that I intend to come out
with once we get the laboratory and factory completely built.

<br><br>


DW:  Well, that&rsquo;s tantalizing,
but what have you done? What could you do? What could it do for
someone?

<br><br>


PP:  We&rsquo;ll know that once we
get it done and do the testing on it, so... I know what I think it
would do and, you know, we&rsquo;ve been very successful with these
instruments. The American Medical Association publishes every year
the number of clinical diagnoses that their doctors, they feel that
their doctors got correct. This year it jumped all the way up to 6%
from 5% the previous year. We have 85% of the patients that use the
medical equipment that I&rsquo;m talking about, 85% of the patients
feel that within two days they don&rsquo;t have what they had when
they came.

<br><br>


DW:  Do you believe in acupuncture
points on the body?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, I have to believe in them
because they&rsquo;re there, and you can go to Radio Shack, or you
can go to Harbor Freight and buy a $4.00 or $5.00 dollar meter and
adjust the meter appropriately and run those on the body and find
every one of the points, put a little dot there; go compare yourself
to an acupuncture chart, and you&rsquo;ll look exactly the same.

<br><br>


I did find out
how the acupuncture system works. There have been a number of people
that postulated it, but they didn&rsquo;t show that it worked. I
worked with Dr. Jean Claude De Roche at the French Institute of
Science. He&rsquo;s a very famous acupuncturist. He taught the
Chinese acupuncture. They did away with acupuncture in the &rsquo;20s
and made it illegal, even though it was practiced down every alley,
and then during the Cultural Revolution they brought it back.


<br><br>


The reason for that was they had a
huge plague and acupuncture wouldn&rsquo;t cure the plague but
penicillin would. So the French missionaries brought in penicillin
and so they did away with acupuncture and went with penicillin. But
acupuncture has its definite uses, as does the sister of acupuncture,
which is Chinese herbal medicine. It makes sense [that] if you put
certain chemicals in the body and certain precursors, you&rsquo;re
going to get certain chemical reactions out of the body.


<br><br>


So, anyway, the acupuncture system
is very interesting. What we did is we injected radioactive potassium
into each acupuncture point while the person was under a high-speed
CAT-scan machine, and we found that the radioactivity moved directly
to the organ associated with that point...

<br><br>


KERRY CASSIDY
(KC):  Oh, wow.

<br><br>


PP:  ...for the 3,300 years that the
Neijing has been around talking about it, and for the 6,200 years
that Ayurvedic medicine has been talking about it.


<br><br>


So we found
there was a direct correlation to, not only to the organ system, but
to actual parts of it. For example, down the outside of the thumb you
have a point that gives you information about the entire lymphatic
system &ndash; just below the first joint. But above the first joint,
it talks about the lymphatics that are in the tonsillary ring.


<br><br>


When we inject here [touching the
side his left thumb], the radioactive material goes to the tonsillary
ring. When we inject here [touching same thumb, but closer to bottom
knuckle], it goes the whole lymphatic system.


<br><br>


You go down [indicating different
points down the side of the thumb] and, you know, it goes on down the
body.


<br><br>


The same thing, you know, if you
work across the hand, you have lymph and lung and circulation and
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. [pointing to different places on his
hand] You come over here and you have the heart and the small
intestine. You can go down and inject here and it goes to the mitral
valve. Here it goes to the aorta. Here it goes to, you know, this
chamber, that chamber, etcetera, etcetera.


<br><br>


Then you go down on the feet, the
acupuncture points are the same thing. We also found that the
acupuncture points, the acupuncture meridians aren&rsquo;t veins,
they aren&rsquo;t vessels.


<br><br>


The
acupuncture <I>meridians</I>,
as they&rsquo;re called, aren&rsquo;t really meridians. They&rsquo;re
made up of a... If you&rsquo;ve ever cleaned a game animal or a
chicken, you&rsquo;ll notice that between the organs &ndash; or done
surgery &ndash; between the organs there&rsquo;s a white filmy layer.
That layer is built up like a baklava. It&rsquo;s built up in a
number of layers, and each of those layers is a capacitive,
conductive surface, not meant for conducting materials such as
radioactive potassium, [laughs] but it works as does anything in the
body.


<br><br>


The body is a biological mechanism.
It works like the intestine does, peristaltically, like the heart
does, peristaltically. It&rsquo;s ionic in nature, so it&rsquo;s
polarized, so it pulsates and moves information. So that system was
an information system. The points are just above and below each
joint, and you have them down each side of the hand. They&rsquo;re
around an area that&rsquo;s about a 45-degree angle toward the
finger. And you can take something like a ball point pen &ndash; I
don&rsquo;t see one here [picks up a pen] &ndash; but you can take,
not the point of the pen but the point of the case, and you can probe
about a 45-degree angle just above and below each joint.


<br><br>


Most people don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s
a joint just like this joint and this joint and this joint [pointing
to the back of his had with the pen], right down here at the wrist.
You can probe those places, and on ones where you&rsquo;re having a
problem with the organ or organ system, you&rsquo;ll find a little
hard nodule under the skin, just above and below the joint, at about
45 [degrees].


<br><br>


If you rub
back and forth past those, ones that aren&rsquo;t too bad, ones you
don&rsquo;t have a bad problem, you&rsquo;ll feel the little nodule
but it will actually palpate like it were a little grain of rice
filled with coarse sand. You&rsquo;ll feel a grittiness or a
graininess. And you go up below the joint and above the joint, and so
you can tell where you have a problem.

<br><br>


Now, what acupuncturists don&rsquo;t
want you to know is, if you take something that&rsquo;s a little
milder rounded and rub that point, it&rsquo;ll feel really good if
you have a problem there. And if you take a piece of metal and do the
same thing, different points will feel differently because the metal
thing tends to discharge an excess of electric field there, and
plastic would tend to charge up a point of extra field there.

<br><br>


It turns out
there&rsquo;s a type of material called an <I>electret</I>.
An <I>electret</I>
is to electric field like a <I>magnet</I>
is to a magnetic field. So there&rsquo;s a way of putting a permanent
electric charge on a piece of plastic.


<br><br>


All the microphones in little tape
recorders you&rsquo;ve ever seen, 99% of them are electret
microphones where you have a little piece of film with a permanent
charge. As the voice hits it, the film vibrates. Then there&rsquo;s a
piece of metal next to it and you measure the voltage between the
two, feed it into the device, and that&rsquo;s where the voice signal
comes from.

<br><br>


So you can
make an electret and rub the various points and it&rsquo;ll just feel
really good. And you rub it one time or 50 times, and all of a
sudden, it&rsquo;ll quit feeling good and you move onto the next
point. If you do that on your fingers and on your feet, you&rsquo;ll
feel really, really good. It&rsquo;ll normally alleviate almost any
problem you have.


<br><br>


That&rsquo;s what an acupuncturist
does. They can find where those places are that you need to have a
treatment and do it that way. Another way to do it is use an
acupuncture needle and stick it into the point to charge it or
discharge it, and there&rsquo;s a way to put it in to do either.

<br><br>


So, one of the
products that we came up with is two little pieces of metal that you
can have little indentations on them and you can rub your points.
Those pieces of metal have a number of holes in them, and people
asked us what the holes were for, if it was critical to the use of
the unit, and I said: <I>No.
That&rsquo;s where you tie a shoelace, and if you loan it to
somebody, you keep one hand with a shoelace around because they won&rsquo;t
give it back to you, it feels so good.</I>

<br><br>


[laughter]

<br><br>


PP:  So we have tooling to make
those and I probably need to make another batch of them. But anyway,
we found that these were there. Now, it turns out that these points &ndash;
like this is the lymphatic system here [pointing to the back of his
hand], and this is the lung system here, and if you go clear to the
end of what... and there are points up the body. If you go clear to
the end of where that meridian is, they all end at a tooth root. The
teeth are piezoelectric. When you squeeze a piezoelectric material,
it generates a voltage.


<br><br>


DW:  Discharge.

<br><br>


PP:  Or if you take a piece of
piezoelectric material and apply a voltage, it expands or contracts.
The teeth are piezoelectric. So that&rsquo;s why you should take very
good care of your teeth and don&rsquo;t get a root canal unless you
absolutely have to have it, and, not that you&rsquo;ll die, but your
health will go down.


<br><br>


So there are some things that we
have, these little devices, will make up for that and will charge you
up. Especially people who are missing a lot of teeth get a real, real
success from that, and they have very, very pronounced little
nodules, and their nodules are usually hard like a rock. If they keep
massaging them from time to time until it quits feeling... It feels
as good as a scratch on a good itch, and when it quits feeling good,
move to the next one. And after a period of time you&rsquo;ll feel
the granularity, and after a period of time it&rsquo;ll just get
softer and there won&rsquo;t be any little nodule under the skin.

<br><br>


DW:  My mother had a large nodule
right here and it finally went away, but she worked on it for a
couple of years. It was on the middle finger.

<br><br>


PP:  I have one here, as a matter of
fact. [laughs] And it comes and goes.

<br><br>


DW:  So you&rsquo;re saying that the
tissues around the organs have an ionic transfer system, which is...

<br><br>


PP:  No. To
the organ. They&rsquo;re around the organ, but they go all the way up
the body. If you start stripping out neural tissue... in fact, it&rsquo;s
kind of an interesting thing. Most people don&rsquo;t know that lions
and tigers never eat muscle tissue; it&rsquo;s highly toxic. They
strip out the blood veins, the vessels, the neural tissue. They eat
intestines and they eat, you know, the heart and the internal organs.
They don&rsquo;t eat muscle tissue.

<br><br>


DW:  Really?

<br><br>


PP:  Yep. If
they feed &rsquo;em muscle tissue and they only give &rsquo;em muscle
tissue, they&rsquo;ll eat it, but they get very ill. It&rsquo;s very
highly toxic. But people eat all the muscle tissue and throw the good
parts away.

<br><br>


BILL RYAN
(BR):  Does that mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t eat a good raw steak if
you&rsquo;re a meat eater?

<br><br>


PP:  Unfortunately. [sighs] It&rsquo;s
very obvious that I eat anything that&rsquo;s slower than I am.
[laughter] But that does mean that. As good as it tastes, it&rsquo;s
not good for you.

<br><br>


DW: I&rsquo;m just trying to
understand...

<br><br>


PP:  That&rsquo;s
also why the kosher meats have a very specific way of sneaking up on
the animal and not alarming them and very mercifully putting them out
of their... demise. It&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t want that
animal to get excited and release a lot of toxins into the muscle
tissue.

<br><br>


DW:  Hm. This is not...

<br><br>


PP:  Whether they know it or not.

<br><br>


DW:  This is not the typical nervous
system you&rsquo;re talking about, with sodium...

<br><br>


PP:  No. There&rsquo;s no nervous
system there. It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.

<br><br>


DW:  Right.

<br><br>


PP:  It&rsquo;s
a completely different system. There was a Korean fellow, Kim Bong
Jung, who postulated that there was... He said: <I>I
found the neural system and here are pictures of the little tubules
that carry a yellow fluid,</I>
etcetera, etcetera. And that&rsquo;s all been reported.


<br><br>


You can find
that all over the Internet and you can find it all over medical
literature. But what it doesn&rsquo;t report is that four years later
he committed suicide and said he was sorry for perpetrating such a
hoax. There isn&rsquo;t that system. People looked for it and
couldn&rsquo;t find it and finally he just had to admit that he made
it all up.

<br><br>


DW:  Hm.

<br><br>


PP:  And so, that isn&rsquo;t the
system. We found how it worked because we injected the radioactive
potassium and then we looked at it and watched it go through the
body. And it goes exceedingly fast. If you took blood from the tip of
this finger and traced it back to the heart, it doesn&rsquo;t move
very fast. It moves very, very slowly. It doesn&rsquo;t race through
your veins.


<br><br>


But if you inject the radioactive
potassium there, we had to get a higher speed CAT-scan machine to
even see it. It really races. It&rsquo;s the frequency of this. It&rsquo;s
like milking a cow or a goat &ndash; it&rsquo;s a peristaltic action,
and it really races through there. It&rsquo;s a very high frequency.


<br><br>


DW:  Now, you&rsquo;re saying this
is all happening, some interface with the consciousness field or the
information field?

<br><br>


PP:  The informational field.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay. Could you explain that?
What&rsquo;s the energetic component?

<br><br>


PP:  I really... Yeah, that&rsquo;s
a couple hour lecture.

<br><br>


DW:  Well, could I get the elevator
version? [laughter]

<br><br>


PP:  There&rsquo;s not really an
elevator version. It depends where it is, what it is, what the
problem is, which meridian it is.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay. If an organ is
dysfunctional, why would it matter what&rsquo;s going on in your
hand?

<br><br>


PP:  It
doesn&rsquo;t. It <I>makes</I>
what&rsquo;s going on in your hand. It creates what&rsquo;s going on
in your hand.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay. So, because they&rsquo;re
the extremities, somehow...


<br><br>


PP:  Because we&rsquo;re built that
way.




KC:  You&rsquo;re saying you can
either heal it on the hand or you can heal it directly on the organ,
right?

<br><br>


PP:  No.

<br><br>


KC:  No?

<br><br>


PP:  No, I wasn&rsquo;t saying that
at all. What I&rsquo;m saying is that problems in the organ manifest
themselves both physically and informationally at the appropriate
points on the body.


<br><br>


Now, if you
think about it, when you build a car; any car that you&rsquo;ve had
in the last 10 or 12 years has an electrical connector under the
seat. You plug a computer in there and it&rsquo;ll say: <I>The
oxygen sensor&rsquo;s bad. The brakes are getting weak.</I>
It&rsquo;ll say a number of things.

<br><br>


So, let&rsquo;s
assume that somehow, whether divinely or by genetics, we were
designed. Why not design a system where you could test the thing? I
mean, we don&rsquo;t come with an operator&rsquo;s manual, but maybe
we come with a system that is very easy for us to find out what the
problem is and then alter things.

<br><br>


Now, one thing
we found out is that every substance has an informational field
around it. We found out a way to take that substance, place it on a
device, and from the device find a numerical signature for that
information field. Then we found a way, therefore, to store it in a
computer.


<br><br>


Now we can
take the computer and run that information back out and <I>generate</I>
an informational field. We can make that field large, so it surrounds
the body. And we can then measure in real time at these points, some
of which -- most of which -- are acupuncture points, and some aren&rsquo;t.
There are some acupuncture points that we find don&rsquo;t do
anything, even though they&rsquo;re classical points.

<br><br>


Now, you know,
6,000 years ago, or 3,300 years ago, they didn&rsquo;t have any kind
of measurement instruments, so we now have a bio-feedback system that
will actually do that.

<br><br>


DW:  A lot of our audience is going
to think of the Rife machine when you say these numerical signatures.

<br><br>


PP:  That&rsquo;s very unfortunate.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay?

<br><br>


PP:  Because there&rsquo;s no
correlation whatever. It has nothing to do with the Rife machine.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay.

<br><br>


KC:  Didn&rsquo;t you work for Royal
Rife?

<br><br>


PP:  I worked for Rife for a period
of time, yes. I know how his instruments worked and it has no bearing
on this whatsoever. This is a very gross, mechanical type of thing.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  And it doesn&rsquo;t work at
all like anybody thinks. That&rsquo;s another story. But, anyway...
threw me off a little bit here in my thinking about this.

<br><br>


DW:  You can play a signature for a
specific compound.

<br><br>


PP:  Yeah, we can make a signature
of a compound, and what happens is, the body will react to that
informational field as if you had given the person that substance. So
you can go to an acupuncture point and get information from it that
you can graph and chart on a machine, and it will tell you whether
that organ is in a type of inflammatory process, or in a degenerative
process, and how much, how long it&rsquo;s been there, whether it&rsquo;s
winning the battle or losing the battle. Then you can put the person
in an informational field from a substance that you think may solve
that problem, and ask the body. The body will react exactly as if
you&rsquo;ve given that substance, so you can select a type of
treatment.

<br><br>


BR:  When somebody is given a
placebo, are they affecting their own informational field?

<br><br>


PP:  Absolutely. Placebos work 50
percent of the time, and it isn&rsquo;t because placebos have a
physical effect. They have a mental effect in some instances, and
they have an informational effect in some instances.

<br><br>


BR:  So you should be able to affect
your own informational field without a placebo.


<br><br>


PP:  Yes.
People asked me when I built these very complex computerized machines
that do the diagnosis and selection of treatment, they asked me:
<I>What&rsquo;s
your goal for this machine?</I>
And I said: <I>My
goal is, when the doctor throws the thing in the Dempsey Dumpster,
and just does it.</I>

<br><br>


That can be done. However, the
machine takes away his emotional state and his emotional interference
with it, and the patient&rsquo;s emotional state and the patient&rsquo;s
emotional characteristics with it.

<br><br>


But, one of
the machines that I want to come out with in the future is one that&rsquo;s
a bio-feedback device that allows the patient to put himself in an
informational or mental state that affects the problem with the body.
That can be done. It can easily be done, and other than gross
poisoning, or gross over-consumption of something...

<br><br>


For example,
it&rsquo;s very beneficial to have vitamin A. We don&rsquo;t get
enough vitamin A in our bodies. But, you take too much vitamin A and
you&rsquo;ll find yourself gaining water and getting ascites, and
some people die from it. Many people <I>almost</I>
die from it. So, too much of a good thing is too much, no matter how
good the thing is.

<br><br>


DW:  A lot of people are going to
want to know, is anybody using this technology? Are there any doctors
that are using it?

<br><br>


PP:  There are, right now, in the
United States, that I know of, 18,000 clinics.

<br><br>


DW:  Eighteen
<I>thousand</I>?

<br><br>


PP:  Eighteen
thousand clinics using this technology. I taught seven companies how
to make it. About five other companies came in and stole the
information from them, which, if they&rsquo;d come and asked me, I&rsquo;d
have handed it to them.

<br><br>


DW:  Hm.

<br><br>


PP:  Because I
knew it was going to need 20 or 25 years out there before it got
itself established. And so what I did was I let other people do it,
and I ran around in front of them like the man that runs in front of
a curling stone and sweeping a pathway for it. I went around in front
of them sweeping a pathway in front of the FDA.


<br><br>


[Ed. note:
Pete is talking about the Scottish sport of Curling, in which a
Curling Stone is slid on ice. A man with a broom goes in front of it,
sweeping the ice, smoothing the surface so that the stone can slide
more freely.]

<br><br>


We got a very, very good publicity
man whose mother had been given, I don&rsquo;t know, eight or ten
weeks to live, and we kept her alive for another 17 years.

<br><br>


DW:  Oh my gosh.

<br><br>


PP:  He felt very happy about that,
and so he jumped on our bandwagon. Out of that, it finally ended up,
about 10 or 12 years later there&rsquo;s actually an alternative
medical branch of the FDA, and that branch handles things like we
have. In the meantime, I spent a lot of money, and a lot of time and
effort, and got this device actually approved by the FDA.

<br><br>


DW:  That was my next question.
There must be publications. There must be documentation out there.

<br><br>


PP:  Well, the
only documentation I know is, when you put my name into a computer,
it&rsquo;ll come up and tell what a fraud this device is, and how
it&rsquo;s a quack device. But if you find out who put that in there,
you&rsquo;ll find out that he says the same thing about a lot of
other things that work. Then if you go and watch the man, you&rsquo;ll
find that the checks that he cashes at the bank are from large
pharmaceutical companies and from the government at times.

<br><br>


DW:  Right.

<br><br>


KC:  So, what
name are they going to put into the computer for that device?

<br><br>


PP:  I&rsquo;m not going to say
that. I&rsquo;m not interested in thousands of people associating
that and being able to show their friends that I&rsquo;m a fraud.
Anybody who wants to know if it&rsquo;s a fraud, come to me. I&rsquo;ll
give you the closest doctor, and you can go there and ask the doctor
whether his 3, 5, 7, 10,000 patients that went there, and two days
later walked out without their problem, think that it&rsquo;s a
fraud.

<br><br>


Now, I know
it&rsquo;s not 100% placebo because placebos only work 50% of the
time. And even though the medical people -- the AMA -- says their
doctors only get 5% of their clinical diagnoses correct... If they
only get, you know, 5% or 6% now this year, of their clinical
diagnoses correct, what do you think they get correct with the
treatment? You know why they say <I>practicing
</I>medicine<I>.</I>

<br><br>


Or on the
other hand, watch the TV show <I>House</I>,
and in each incidence they tried five, or six, or seven treatments,
almost killing the patient each time, and then find out what the
solution is. You know, he&rsquo;s supposed to be the best
diagnostician in the world, you know, on television. But it&rsquo;s
very true to life. It comes out of Canada. They&rsquo;re a lot more
frank there. And, you know, you get the picture of <I>practicing
medicine</I>.
They don&rsquo;t have an idea. They don&rsquo;t have a way to have an
idea.

<br><br>


So I&rsquo;m
now ready, after 28 years of having this device out there and about
somewhere between, oh, probably $1.2 to $4 million, or maybe more,
patient visits behind it; all computerized. In the medical
terminology, it&rsquo;s <I>anecdotal</I>
because the patient can&rsquo;t tell you if they&rsquo;re well or
they don&rsquo;t have the symptom any longer &ndash; that&rsquo;s
illegal.


<br><br>


But, I&rsquo;m
now ready to go up against any one of them, because I can prove that
my diagnoses with this type of machine are absolutely correct,
because when they go look with conventional diagnostic tools and
equipment, I&rsquo;ll see the problem as much as 20 years before it
manifests itself in the body where common medical things can test it.

<br><br>


How can I prove that? Well, I&rsquo;ll
wait 20 years and prove it. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve done.
That&rsquo;s why I have 27 years of testing done on it. That&rsquo;s
why I have people that came and thought it was a fraud and didn&rsquo;t
accept the medication, but I watched them over a period of time and
saw them eventually die of what I told them they would die from.

<br><br>


So I now have
enough evidence. I&rsquo;m ready to go and do that, except <I>I&rsquo;m</I>
not going to do that because I don&rsquo;t have any desire to be
assassinated. I have people that have more testicles than I have that
are willing to do it... pardon my 10 years in the Marine Corps.

<br><br>


DW:  You said there&rsquo;s a lot of
clones of this technology out there, people have stolen it from you
and...

<br><br>


PP:  They
didn&rsquo;t steal it from me. They stole it from other people. I
gave it away, so they couldn&rsquo;t steal it from me. If they&rsquo;d
come to me, I&rsquo;d have given it to them.

<br><br>


DW:  Is it variable in terms of how
well they work, like...

<br><br>


PP:  Oh,
absolutely. The first thing I did was... in my instrument, when you
touch the body, in the beginning, the person doesn&rsquo;t know where
the points are, so I put a Point Locator. And the Point Locator made
a tone, which almost everybody likened it to the sound of a cow that
was dying. [laughter] Okay?


<br><br>


So, when I
gave the people how to build this thing, they built it, and everybody
says: <I>Oh,
that sounds like a cow dying</I>,
so they changed the tone. They eliminated 80% of the effectiveness of
the machine, because the tone carried a lot of information, that, if
the doctor had only persisted with it for a month, he could then hear
that tone and he could cut down diagnosis time from 35 to 40 minutes
to 2&frac12; to 3 minutes.

<br><br>


DW:  Wow.

<br><br>


PP:  It just
became natural. He&rsquo;d: <I>Oh,
I know what that means. I know what that tone means. Let me try this,
let me try that</I>.

He can dial up
on the machine now some 850,000 different substances that are in this
world. All the medications of every medical system known; all the
herbals of every herbal system known; all the magic healing potions
of every magic healing potion system known; all the chemicals that
are out there that are man-made; all the chemicals that you find in
nature; all the vitamins; all the minerals; all the pharmaceuticals
in the homeopathic pharmacopeia, and in the allopathic pharmacopeia.
Everything&rsquo;s there. So, you can do it; the machine will help
you sort those out and find out exactly what will alleviate the
problem.

<br><br>


And many times
you&rsquo;ll find something that will alleviate a problem in the, for
example, the small intestine, but find that it&rsquo;ll aggravate the
neural system. So you say: <I>Oh,
well there must be another medication that&rsquo;ll work and not
counteract something here.</I>
So you can go back and find that particular medication. Now you know
what to give.


<br><br>


Now, you can
ask it: <I>Okay,
if I&rsquo;m going to give this, how much should I give?</I>
It&rsquo;ll tell you an exact amount. And like everything in nature,
there&rsquo;s a bell curve produced, a curve that looks like a bell,
and you want that medication that&rsquo;s right at the peak of the
bell curve. You want just that amount that&rsquo;ll produce that
reaction and &ndash; BANG &ndash; you give it.


<br><br>


Many times
when we give the medications to a patient, they&rsquo;ll bounce up
and down like they were at Disneyland on Mr. Toad&rsquo;s Wild Ride,
and they&rsquo;ll say: <I>Ah,
ah, I&rsquo;ve had that pain for 20 years and now it&rsquo;s gone.</I>



<br><br>


Did we heal
him? No. Did we cure them? No. Why do I say: <I>No</I>?
Because it&rsquo;s against the law.


<br><br>


Do they believe they were healed?
Yes. Did they believe they were cured? Yes. What makes the
difference?

<br><br>


DW:  One thing that I think is
really important is, if this video is out there online, there&rsquo;s
going to be a lot of people that want to claim that they have this
technology to profit from it.

<br><br>


PP:  Oh, absolutely.

<br><br>


DW:  And it may not be the one
you&rsquo;re actually talking about.

<br><br>


PP:  Absolutely.

<br><br>


DW:  How do we prevent against that?
Is there any search term we can give people on Google?

<br><br>


PP:  I don&rsquo;t know that we can
prevent against it.

<br><br>


DW:  Or doctors that are actually
using the right one? Or...

<br><br>


PP:  The problem is that the first,
about 6000 doctors I trained, and they had machines that moo-ed like
a cow and it was really good, and after that it went downhill. So,
again, I&rsquo;m building a laboratory and a factory where I will
produce these, and instead of having to do, like you have to do
today, pay between $12 and $50,000 dollars for one of the machines...

<br><br>


DW:  Oh.

<br><br>


PP:  I&rsquo;ve got one that&rsquo;s
built in a fountain pen and we&rsquo;ll probably sell it for around
$99.

<br><br>


DW:  Wow.

<br><br>


BR:  But there are similar healing
modalities in existence, which is...

<br><br>


PP:  Oh, there are some that work
beautifully.

<br><br>


BR:  Radionics, you know. Go on...

<br><br>


PP:  Well, yeah. There are radionics
machines that...

<br><br>


BR:  I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s
the same. I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s something that works...


<br><br>


PP:  Yeah, it works very well.

<br><br>


BR:  ...in the informational field.

<br><br>


PP:  Oh, it works very well, and it
works with, on... Exactly right. It works through the informational
field.

<br><br>


DW:  Have you heard of the SCANAR,
the Russian SCANAR?

<br><br>


PP:  I&rsquo;ve definitely heard of
the SCANAR, having spent about, oh, eight months with the people
doing it...

<br><br>


DW:  Really?

<br><br>


PP:  ...and
working together with them. There&rsquo;s another machine for pain.
It&rsquo;s called the Acuscope, which was brought to this country by
Tony Nebrinski who was the KGB man in this country looking for
medical technology to send home to Russia.

<br><br>


DW:  There&rsquo;s
a guy named Dr. Hartmut Muller who built this LED thing that you put
on your skin. Is that another one that you think works?

<br><br>


PP:  No.

<br><br>


DW:  It doesn&rsquo;t work?

<br><br>


PP:  No, I didn&rsquo;t say that.

<br><br>


DW:  Oh.

<br><br>


PP:  I said there are things that
work a lot better. That&rsquo;s what I meant to say.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay. But people can also, as
you said, massage these points on their hands.

<br><br>


PP:  The best
medical machine I ever invented were these two little things we call
Acu-Combs [Ed note: did a search and did not find this device, so the
correct spelling of this is unknown.] that you just rub your points
with and get well.

<br><br>


DW:  Is there a way people could
build those on their own?

<br><br>


PP:  They
probably could as soon as they saw one, but it&rsquo;s easier and
cheaper to buy one from me, because I paid thousands of dollars for
the tooling and they stamp them out like...

<br><br>


DW:  Great.

<br><br>


PP:  ...shells coming out of a
machine gun, and they put &rsquo;em in a tumbler and tumble them, and
they actually have electric material that we invented to actually do
the charging. It&rsquo;s interesting in that you can take one of the
units and do it.


<br><br>


By the way,
you can find out how you&rsquo;ll react to any food. One of the best
things is that anything that goes in the body, you say: <I>How
do my organs react to that?</I>

<br><br>


There&rsquo;s a reason that the
highest-paid doctor is the anesthesiologist. It&rsquo;s because he
has to pay the most insurance. And I think... I may be wrong. You&rsquo;d
have to check what it is these days, but when I was working on it,
two out of every 100 people were killed by the anesthetic.


<br><br>


BR:  That&rsquo;s
about<B>
</B>right. [overtalk]<B>
</B>


<br><br>


PP:  This thing will tell you
exactly because this finger and the distal side of the middle finger
tells you about food absorption here, and allergy here. It will tell
you whether you have an allergic dispensation toward that medicine.
That anesthetic, it&rsquo;ll tell you how your body will react to it.

<br><br>


KC:  How does it tell you?

<br><br>


PP:  By making an indication.
There&rsquo;s an indication on a meter and on a chart. When you learn
how to read the meter and learn how to read the chart, which can be
taught in approximately one minute, you can tell whether you&rsquo;re
going to have an allergic reaction or not.


<br><br>


Another thing we found was, out of a
major university&rsquo;s animal husbandry department, we found that
there are 33 substances that all humans and all animals are allergic
to. Most of them are phenolic compounds that have a 6-sided benzene
ring in the molecule, and a couple are hormones, and a couple are
proteins.


<br><br>


We found out
that we can measure here and we can find out <I>exactly</I>
&ndash; if you have allergies, <I>exactly</I>
what you&rsquo;re allergic to. Then we can take that material and
prepare it homeopathically and give you a couple drops under the
tongue and that allergy will disappear entirely.

<br><br>


Then, after a
period of time, it may come back, and we&rsquo;ll find that you need
a homeopathic remedy of a different, what they call potency or
strength, and then you take that. Sometimes it takes you three or
four days to chase this thing around and find out exactly what you
need, but eventually you&rsquo;ll get to an end point, and you won&rsquo;t
have that allergy. As far as I know, and we&rsquo;ve tested people
now for 28 years, nobody&rsquo;s ever had an allergy come back.

<br><br>


DW:  Wow.

<br><br>


PP:  And we&rsquo;re dealing
strictly with an informational system here that modern science
refuses to do. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem to make much difference to
those people who had allergies and don&rsquo;t, that modern science
doesn&rsquo;t like it. It doesn&rsquo;t fit their paradigm, which is
wrong.

<br><br>


BR:  I just want to say, on camera
here, that what we are very clear about, having spent quite some time
talking with you, that you&rsquo;re not trying to get rich through
any of this. You want to make this technology available.

<br><br>


PP:  No, I don&rsquo;t. No, I have
no need to make any money. The only reason I want to build the things
is so they&rsquo;re built right, and they moo like a cow [laughter] &ndash;
a dying cow. Because that gives it... that lets the doctor do the
treatment for much less, or the diagnoses for much less money.


<br><br>


And remember, the doctor only uses
this to help him in making his diagnoses. The diagnoses can&rsquo;t
be made by a machine, only made by a doctor.

<br><br>


BR:  Yeah.

<br><br>


PP:  That&rsquo;s
why in the beginning, we only sold them to card-carrying AMA,
card-carrying MDs. Then we sold a few to chiropractors. We sold a few
of them to osteopaths, a few of them to naturopaths.


<br><br>


Then, the
first person to have one that was a veterinarian was the Veterinary
Commissioner for the State of Nevada, and she started using them.
Then we have now... I quit keeping track when I started trying to
keep in front of these people and keep them out of trouble for using
them. And we&rsquo;ve not had any trouble in using them, because we
kept them out of trouble.

<br><br>


Anyway, at the time &ndash; all this
was maybe 18 years ago &ndash; there were about 350 veterinarians
using them and they were working perfectly. They could find out what
problems animals had, and how to solve the problem.

<br><br>


BR:  Folks, we&rsquo;re coming to
the end of our third hour and there may be a number of other topics
which we want to touch on before, well, while we have the
opportunity. I know there are a number of other topics. I&rsquo;ve
had my share of the cherry. David, is there more things you&rsquo;d
like to pick up on? I know that Kerry&rsquo;s got some questions too.

<br><br>


DW:  Yeah. I&rsquo;m just sensitive
to all the emails that are going to be coming in. People are going to
want to know how to buy these little plates, so if you say you can
machine them, once you&rsquo;re ready to do that, can you give us the
information?

<br><br>


PP:  If I had orders, I could
probably ship within two weeks.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  I can&rsquo;t tell you what
they cost. I know that one of the plates out of necessity needs to be
copper. I know that one of the plates, the factory that used to make
my electric material has gone out of business.

<br><br>


DW:  Hm.

<br><br>


PP:  So,
either I&rsquo;ll have to make it or find a factory that does it. But
we have tooling that fits in a machine called the Amada Punch Press
that punches it out faster than you can even see, and then it just
has to be tumbled in the right combination of things to make it
smooth and easy to handle, so it doesn&rsquo;t have sharp edges on
it.

<br><br>


DW:  But it&rsquo;s not that
expensive, is the bottom line.

<br><br>


PP:  It&rsquo;s not really that
expensive. The copper in it now costs about $7.00 or $8.00 dollars
for the copper plate, and probably much the same for the electric
plate. Then we have to stamp it and process it. It comes normally in
a little carrying case with a separation between the two.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  And a little set of cards that
you can fold out that shows all the points on the hand, all the
points on the feet. So there are pressure points where there are
things that you deal with; indigestion and headaches and that kind of
thing.

<br><br>


DW:  Well you
have your first order right now. [video displays
<U><A CLASS="western" HREF="mailto:dr_peterson_orders@projectcamelot.org">dr_peterson_orders@projectcamelot.org</A></U>
at the bottom]

<br><br>


PP:  [laughs] Yeah. I&rsquo;ve taken
them to, oh, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe a couple hundred health fairs
and Psychotronic Association meetings, the Global Science Congress
and Tesla Society meetings and dowsing meetings and so forth, and
I&rsquo;ve never taken them... I started with taking 20, and then I&rsquo;d
take 50, and then I&rsquo;d take 100, and I&rsquo;ve never found the
time that I didn&rsquo;t sell out before noon...

<br><br>


DW:  Right.

<br><br>


PP:  ...on the
first day. Once I sell three or four, then everybody is... people
can&rsquo;t put it down. So they&rsquo;re standing there doing it,
people [saying]: <I>Well,
where&rsquo;d you get that? What does that do?</I>

<br><br>


And the guy
is: <I>Here,
let me try it.</I>

<br><br>


<I>No. I don&rsquo;t
have a shoelace</I>.
Then I&rsquo;d start giving a shoelace with them so they&rsquo;d get
them back.


<br><br>


So, anyway, people like the way it
makes them feel, they like the way it makes their hands feel, and
they determine by themselves without any help from the government
that they actually do something for them that they like and so they
buy them.

<br><br>


DW:  Hm. Well, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s
really important to note that the healing is within. We all have this
power to heal ourselves.

<br><br>


PP:  Like I said, in any medical
device that I&rsquo;ve ever done... And I&rsquo;ve also, by having
the machine as a bio-feedback tool, I found a number of substances
that do miraculous things for the body.

<br><br>


DW:  Such as?

<br><br>


PP:  Out of
all those substances, and all the machines, the best thing I ever did
was the plates; they&rsquo;re not expensive. What I tell people is:
<I>If
you think about this right, you can just throw the plates away...</I>

<br><br>


<I>...</I>which
brings up another device that I&rsquo;ll be putting out that looks
like a cigarette pack &ndash; that&rsquo;s a bad thing to use &ndash;
like a pack of playing cards, and maybe that&rsquo;s even bad to use.
But it&rsquo;s a little device that has a headband that you have a
little electrode you soak with salt water in the front and the rear,
and it...


<br><br>


DW:  Salt water?

<br><br>


PP:  Salt
water, just regular salt water, table salt. You put that on and it
makes a tone, and we give a little cassette tape that makes a tone,
and you can learn to, with your brain, you can learn to match. It&rsquo;s
like if I hum or whistle <I>Yankee
Doodle</I>
ten times, you can hum <I>Yankee
Doodle</I>.
And if I do<I>
Mary Had a Little Lamb,</I>
you can do <I>Mary
Had a Little Lamb</I>.
This makes a sound and you learn to generate that sound by holding
your tongue right. Have you ever seen a watchmaker work?

<br><br>


DW:  The position of your tongue
changes the tone?

<br><br>


PP:  No, no, that&rsquo;s what I
didn&rsquo;t want to say.

<br><br>


DW:  Oh.

<br><br>


PP:  If you watch someone that&rsquo;s
doing precision work, like an engraver or a watchmaker, they do it
this way. [sticks his tongue out the side of his mouth]

<br><br>


DW:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  Yes, they have to hold their
tongue in a certain way and it lets them do things. But you don&rsquo;t
necessarily have to hold your tongue right, you learn how to hold
your mind right.

<br><br>


DW:  So this gives off an even
pitch? But the pitch is varying?

<br><br>


PP:  No. It&rsquo;s not an even
pitch. It&rsquo;s a varying pitch. It sounds like whistling a tune.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  So you
learn to make that tune by thinking right, and eventually you&rsquo;ll
put it on and if you do different things mentally, you&rsquo;ll get
different tones. So, you learn to hold those tones, so you get the
tone that was on the little tape. And when you get to that point, you
can then alter these things without the plates. You can just do it
mentally.

<br><br>


DW:  This is going to make me sound
stupid, but people in the audience are going to compare that the
Monroe tapes, with the binaural synchronization in the ears.

<br><br>


PP:  Yeah.

<br><br>


DW:  Is there any relationship with
those?

<br><br>


PP:  None whatsoever.

<br><br>


DW:  I didn&rsquo;t think so. Is
this like an EKG, like it&rsquo;s a brain wave?

<br><br>


PP:  No, no.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay. What&rsquo;s making the
tone?

<br><br>


PP:  An electrical field that&rsquo;s
generated by the body.

<br><br>


DW:  So, why these two points then?
[touching his forehead and center back of his head]

<br><br>


PP:  Because those are the ones that
work. [laughter]

<br><br>


DW:  Okay. So,
is it used only for healing? Or are there other...

<br><br>


PP:  My
favorite thing to do with it is find somebody that&rsquo;s into
brainwave analysis and brainwave work, and go have them implement me,
and then play <I>Yankee
Doodle</I>
for them with my brain. They immediately say: <I>Oops,
the machine is broken. We&rsquo;ve got to fix it, b</I><I>ecause
nobody can learn to do that.</I>
Sorry, I can teach anybody to play <I>Yankee
Doodle</I>
with their brain in two weeks.

<br><br>


DW:  But, I mean, are there...


<br><br>


PP:  And, once
you learn to do <I>Yankee
Doodle,</I>
you can do <I>Mary
Had a Little Lamb</I>
in about ten minutes.

<br><br>


DW:  Let&rsquo;s
say you have a guy that can move things with his mind; he has
telekinesis.

<br><br>


PP:  Yeah.

<br><br>


DW:  And he makes a song on this
thing.

<br><br>


PP:  He makes a song, and you buy
the song from him, like buying an mp3 thing, and you make that
song... chances are very good that you&rsquo;re going to run that
little ball bearing around through the maze with your head.

<br><br>


DW:  Really?

<br><br>


PP:  Yeah.

<br><br>


DW:  That&rsquo;s very interesting.

<br><br>


PP:  [speaking quietly] I can tell
you that government agencies have bought those by the thousands.

<br><br>


DW:  How would you get an electrode
on the back of your head? Isn&rsquo;t that going to go through your
hair?

<br><br>


PP:  Well, surplus-wise, I bought
about 10,000 little fold-out razors that are used to scrape hair off
the body when a surgeon needs to sew it up. You just put a little
shaving cream on it and scrape a little piece off and...


<br><br>


DW:  And there&rsquo;s a headband
you wear?

<br><br>


PP:  There&rsquo;s
a headband you wear, and there&rsquo;s two little electrodes made out
of a special metal, and they have a little cotton sock over them. You
soak this; you take water and you put it in a little bowl, and you
stir water and salt together until there&rsquo;s no more salt to
dissolve, and you dip those in there and squeeze them out a little
bit. Use a little wash cloth with some soap on it and wipe the grease
off the area here [pointing to his forehead] and the grease off the
area back here that you&rsquo;ve <I>balded.</I>
You put it on, and it works just fine.

<br><br>


DW:  Wow. How precise do you have to
be in placement? Does it have to be right smack on?

<br><br>


PP:  No, within a couple inches.

<br><br>


DW:  Oh.

<br><br>


PP:  No, it
doesn&rsquo;t go on the <I>third
eye</I>.
A lot of your people will ask that. It goes in a different spot.

<br><br>


DW:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  But it&rsquo;s
very easy to tell where it goes because you put it on and it isn&rsquo;t
making... we&rsquo;ll call it <I>brainwave
noise</I>.
That&rsquo;s not what it is, but then anything that isn&rsquo;t
hooked directly to the brain isn&rsquo;t brainwave noise anyway.

<br><br>


BR:  I have a 60-second question
before this tape goes out. Why would the agencies be interested in
stuff like this?

<br><br>


PP:  Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that I
can say that.

<br><br>


BR:  Okay. We&rsquo;ll leave it to
our imagination.

<br><br>


PP:  Leave it to your imagination.


<br><br>


BR:  Okay.

<br><br>


PP:  I can
tell you that there were a lot of them bought at SRI. [Ed. note:
Stanford Research Institute]

<br><br>


BR:  Uh-huh.

<br><br>


PP:  And a lot
of them were bought by...

<br><br>


KC:  To teach remote influencing.

<br><br>


[music begins to fade in]

<br><br>


PP:  I didn&rsquo;t say that. I
didn&rsquo;t even hint that.

<br><br>


KC:  I said that.

<br><br>


PP:  I wouldn&rsquo;t do that if I
were you.

<br><br>


KC:  Oh.

<br><br>


PP:  Not
unless you&rsquo;d like a visit. You <I>will</I>
have a visit if you mention it. And you <I>won&rsquo;t</I>
like it.


<br><br>


[fade out]

<br><br>


Music plays
over PP&rsquo;s voice saying: <I>...been
involved with trying to build flying saucers, you usually found with
flying saucers, if you look at most of the movies, there always seems
to be a robot involved with it...</I>
