What's the best place to start as far as Stargates go? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dan: Well, I've got a list of questions here in front of me, submitted by you two, all 30 of them.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: [laughs]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned the number.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: No, no ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: They are decommissioned. They are separated into their three components: there's a projection component, a ring component, and also a barrel component to both the Stargate devices as well as the Looking Glass device. The Stargates also have field posts, and again I'm not a physicist so I wouldn't be the appropriate one to make comment as to how they work.<br>      <br>    But there were field posts that were positioned around the actual &ldquo;gates&rdquo; and they have been stored, I guess. I'm not certain what happened to the field components. But the three components have actually been decommissioned and liasioned to the European Union, the United Nations, and NATO, who are actually in possession of them. And there is no one group which has the other one of the other two components. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK, so ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: So everybody is staring at everybody and they're not ... They can't put the equipment together because everybody is mutually dependent and looking questioningly at everybody else. So everybody is literally protecting everybody else. Of the actual base operating equipment, there are three components to it, which is a projection device of some sort, a barrel, and a set of rings, electromagnetic rings.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Are we able to know how many man-made Stargates there were on the planet?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: No. I'm not going to comment as to the total. I will say that there was over 50.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Really! </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yep.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow. In different countries of the world.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. And these are man-made?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So, and now these Stargates ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well, see, it's not a <em>Stargate</em>. It's a device which accesses </font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a portal, a wormhole.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Does it access a natural ... In other words, the manmade device accesses a natural Stargate.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes. It draws off from a natural ERB, an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: It accesses it and somehow works, from what I understand, not in parallel, but almost like piggybacks, on the energy of the natural Stargate, yeah.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So, in other words, if there were only ... If there were 50 man-made devices accessing, they would be accessing a corresponding 50 natural energy vortexes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That I don't know.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: There is a possibility that ... In fact when the Looking Glass was operated, they were usually worked in tandem. It required a second Looking Glass to be turned on at the same time to get acoustics through. So unless a second one was turned on ...which operated at one other place, where Will Uhouse had been. He saw the second node location, as opposed to the first node being over at the Papoose facility.<br>      <br>    Two pieces of equipment, two Looking Glasses, were required to be turned on at the same time to be able to hear acoustics or sound, if you will, from whatever the people were watching, to piggyback in tandem with the visual response of the equipment. That it required two to be turned on to hear anything.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And then both sides could hear the same thing. So I suppose, both of the Looking Glasses being tuned to the same thing was accessing the same &ldquo;tunnel,&rdquo; if you will, to the information.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK, that's what I was wondering. So the Looking Glass has an ability to show one the future but a Stargate, or, you know, equipment that accesses a Stargate, or a wormhole, is for time travel? Right? We're talking about two different things?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Are they using the same technology? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Essentially, yes. The original device was the Stargate device. That was then increased in power, if you will, with the use of these field posts. How it bumped up the power, how it stabilized it, I don't know. You'd need to speak with a physicist about that.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: However ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: It increased it enough to where that it <em>became</em> a Looking Glass?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well, no. No. No. It would be pumped up in power to stabilize the &ldquo;doorway,&rdquo; if you will, to step through into another location, which in essence, because distance and time are relative, the same thing - step through into another time. The Looking Glass device is a back-engineered Stargate.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: So it was actually back-engineered from the original cylinder-seal data which allowed us to produce the Stargate access devices, if you will, what we call the Stargates.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Uh huh. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: It's a back-engineered device, the Looking Glass is. So the Looking Glass is a secondary device and it was coming into its fore in the 60s and 70s and Will saw one of the first generations of it, from what I understand, a very large piece of equipment. They always get smaller, no matter what. Look at what's happened to the computer.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Who? Will saw? </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh yeah. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Will ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Will Uhouse.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ... Uhouse saw the original Looking Glass.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: He saw one of the original Looking Glasses demonstrated. And in fact it's going to be in the DVD that we're getting ready to put out, the actual interview, where he was indicating the firing of a bullet, I believe it was, through an object, and there was a time delay where the bullet actually passed through the object where you saw the bullet <em>past</em> the object, or the projectile if you will, a rail gun, I believe. What was the ... [Marci McDowell, off screen, confirms this]. Yeah, it was a rail gun being used. And then afterward they saw the impact of the device. So they were already playing with it in the early 70s, early to mid 70s, dealing with time sequences.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wasn't the original Looking Glass back-engineered from alien technology?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: [long pause] Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But there was also information around the cylinder-seals ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Um hmm....</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ...that they used also and that those cylinder-seals also came from an off world race.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: From ... Well, no, the cylinder seals didn't. The information <em>on</em> them did.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Which was maybe the Anunnaki? Is that ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I wouldn't feel comfortable in characterizing it with that name.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I really shouldn't. No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But it was off world technology. Originally.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes ma'am.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. And at this point, like ... OK. Say that was in the 60s? the 50s?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well ... Yes. That's when they started actually showing a lot of interest in actually building the equipment to be able to see over the curvature of time-space so that they could see into the future and somewhat into the past, but basically the future.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So there's also our Henry Deacon contacts that deal with the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; that came on one of the craft.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Uh huh. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And I don't know if you're familiar with that black box.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Uh huh.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Did you have exposure to that as well?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yeah. It was something that we called the Cube or the Yellow Disc. Yeah. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But that was not ... Was that a Looking Glass?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That is a variant of the technology.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: However, while the Looking Glass shows probabilities, or has shown probabilities, the Cube would react with the people present, so there was an alteration, if you will, over what you were seeing from it. It would actually spin out as a yellow disc out of the top of it ... where the word &ldquo;Yellow Book&rdquo; originally came from.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Yeah. OK. Yeah.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And, depending upon what predisposition ... Kind of like little Yoda telling young Luke, &ldquo;<em>Bring in there what you have with you</em>.&rdquo; You know, whatever's there is what you bring. You could then change the perspective, the &ldquo;tilt,&rdquo; if you will, the orientation or angle, of the information being presented back to you. So, unless you were well prepared to deal with such a thing, human interaction and human emotions bring instability of the provenance of the information. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. That's what went on with the black boxes, then.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But with the Looking Glass...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And actually I used that to our advantage at the T-9, because that in fact was present at the T-9 and I projected certain information which caused a little upset during the meeting, and they got certain abductions removed and Lotus removed off the calendar, and things like that. I caused some real trouble, in other words.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Can you elaborate? Are you willing to elaborate?</font></p><p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well. The...the... Let me sit here and consider what I should and should not ...<br>    <br>  During the negotiations for the Tau 9-6, I was asked to supply a model for the Lotus. In fact, Marcia and I were both asked because they knew tangentially she was involved. I agreed to do so, which is what you respond when you are a sworn operative. It's &ldquo;<em>Yes</em>,&rdquo; unless there are great, great objections. I was then taken to the location where the treaty was actually being negotiated. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To give a short recitation as to the nature of Lotus: What was happening is the P-45ks used Lotus. They wanted to use Lotus for the back-engineering of their own neurological problem. I was objecting to its use, but still to provide .... was under orders to provide a model. I was prepared to do so but I was also allowed to show them probable outcomes. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So in fact the Yellow Book, the Cube, was used for that purpose. Shockingly, they happened to see themselves standing on the bones of their own families and things like that in the vision and they ultimately decided to remove Lotus as well as certain abductions from the Tau 9 treaty. So we were successful in getting certain things removed I think I can safely mention at this time, because we're only one OF 9 and one Tau 9 treaty away from the passage through the... the completion of the passage through the galactic plane. So I think I'm pretty well safe to go ahead and mention it now. They're not going to be able to get it back and put on the treaties and all of that in the time we have left. In other words, they got out-foxed, and ... that's what happens when you're negotiating treaties.</font></p>    <BLOCKQUOTE>      <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#330099">Note to the transcript from Marci McDowell:</font></font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font color="#330099" size="3"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OF-9: Dan is referring to the &quot;Omicron Phi 9&quot; Treaty System, the Treaty System not involving the P-45ks, and the &quot;Tau 9&quot; or &quot;T9&quot; Treaty System involving all parties including the P-45ks. &nbsp;He is precisely speaking about the &quot;Omicron Phi 9-8&quot; Treaty gathering scheduled for 2009, and the &quot;Tau 9-7&quot; FINAL Treaty gathering scheduled for 2012.</font></font></p>      </blockquote>    </BLOCKQUOTE>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So you used the capacity of the Yellow Book or little black box to show them the future implications ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Exactly.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ... of what using the Lotus to amplify, or to rectify, their own biological problem?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: This is true. And that was skewed by ... It takes a great deal of emotion to skew the imagery and the audio that comes with it. But I'll just say that I am extremely vehement with regard to my objection for Lotus being used, and apparently that vehemence was sufficient to skew the image enough to get them to jump back aghast in horror. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Wow. So... OK. And this, kind of like just for the sake of the audience to some degree ... You have seen in, I guess the Yellow Book or in the Looking Glass (and you can correct me on which one it is), the future of Lotus, in effect, how Lotus becomes ...You know, once it's brought to the fore by you ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well, actually, no. No, no, I haven't. I haven't. The reports to me which came concerning the future of Lotus, which we're not going to get into in depth this evening, ah.... was given to me as information.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So you didn't see it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Personally see it? No. I was told. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: I see.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I was told. That was during the early years. I say the &ldquo;early years&rdquo; of Lotus. It's only been going on for 6 years now.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: But this was the latter half of 2001 and this was a <em>quid pro quo</em> for them to get certain information from ... that Chi'el'ah showed me. I demanded certain information back, and it actually was information concerning the time travel issue, because they were still trying to be ... You know, they were still reticent about informing me as to what the real nature of the situation was as late as 2001. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Meaning, the real situation was ... Meaning how much access to Stargates, to time travel that they actually had?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Right. The whole treaty system, the situations involving the treaties, their outcomes, the actual potential for both Timeline #1 and Timeline #2 outcomes. In the case that we're in right now, we seem to be on a variant of Timeline #1, and that's good. For everything that I've seen and have read and have had reported to me concerning Timeline #1, it's not happening exactly the way that they figured that it would. But then again, it couldn't because we've made changes along the way which diverted us away from Timeline #2 and in so doing, our future ...<br>      <br>    Again, I regard our future as something which is pretty much a blank slate. We're writing it for ourselves. And so we are now seeing something coming to pass which is slightly different than the prognostication in the probabilities that we were seeing. And I'm good with what we're seeing so far but, you know, we are still faced with the challenges, the environmental degradation, etc. But hopefully we will rise to the challenge.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So this is interesting because it sounds like Chi'el'ah was instrumental in getting you to have greater access to intelligence about what the Looking Glass and MJ12 ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well, it was information that he was providing me which provoked the questions.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Yeah</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And the fact that they didn't even want to get into longwinded discussions with me in the late 90s concerning <em>what</em> he even was. After we had argued for years to find out even where the material was coming from, then we were finally given access to the material. I mean, this went on for a few years. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But your interaction with Chi'el'ah was leading you one way and giving you one set of information and MJ-12 then had another set. Isn't that right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well, they weren't ... They weren't really ... It wasn't that they had another set of information. He was telling me ... He did tell me basically what was going on.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And they were simply not providing that information as what they considered a need-to-know situation.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: I see. So ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: They just weren't going to tell me what they didn't feel I needed to know.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But little did they ... Well, this is <em>my</em> paraphrase, but little did they know that Chi'el'ah was basically clueing you in.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: He was clueing me in and he was informing me his perspectives concerning the treaties. I knew something was going on and that is ultimately what they wanted to know about and I said, &ldquo;<em>Well, for you to know about that kind of thing, then I need to know about certain other things</em>.&rdquo; You know, it was truly a <em>quid pro quo</em> situation and they said, &ldquo;<em>Well OK. We'll tell you if you tell us</em>.&rdquo; So I told them and they told me a little more.<br>      <br>    And it was right around that same time that Lotus was actually kicking into fore, the May 31st, 2001 event that took my prosaic project and basically threw it in the garbage can and it turned into what it is now, this project that it is now. And as a result I also found out from them where they said Lotus was ultimately destined. And that is, like I said, we'll discuss that at a slightly future date.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But it isn't it true to some extent that Lotus could help Chi'el'ah now?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That was the perspective of the P-45 J-Rods, and that is not my perspective.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: I see. So ... because I make a distinction between Chi'el'ah, who is, from what I understand, a P-52, and the P-45s. So, but they're on the same ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: They're on the same timeline, the same track, but just separated by 7,000 years.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So, even so ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Which is quite a big separation.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So what we get ...what you're saying is that, in a sense, Chi'el'ah couldn't get the benefit of Lotus because ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Nor did he ask for it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Nor did he ask for it. And I will say this. This is something that David ... I spoke with David on the phone not that long ago. I'll leave the last name off. I think you know who I'm ....</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Sure, but we can use his name if it's OK with you.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well sure. David Wilcock. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. Yeah, because we taped an interview with him.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh, OK. Wonderful. And he was talking. We were discussing the same thing, which was the Box, the Cube. And I said, &ldquo;<em>Yeah, but a strange thing happened</em>.&rdquo; I was <em>pro temp</em> or made MJ-9 for the 12 as the result of a bet that went on within MJ-12. And I got a chance to tap who ended up being the last MJ-9 prior to the adjournment.<br>      <br>    Before tapping her, who was the first female to ever set in the 12, I got a chance to look at certain documents and look through certain archives in Washington, DC prior to going across to the continent and meeting with some folks and telling them basically I wasn't interested in their offers. I'm talking about a trip to Brussels.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: To see the lluminati?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yeah. And during the same time, the Cube disappeared. And it hasn't been seen since. And it disappeared out of the archives. Of course I have no idea ... I have no idea where the item may be, but I do know this: I'm <em>happy</em> that they can't find it. Because what they were doing is they were handing this Cube around ...<br>      <br>    And this was a question that Bill had asked, whether there was only one Cube. They were handing this Cube around from country to country, to the elitists in the countries, to look into their own futures so that they could pick the best paths for themselves. Why don't they just live their lives? And try to be good people?&nbsp; Why do they need a little black box to tell them when to jump and how to jump? That's not being fully human, at least from my perspective and those of our associates. That's not being fully human. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, as I understand, it disappeared. Now, there have been certain, you know, allegations, that have been made that during the time when I had... Is it almost a year ago now? When I had the bad seizure? It was near the end of last year, was it? No. [Marcia, off screen, confirming date] It was about a year ago and I had a very severe seizure and was actually put out of commission, seriously, for a while, and there was a big hullabaloo to get over to my apartment to get something out of my apartment. What that object was, I won't comment. But I will say this to everybody: Whoever took it, it's in safe hands and it won't be used to harm humanity.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: All right.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: In fact, the fact that it's in safe hands will prevent it from being used to harm humanity. It has been thus far only used ... Aside from ... Well, I mean, I've got to try to justify my own behavior in Bandelier in using it for the purposes of skewing to get Lotus off and the abductions off.

Yes. <em>Bill</em> was the builder of the avionics and the testing equipment who back-engineered ARV testing equipment and avionics. I actually saw some of the equipment (and this is in the tape that Marcia and I did) ... in a room. &nbsp;I actually saw some of the equipment, some of the diagnostic equipment, in the B-bay, underneath the Galileo bay, that he actually built.

So in 1947, when the Cube was discovered, it must have really screwed up the idea of the two timelines by bringing in the ability to ... I mean, I don't know what the two can and can't do ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well, first of all, the Cube actually was not discovered in 1947. There's a mixture of the stories involved. The Cube was actually ... The information about the Cube and its existence was known as of 1946. It was further discussed in 1947 after a certain crash in a Midwestern, lower, Southwestern state, New Mexico, and following which, during the first brokering for treaties by the Orions with Eisenhower, the Cube was handed to Eisenhower. It was in fact expected to go to the United Nations authorities and it was in fact spirited away by the United States military.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: They didn't hand it over.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: But the way you're talking about the Cube is that it sounds like it connects emotionally with the viewer, in a sense.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: It does.

It was actually Orion technology.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And it was handed over by them in a spirit of goodwill but a mis-assessment as to our evolutionary state, our ability to handle the issue.

Well this opens almost Pandora's Box in the sense of United States history.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That <em>is</em> Pandora's Box. Yes. I'm not exactly certain what was seen relative to Cube for 911. However, the analysis which I was asked to do ... (of course I paid the price of having actually done it. Again, people don't want to hear the answers that I came up with.) But ... the analysis that I did indicated that certainly there is, at minimum, a great suspicion concerning the delay of response. And information that I have directly from one of the formerly seated members was in fact that we were <em>aware</em> (but this was Looking Glass technology, not the Cube) ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: I understand.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That we were aware as of the middle 1990s that there would be a coming Islamic extremist war with the United States. We were also aware of certain alternative situations that they used the statistics from the Looking Glass for the variability between the different pictures to show that would be occurring at the same time, the other probability at the same time. And, from their perspective, that the least of the two consequences was 9/11. I am aware of what the other possible consequence was. I'm not willing to come out and start mentioning it because I don't know what the consequences are of speaking of things that have not thus far happened, yet the probabilities existed that they <em>could</em>.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Yeah.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: So, you know, I'm feeling a little bit ... There's a little weight when it comes to that, but ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. You're saying though, that the Looking Glasses have been, as you called it, decommissioned.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes, ma'am.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And that means across the board.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Across the board.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: They are shut down.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And you said there was 50 man-made devices. And I'm assuming ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I said at least 50.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ... that would access, or create, Stargates out of natural vortexes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes. They would suck them in and make them available.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: And a Looking Glass is not the same as a Stargate.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: No. A Looking Glass is a back-engineered form from the original cylinder-seal descriptions on how to build the units that made Stargates, so that ... in essence y ou could take a Looking Glass unit and make a couple changes to the equipment, l ift it up on an angle</font>, <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">put field posts around it and open up a hole to step through.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Sure. OK, but the Looking Glass can show you the future. So are we saying ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Future probabilities. Not the future.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So are we saying there were 50 Looking Glasses in operation as well as ...?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Oh no. There were much less. We had a basic monopoly over the Looking Glass. That and India. India brokered early on with Indira when Indira Gandhi was brokering the Committee of the Majority between the United States and the Soviet Union because the Soviets were threatening to start their own treaty system up with the extra terrestrials, which would have become untenable.<br>      <br>    We agreed then to expand MJ-12 from a wholly operated and owned American operation to an international operation. Thus was born the Committee of the Majority between 1963 and 1967. And when that information was brokered, that happened in parallel with, kind of under the table but in parallel with the United Nations treaties involving things like the test ban treaty and the outer space treaty. <br>    <br>    And so it was being done at the same time under cover of UN support. The diplomats were going back and forth and brokering the opening up, so that the treaty system would be a single treaty system and thus tenable and manageable, to, hopefully, a good outcome. And we'll be knowing within the next few years whether that was successful.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So this is really fascinating. You're saying that some other countries, India for one, had access to Looking Glass technology.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes, ma'am. They had that written in as far back as the 1960s and 1970s when it was actually being back-engineered from the Stargate material. And  so at the same time that Will Uhouse, for instance, was looking at the early generation Looking Glass, India had the same.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. And are you at liberty to say what other countries had access to that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: To the information? Or to the equipment?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: To the Looking Glass, to <em>a</em> Looking Glass, or the ability ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ... to create a Looking Glass and look back ... look at time, look forward into their own history ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: No. No. </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Was that not acceptable?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: No. No. And I'll tell you why the answer is no. Within the treaties, the Looking Glass as well as the Stargates, as well as the Cube, and the &ldquo;information movement pods,&rdquo; are all contained within the treaty system. Within that treaty system it also prohibits and allows certain passage of information amongst delegates on where the Looking Glass material is and where the information flow is, what the access is. Being that I stood in Bandelier and considered a delegate, therefore I cannot tell you.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So you can't tell me who has ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ... access to that technology.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Aside from India and the United States. No.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. Right. But we can assume that some countries perhaps, that is, the leadership of some countries, may have had access to this technology at some point.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I think that it's fair to say that we can assume that they had access to the information from it. But I wouldn't place any characterization over any assumption of who may or may not have had it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. All right, well, I think ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: I thank you for the question, though.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But it also gives you a whole different way of looking at history. I mean, certainly ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Indeed it does.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: I mean... You know, this stuff has got to be kind of as natural to you as, you know, getting up in the morning, you know, and having a cup of coffee. This is all part of your world view.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Nah ...There is nothing as natural to me as getting up and having my cup of coffee! [big laugh]</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And we should have never built... The Stargate, yes, OK, for the purpose of speaking with the visitors from the other timelines. Yes, absolutely. But Looking Glass, no. That was done because of our own shortcomings as people who aspire to things that we maybe shouldn't try to grab ahold of.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Well ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: It should never have been built.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: It gives you power, right? We're talking about power, and the misuse of power here.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: I mean, bottom line, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: So ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And I am an advocate against that misuse. In fact ... Well, I could say against the misuse ... I am against its <em>use</em>. Period.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So let's say one has the Looking Glass, and you're saying it shows probabilities, and one of the things we were wondering is: How does it do that?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Well, from the best I understand (and I was speaking with Bill just a little while about it, a little while ago), the rings and the amount of information via energy which is passed into it. And I've got to be <em>very</em> careful with this ...The position of the rings, their orientation, the energy running through them, the position of the barrel, etc - because you can raise the barrel up on an armature inside the center of it &ndash; all come into play as if you have an onion with the various layers of the onion.<br>      <br>    As you move through the different energy levels you also move through the different layers so you get different bits of information. Now, imagine an almost infinite number of layers overlaying in comparison to the positions of the rings and an almost infinite amount of energy that you can add or subtract, tuning it up, tuning it down.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Well, it sounds sort of like ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Instead of going up by 1 hertz or 2 hertz, maybe by a thousandth of a hertz up and down.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. But it sounds like you're working with ... almost like a kaleidoscope effect. You know, like a kaleidoscope, a real kaleidoscope, the way you would turn and twist and focus and each time you get a different design. Right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Right, except ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: The design and the colors change.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: You get a different design and the colors change but it's like working with multiple kaleidoscopes where, when you find two different probabilities that you would run into, you have two kaleidoscopes and you make a change on one kaleidoscope that may factor or function to a different angular change on another kaleidoscope. So you get two separate pictures that you then have that are flashing back and forth.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: But yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. So, is ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That's the best analogy I can ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Is there an interface with a computer to get these read-outs ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ... of the probabilities?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Yes. In fact there's a de-interlacing system which they used to actually de-interlace the flashing back and forth of the two probabilities or the multiples that they had at certain times when it starts skipping ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: You could freeze them, right? So you could look at them closer?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: What they did is that they de-interlaced the video and then reintegrated the video and watched the individual videos and then determined statistically how much time was spent on each video to determine the amount of probability of each event occurring. And they tested that against probabilities in the field and probabilities of future occurrence to get a system which functioned scientifically. And that's ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK. And so, well, I'm going to go with that and I'm going to actually say that what they might have been doing is then looking <em>back</em> to see ... In other words, if they saw an event in the Looking Glass, all they had to do was calibrate, or look at the different possibilities to see which one happened and then ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: That's what they did.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: ... as time went on ...</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: Absolutely. That's right on it. That's right on. That's right on the beam. And you know, some people like to say ... Some people say it's blue smoke and mirrors, but, then again, I was told something in 2001 that I'm living in right now. OK?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: OK? Without going to what it is. And, like I said, we'll talk about that in the future. But it's the best scientific equipment that I can <em>imagine</em> for the determining of such a thing. But it goes to the old question: Just because we have the power to do something, should we?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Sure</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And I am a 100% advocate. She and I [gesturing toward Marcia] had a more than a small dustup out at Frenchman Mountain over this very same thing, which actually resulted in me walking alone down Lake Mead back toward Las Vegas, with she and I yelling and screaming at each other along the roadside.<br>      <br>    They were doing tests out at Frenchman Mountain during the time that the Rosen Bridge was being accessed there - the Einstein-Rosen Bridge - with the equipment. They had the curtains up and all of that business, enough where Metro couldn't see it from the top of the mountain and all that. And they were accessing there and there was a mistake and a small explosion out there on the east side of this little ... what we call the Conquistador Helmet.</font></p>    <blockquote>      <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#330099">Note to the transcript from Marci McDowell:</font></font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font size="3"><font color="#330099" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Metro&quot;, referring to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.</font></font></p>      </blockquote>    </blockquote>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And she wanted me to go out there with her to help clean some the evidence up of it.

But I don't believe in playing with things which actually deal with looking into the future.<br>    <br>    There's another issue that was going on at the time, in fact, the variety of communication which was going on via this equipment ...from <em>elsewhere</em> ... I presume ... she won't, still hasn't, won't admit to me, but I presume that it was from Orion and it was information, defense related information, on how this type of equipment, how an Einstein-Rosen Bridge at a distance, could be used to pull information out of a defense computer system.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: Ah ha</font>.</p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D: And I don't mean a U.S. defense computer system. I said, &ldquo;<em>You know what? NO</em>.&rdquo; Look, we've got the technology here. We've got the talent. We've got the willpower and we've got the willingness to defend our own country without the use of something involving time technology. I wouldn't want to go up against, for instance, god help us, the Chinese, on the ground. But at the same time, I don't fear their country either. I believe that we should be diplomatic with them and have a firm understanding and a respect for one another. But I also don't fear them.

And about the psychology of individuals who come to a table to play a game and who cheat to alter the outcome of the game. And that whole psychology is something which I'm not ... you know, is not foreign to me and so that helped, if you will, prime the wick of the explosion between myself and that variety of technology, which actually primed my disagreement with them.</font></p>    <BLOCKQUOTE>      <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#330099">Note to the transcript from Marci McDowell:</font></font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font size="3"><font color="#330099" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Eye&quot; is a reference to the 'Eye in the Sky' or 'Casino Surveillance'.</font></font></p>      </blockquote>    </BLOCKQUOTE>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K: OK.

That yes, the so-called cycle of catastrophe, or season of catastrophe of Fulcanelli, the time period from, oh, right around 1992 to right around 2012, right around that area. While we will have passed it, passed 2012, we really ought to get through the entire cycle which is about 1980 to about 2016, to feel confident that the interpretation from the timeline from the future about their own catastrophe is not off by a few years. We're talking about 45,000 years or 52,000 years respectively. We have difficulty understanding what happened 2,000 years ago and we're talking about 50,000 years here.

Yeah, they're decommissioned and the Stargates and the Looking Glasses, I'm sure they're all in their little mothball containers and all of that and they have been separated ... The three components of each have been separated and moved to different power structures, diplomatic and military authorities around the world. And we're talking about the EU specifically, the UN, and NATO. Those are in specific control of one of the three components each.
