How is your manic day going on at the conference?                  Let&rsquo;s see now. I guess you two had new travels. Where                  have you gone?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; Well, we were in Ecuador about a month ago working                  with Brian O&rsquo;Leary and George Green.

I know George quite well.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; And Brian O&rsquo;Leary, ex-NASA. He&rsquo;s a free                  energy activist. He&rsquo;s a very wonderful man and we were                  delighted to get to know him. And Ecuador is a very interesting                  place to be. Now we&rsquo;re in somewhere completely different                  at the Los Angeles Conscious Life Expo.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; Oh yeah. That&rsquo;s                good.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve                    been talking informally with David Icke and Jordan Maxwell                  and a number of other people who you know pretty well.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; I                    heard that David was down for the conference, too.

Today is Monday, the 16th of February, 2009.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So Bill                    Deagle, we&rsquo;re very interested in hearing what                  you have to say. I know you have an update for us, so go ahead.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BR:&nbsp; And,                  Bill, it was your birthday yesterday? Is that right?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:&nbsp; It                    was. And today is President&rsquo;s                  Day -- which is interesting. [laughter] Yeah. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The update,                    I guess, follows a talk last September [2008] and of course                    the call-back on October 4th regarding the dissolution of                    Iceland, which of course has got, probably, early membership                  in the European Union coming up. But what&rsquo;s going on                  is it&rsquo;s decaying to a kind of a state of chaos there.                  There&rsquo;s a number of nations where this is happening. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just got off of doing a show today with Joan Veon, Ted Pike,                  and of course Lindsey Williams, his contacts high in the oil                  field and the globalist organizations that are controlling                  things. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One thing                    I think people should realize is that what&rsquo;s                  coming is not a <em>recession</em>. It&rsquo;s not a <em>depression</em>.                  It&rsquo;s not even just an <em>economic dissolution</em> where                  we get the entire world economy to collapse.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s                    an <em>economic revolution,</em> which means that                  there probably is going to be some short, sharp, very severe                  pain, but they&rsquo;re gonna be changing the very whole nature                  of what the world economy is.&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what                    I believe, from all the research and also the intuitive side                    of what&rsquo;s going on, is we&rsquo;re going to be facing                  a number of things that fly in the face of logic and the latest                  in scientific research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example,                    this week I&rsquo;ll have on the show Dr. Peter                  Ward, a specialist in geology, volcanism, and air chemistry                  in terms of what&rsquo;s going on in the atmospheric chemistry,                  and his model, of course, using volcanism and sulphur dioxide,                  as well as the human production of SO2 as one of the major                  factors controlling the climate.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But they&rsquo;re                    going to proceed with a Carbon Tax at the same time they&rsquo;re                    probably going to put in jeopardy... 100-million                  souls are likely to die in the next year from starvation caused                  by us not dealing with the financial problems, and if there&rsquo;s                  a financial seizure, in a sense, where the entire world economy                  shuts down.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    is happening both in U.S. ports and elsewhere. It&rsquo;s                  called the Baltic Dry Index, which means that goods are not                  being shipped anywhere in the world. That means food, automobiles,                  everything shutting down. It actually shut down 87% over its                  average.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That means                    the international flow of goods, usually by ship and rail,                    around the world that are shipping from one country to another.                  And it means that things aren&rsquo;t being shipped.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, for                    instance, in Germany, they&rsquo;re stacking up on                  the docks. They don&rsquo;t have any place to put automobiles                  that are going to be shipped overseas. Goods in China &ndash; they&rsquo;re                  afraid of a deterioration in their whole society, so they continue                  to have the factories going, making products to be shipped                  overseas and they have no place to put them.

It&rsquo;s going to                  be extremely painful without anesthetic on the battlefield,                  with cautery and saws, etcetera.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s the thing that people need to grasp here,                  is this is not like anything we&rsquo;ve experienced before                  either, in the Great Depression of the 1930s. It&rsquo;s more                  in keeping with the collapse of the Lombardy System in the                  14th century that resulted in the Black Death. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it&rsquo;s even more than that, because what we&rsquo;re                  going to end up with out of it very quickly, is a whole new                  world economy where everything&rsquo;s in an electronic system,                  that they have absolute control over every citizen on Earth,                  including tracking and control.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going.

There&rsquo;s over two million volcanoes underneath,                  this belt of volcanoes at the bottom of the oceans.

We&rsquo;re all on the time cycles to go into                  another Ice Age. And it won&rsquo;t take a long period. It                  won&rsquo;t take decades or centuries.

At the same time, we&rsquo;re                  going to go through major Earth changes, including a pole shift.                  And it won&rsquo;t be just magnetic.
