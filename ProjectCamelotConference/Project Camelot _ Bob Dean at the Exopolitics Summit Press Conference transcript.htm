<br><br>

BOB
DEAN (BD): Ladies and gentlemen, let me express my deep appreciation
for your attendance here this afternoon. It&rsquo;s gratifying to me
to see such a turnout from the Spanish media.

<br><br>

In
my country you have to grab the media by the throat and drag them
kicking and screaming to pay attention to this subject. So I&rsquo;m
grateful and have much gratitude for your attendance here this
afternoon.

<br><br>

Let
me apologize to the beautiful translator / interpreter to my right.
[laughter] I am notorious for not following script or instructions.
So I will deviate somewhat from my prepared comments this afternoon,
and I will tell you essentially what I have seen, and what I have
learned, and what I have concluded about what I consider to be the
greatest story in the history of the human race.

<br><br>

It
is not merely the study of the history of
the
human race or in the history of the human race. It is really
essentially the study, the conclusion of
the
history of the human race.

<br><br>

Ladies
and gentlemen, we are not alone and we have never been alone.
[applause] We have had a history of an intimate interrelationship
with advanced extraterrestrial intelligence from the beginning of our
human history.

<br><br>

I
spent 27 years on active duty in the United States Army. I led combat
troops in Korea in 1951 in one of the bloodiest wars we&rsquo;ve ever
fought. I gathered intelligence in Southeast Asia in Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos in 1970.

<br><br>

But
in 1963 I received an assignment to the Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers in Europe. At that time this was considered to be a choice
and
plumb
assignment
in the United States Army. I was excited about the assignment. I took
my wife and my children to Paris, France. My children went to high
school in Paris and learned to speak fluent French. And I was given
an assignment to the Supreme Headquarters Operations Center, a place
we called &lsquo;SHOC&rsquo;.


<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
not trying to make a joke, but when I arrived, I was shocked at what
I learned. It appeared that an event occurred on the early morning of
the second of February, 1961, that almost started World War III.

<br><br>

Large
numbers of circular craft of some kind flew over Central Europe out
of the Soviet sector toward the west over NATO and Allied lines.
These objects were circular, metallic, flying at a very high
altitude, and flying at a very high rate of speed and they flew in
formation very obviously under intelligent control. They would
generally fly to the west and they would turn north over the English
Channel, the southern coast of England and disappear from NATO radar
over the Norwegian seas.

<br><br>

In
the early morning of February &rsquo;61, World War III almost began.
The Soviets went on red alert. All NATO forces went on red alert. Our
fingers were poised on the triggers and over those red buttons. And
the whole thing was over in about 20 minutes.
<br><br>

A
British Air Marshal by the name of Sir Thomas Pike decided to
initiate a study to find out what
the hell was going on here. They
conducted a three-year study. I arrived in the summer of 1963 and
learned that it was underway, and they published the study in 1964.

<br><br>

All
of us who worked in the war room and all of us who had a Cosmic Top
Secret clearance were shocked and stunned by what we read.

<br><br>

They
concluded that the human race and the planet Earth had been under
some kind of observation and study for a very long time. They --
whoever they were -- were deeply interested in us and had been
obviously observing us and studying us for a tremendous amount of
time, hundreds
--if
not thousands --
of years. The study concluded that if they had been hostile or
malevolent, there was absolutely nothing we could do. The study,
titled <I>An
Assessment</I>,
also
concluded that some kind of a program was underway. Even today we
still don&rsquo;t know what that program is all about.

<br><br>

Ladies
and Gentlemen, that was the beginning for me. I spent the last 45
years trying to determine what this is all about and what does it
mean. And I have concluded that this, indeed, is the greatest story
in human history. We are and have been members of, apparently, an
intergalactic culture and civilization and a community of intelligent
life.

<br><br>

We
are dealing with four particularly different races. They are all
humanoid, but one group is totally human just as we are. The
conclusions are that we are hybrids
-- <I>we
humans are hybrids.</I>
Our relationship with them is one of a fellowship and a brotherhood.
And they are assisting us and trying to come to terms with who we are
and why we are here.

<br><br>

The
biggest question, basically, is: <I>Where
are we going? Do we have a future as a species and a race?</I>
And I will tell you bluntly and honestly that I believe that our
destiny is in the stars. [applause]
<br><br>

Now
we talk about... forgive me for deviating again here sweetheart, I am
so sorry. Just last week my country celebrated 40 years of
anniversary of the landing of the Apollo on the Moon. They take great
pride in saying: <I>Look
what we did. Isn&rsquo;t this neat? We went to the Moon!</I>


<br><br>

But
what they didn&rsquo;t tell the American public is that NASA
purposely erased 40 rolls of film about the Apollo landings. They
purposely erased 40 rolls of film on the Apollo landings and would
not release this information to the American people.

<br><br>

The
big secret was what we found when we got on the Moon. We found
overwhelming evidence that we were not alone. They followed us all
the way to the Moon. They followed us around the Moon. They followed
us all the way home. And they watched every move we made while we
were on the Moon.

<br><br>

All
of this was filmed. That explains to you why those 40 rolls of film
were erased. But not all of those pictures disappeared. There were
some honest people working in NASA back in those days, and some of
those pictures survived. And I have brought a considerable number of
photographs of those NASA pictures with me to this conference and I
am going to share them tomorrow night. [applause]
<br><br>

I
must tell you they are shocking; they are stunning, and to some
people, they will be literally overwhelming. But I will say to you as
I will say to the American people and have for the last 20 years:
<I>Damn
it! You have a right to the truth!</I>


<br><br>

And
to use a military term: <I>You
have a </I><I>need
</I><I>for
the truth.</I>


<br><br>

And
I want to thank you and Good Evening.
