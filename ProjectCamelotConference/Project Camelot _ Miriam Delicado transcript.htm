I don&rsquo;t want                        to be talking to you. I really don&rsquo;t. I wish I could put                        on a mask and not be here. But I am, because in my heart, in                        my mind, in my entire being, I know that we are on a path that                        is frightening. </span></p>                <p class="style7">... There are people all over the Earth that have had                  experiences similar to mine, and we&rsquo;re all waiting for                  the right time to stand up in unity &ndash; <em>In Unity</em> &ndash; and                  come forward and speak to the world. </p>                <p class="style7">...  and immediately this rush came over me. I thought: <em>Ahhhh...  this                    is it.</em> And he said: <em>Have you ever worked for the                    CIA or the FBI?</em> And of course, I&rsquo;m 22 years old.                    I don&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with this. I&rsquo;m                    thinking: <em>Why is this happening to me?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So what makes this fascinating is that as a child growing                  up, my father on numerous occasions had told me a story of                  him being on the streets of Paris during the war &ndash; because                  of course he&rsquo;s from Europe &ndash; and how a man approached                  him. And what my father said was that they asked him to become                  part of this Psychic Army, the Russian Psychic Army. </p>                <p class="style7">And he kept saying to me: <em>If they ever come to you, do                    not go with them. Do you understand? Don&rsquo;t ever go                    with them, because if you do, they will own you.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">...  I was shown an image of being in an underground base                  that... what took place there was so dark and ugly and horrifying                  to me that it was difficult for me to deal with. </p>                <p class="style7">...  <em>What are you doing here? Why can&rsquo;t                    you just leave me alone?</em> And then I walked on board                    the craft.</p>                <p class="style7">...  The knowledge is that we&rsquo;re not alone, that                  we&rsquo;re being watched, that what we&rsquo;re doing is being                  looked upon by other beings that do have a certain amount of                  knowledge that we ourselves do not have. </p>                <p class="style7">...  I have seen the future through them, with their assistance. </p>                <p class="style7">...  I believe that <em>because</em> we are being awakened                  to begin sharing this information with people, that there <em>are</em> great                  changes that are coming and that we need to all understand                  that. Whether it was going to be a meteor hitting the Earth,                  or whether it was going to be war breaking out, or whether                  it was going to be famine, or there was going to be Earth changes                  that took place &ndash; any of these things -- that man had                  the ability to change this timeline of what it was that was                  going to be coming.</p>                <hr>                <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><font color="#990033">Start                          of interview</font></strong></em></font></p>                <p class="style7">Kerry Cassidy: Hi, I&rsquo;m Kerry Cassidy                  from Project Camelot, and we&rsquo;re here with Miriam Delicado.                  And she&rsquo;s                  got a website called <a href="https://alienbluestar.com" target="_blank">Alienbluestar.com</a>,                  and she&rsquo;s got                  a very interesting story to tell.

Thank you so                  much for having me, Kerry.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Absolutely. It&rsquo;s a real pleasure. I&rsquo;ve                  read your book. It&rsquo;s a wonderful book. And why don&rsquo;t                  you just start at the beginning, whatever feels comfortable,                  and tell the people your story? And let&rsquo;s go from here.</p>                <p class="style7">Miriam Delicado: Okay. To start, it&rsquo;s                  a very, very big story and it&rsquo;s difficult for me to be                  able to convey to people the story of my life, which is what                  I tried to do a little bit in my book, <em>Blue Star,</em> is                  give people an overview of many of the things that have happened                  to me. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;ve had a very interesting past twenty                  years of my life, where I&rsquo;ve had numerous contacts with                  extraterrestrials from other places. And often people have                  asked me where it is that these beings are from. And that&rsquo;s                  a very big question, so we&rsquo;ll get into that in a little                  bit.</p>                <p class="style7">But to give the viewers an overview: You know, my life started                  out very strange right from the very beginning, and my life                  was not an ordinary one when I was growing up. I first started                  to notice that I was different probably when I was about two                  years old. And I actually have memories that could take me                  all the way back to being a baby as well as... Most of                  my remembering came back to me when I was about two. </p>                <p class="style7">So when I was probably about 9 years old my psychic abilities                  started to kick in and numerous strange things started to happen                  to me. I was having very vivid dreams and all sorts of things                  along those lines that I really couldn&rsquo;t explain. </p>                <p class="style7">I used to play this little game when I was a child, about                  watching the people in the cars... as I was driving past                  them in a car. And I would try to think of what they were saying                  or thinking in their heads. And when I did that, it was fascinating                  to me, some of the things that I would hear them thinking about.                  But at the same time I was always scared that they would know                  that I was, you know, probing into their minds, and I never                  wanted to get caught doing that. </p>                <p class="style7">So that&rsquo;s a very, very clear memory for me ever since                  I was very, very young. It&rsquo;s not something that I do                  now. It&rsquo;s not something that I do consciously, ever,                  at any point, because of course I would have to ask someone&rsquo;s                  permission in order to do that. So right from the very beginning                  I was a little bit different.</p>                <p class="style7">And as my life moved forward, these abilities of mine just                  became stronger and stronger. And by the time I was a teenager,                  I was doing all sorts of things. I was having dreams that were                  prophetic. And, you know, to use terms that people would understand,                  I saw a number of visions that actually came true within a                  very short period of time. And I also had encounters with,                  sort of, <em>beings</em> that I wasn&rsquo;t clear with where                  they were from or what focus they... where they came from. </p>                <p class="style7">And it was really unnerving for me growing up, because even                  though I knew that my father had some sort of abilities as                  well, I wasn&rsquo;t close enough to him to be able to talk                  to him about it. And that made my earlier years very difficult,                  just for that reason alone.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, my father was an interesting character in my life because                  he seemed to possess certain abilities as well. And when we                  were kids we were always, you know, a little bit nervous around                  him, thinking that he would always know what we were doing.</p>                <p class="style7">So when -- jumping way forward into my life, into the year                  1988, which is 20 years ago, it was interesting when I did                  have this encounter on the highway in northern British Columbia                  with extraterrestrials. And this was a physical encounter that                  took place that changed my entire life. </p>                <p class="style7">But when it happened, it was almost immediate that I knew                  that my father had had contact, simply because...  A number                  of the things that I was told by these beings, my father used                  to talk about when we were kids all the time -- about how the                  world would eventually change, and how we needed to learn how                  to survive, and what it is that we needed to do. This type                  of thing. So I always knew that he&rsquo;d had contact.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t he also work for the, you know, an agency,                  a secret... you know, in Intel in some capacity?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Not that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Because you talk about him being approached. And                  he also warned you about being approached at some point. Isn&rsquo;t                  that right?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Yes. </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And how do you know that unless, you know, you&rsquo;ve                  been approached? </p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; That was a very interesting story that my father                  used to tell me as a child. It was a fascinating story that                  always, you know, made me really nervous and I had no clue                  as to what he was talking about. So what I need to do is step                  forward, past 1988.</p>                <p class="style7">It was a couple of years later and I was working                  at a little yogurt shop. And this is a really fascinating piece                  to this puzzle of my life, and even I myself am still, to this                  day, made a little bit wary of it. </p>                <p class="style7">So the year was, you know, a couple of years                  after 1988 and I was working in this yogurt shop. And I was                  just having a normal day, or I was trying to. And this man                  walked past the window of the shop and he looked directly at                  me, into my eyes. </p>                <p class="style7">And when he did, he came right in the door, walked right up                  to me, looked me straight in the eye, and he said: <em>Do you                  work for the CIA or the FBI?</em> <br>                  And I said: <em>No. I don&rsquo;t.</em> And immediately this                  rush came over me, and I thought: <em>Ahhhh... this is                  it</em>. <br>                  And he said: <em>Have you ever worked for the CIA or the FBI?</em> <br>                  And of course, I&rsquo;m 22 years old. I don&rsquo;t want to                  have anything to do with this. I&rsquo;m thinking: <em>Why                  is this happening to me?</em> I said: <em>No. I haven&rsquo;t.</em> <br>                  And then he proceeded to tell me...  He said: <em>Have                  you ever thought about working for the Russians?</em> <br>                  And of course I said: <em>Absolutely not.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And he then proceeded to tell me how the Russians had been                  working with people like myself for a very long time. And that                  if I joined them, that I would never be alone again, that I                  would be surrounded with people that were like me. And I said                  I was not interested.</p>                <p class="style7">And what he was talking about was the Psychic Program. And                  he said that the Psychic Program had been going on for a very                  long time, and of course I knew all about this. And I very                  nicely, politely, with a smile on my face, looked at this man                  and said that I was not interested. </p>                <p class="style7">And he kept pushing and saying: <em>Do you know how strong                    you are? </em><br>                  And I smiled at him. I said: <em>Yes, I do know how strong                  I am.</em> <br>                  And he said: <em>But can you control your abilities?</em> <br>                  And I said: <em>Actually, I can.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And then he said that they would still be very much interested                  in working with me. And I told them that there was no way.                  I said: <em>What I would like you to do is go back to the people                  that sent you here, thank them very much for their interest                  and tell then that there&rsquo;s no point in ever coming back                  because I will never be interested.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So what makes this fascinating is that as a child growing                  up, my father on numerous occasions had told me a story of                  him being on the streets of Paris during the war &ndash; because                  of course he&rsquo;s from Europe &ndash; and how a man approached                  him. And what my father said was that they asked him to become                  part of this Psychic Army, the Russian Psychic Army. </p>                <p class="style7">And he kept saying to me: <em>If they ever come to you, do                    not go with them. Do you understand? Don&rsquo;t ever go                    with them, because if you do, they will own you.</em> <em>You                    can&rsquo;t run and you can&rsquo;t hide because they will                    find you with their minds.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And so of course I was always very frightened by this. And                  it didn&rsquo;t make any sense to me growing up. But in that                  moment, as soon as the man walked into the store and said: <em>Do                  you work for the CIA or the FBI?</em> I knew exactly who he                  was, what he was there to ask me, and I was very adamant that                  I was not interested. And I&rsquo;m not interested for <em>anyone</em> to                  do something along those lines.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Okay. Yeah. I remember that story from your book                  and I think it&rsquo;s a real bell-ringer. I think your father                  had... what? Maybe Native American blood somewhere in there?                  He&rsquo;s certainly got, I don&rsquo;t know, European...  What                  would you say your background is, just in terms of genetics,                  I guess?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; My mother is German and, as far as I know, all the                  way back she&rsquo;s German. My father is Yugoslavian. And,                  as far as I know...  His family history going far, like                  way, way, way back, I believe that there&rsquo;s some interesting                  blood there. But for me to say anything for certain would not                  be fair to him or to anyone because I am not sure. </p>                <p class="style7">But as far as Native American blood goes, no, I don&rsquo;t                  believe that there is. But, with his bloodline, if there&rsquo;s                  anyone interested in looking it up that would be able to go                  very far back, meaning, you know, even thousands of years,                  I think that it would be fascinating to see where it led.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Okay. So let&rsquo;s go to your incident in 1988                  and tell a little more about that, kind of capsulate it, if                  you will.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; In 1988 I was living a very normal, average life                  as a young adult. I&rsquo;d just moved from a small town into                  the big city in Vancouver, British Columbia. And my friends                  and I had decided to take a road trip to my home town. And                  on the way up there, everything was normal. We took the drive                  and everything was fine. But on the return journey <em>everything</em>,                  everything changed.</p>                <p class="style7">There were four of us, four adults and a young child in the                  car. And the trip... we were driving for hours. I was sleeping                  in the back seat of the car. And then it started to get dark                  out. The people that were driving wanted a break, so they went                  into the back seat, and I went up into the front, into the                  passenger side with my friend. And right away these big balls                  of light... they looked like truck lights, actually; that&rsquo;s                  what we thought that they were for the longest time... came                  streaming up behind us rather quickly in the car. And as that                  happened, we were wondering why they were traveling so fast.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, these particular lights followed us for hours and hours                  in the darkness. And every time we came up to a car or any                  kind of house or buildings at all, the lights would fall back                  and disappear. </p>                <p class="style7">So after hours of this going on, eventually we went through                  a town where we thought for sure that we had lost the lights.                  And as soon as we got to the other side of this town, into                  the forested area, the absolute moment we said: <em>Okay, we&rsquo;re                  clear. There&rsquo;s no way they can catch up with us</em>...  and                  literally in the blink of an eye, there they were, these balls                  of light that were probably about this big. [holds hands about                  12 inches apart]</p>                <p class="style7">And they came up behind us. And then &ndash; poof -- and at                  this point, after hours they had been appearing and disappearing,                  appearing and disappearing, and in the blink of an eye. So                  my friend got very, very nervous, as I did. Neither one of                  us were comfortable with what was happening at all, and the                  people in the back seat were still sleeping.</p>                <p class="style7">So all of a sudden I screamed at her and I said: <em>Pull                    over the car right now! It&rsquo;s not you they want. It&rsquo;s                    me! </em>And I went to grab the steering wheel to pull her                    over, when all of a sudden she just sort of flopped, you                    know, like a Raggedy Ann doll, flopped her head over and                    started pulling over and stopped at the side of the road. </p>                <p class="style7">And by that time the car filled with light from every direction.                  And these balls of light were sitting behind the car. So at                  that point -- I was the only one conscious at that time --                  when I turned from the back of the car to the front, I saw                  a craft on the road. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I couldn&rsquo;t make out any detail because it looked                  almost misty and very, very bright. And these beings that were                  about four feet tall walked... were walking towards me.                  They were very androgynous, almost childlike in their nature.                  And they had big <em>round</em> black eyes. They didn&rsquo;t                  have any oval eyes at all. These were round black eyes. </p>                <p class="style7">And they were directing me to get out of the car, which I                  did. And I was very scared. I wasn&rsquo;t terrified though,                  and that distinction needs to be made. I was not terrified.                  I was scared.&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">So I got out of the car. They led me down the highway a little                  bit, and at this point I wasn&rsquo;t even thinking about my                  friends, I was just wondering where they were taking me.</p>                <p class="style7">And on this embankment on the left... they led me up the                  embankment where I saw, when I looked up, a larger craft that                  had two beings standing in this doorway. And they had blond                  hair -- and I mean blond as in snow white hair -- and the most                  brilliant blue, Mediterranean water blue, eyes that you&rsquo;ve                  ever seen, and quite incredible. And the beings, the short                  ones, took me to the craft, and when I got to the doorway I                  walked onboard the craft. </p>                <p class="style7">But what was interesting was that just prior to all of this                  happening I&rsquo;d had a dream in the back seat of the car.                  And in this dream that I had, this man and woman told me, they                  said: <em>We are coming for you soon. Do not be afraid. We                  are your friends. We are your family. Do not be afraid</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">And then, when I saw these two tall beings, the moment that                  I laid eyes on them, I said in my mind: <em>What are you doing                  here? Why can&rsquo;t you just leave me alone?</em> And then                  I walked onboard the craft.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And did you have any memories of what happened on                  the craft at that point?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; From the moment I walked off that craft, I had very                  clear memories. And I have had those clear memories for twenty                  years.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Clear memories of what happened <em>on</em> the craft?                  Or just clear memories up to the point you&rsquo;ve told us?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Both. Once I was onboard the craft, I remember a                  great deal of what happened to me. I do not by any means remember                  the full three hours. I don&rsquo;t. And I don&rsquo;t know                  if I ever will or not, because up to this point...  I mean,                  I have not had hypnosis done to recover memories. So that&rsquo;s                  a very important point for me to make to anyone watching, is                  that these memories have come from conscious memories. </p>                <p class="style7">So, in other words, I walked onto the craft, I had this encounter.                  It took me some time, but I did come to realize that it was                  a total of three hours. It was very clear math that I did to                  work this out. So there was three hours of missing time. And                  I remember quite a bit of the information that they gave me                  at that time.</p>                <p class="style7">There were, ah...  There were things that have stayed                  with me so clearly that even as I&rsquo;m looking at you I                  can still see the images in my mind every time I hear about ... you                  know... </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Can you give us an idea what was conveyed to you                  at that time? And does that have something to do with what                  you&rsquo;re doing here now, visiting Sedona and Hopiland,                  the Four Corners area?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; It has everything to do with it. Twenty years ago                  I was given messages. And these messages and information that                  I was given were so crystal clear to me that two days after                  I walked off the craft I had a clear understanding of all of                  my psychic abilities, and where they came from, and how I had                  them, and why I had them. </p>                <p class="style7">I had a great understanding of my father that I&rsquo;d never                  had before in my life. I knew that he&rsquo;d had contact.                  I had a clear understanding that there were many other people                  in the world that were like myself and that all of these things                  were related.</p>                <p class="style7">And after two days I started writing quite a bit of this down.                  I did not by any means write it <em>all</em> down, but there                  were key points that I did put on paper. Now at the time, even                  with some of them, I did not understand the full extent of                  what it was in this information, but it was about the Four                  Corners area as being one of the &ldquo;safe lands&rdquo; in                  what they termed the End Times -- if these End Times came in                  the form that they were giving warnings about. </p>                <p class="style7">So they gave me warnings about possible futures in which the                  planet could potentially have destruction, and the people could                  potentially have a very difficult time.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, these warnings were just possibilities, but they were                  things that they had made very clear to me, crystal clear to                  me, that humanity had a choice in whether or not we were going                  to end up on this destructive path or a positive path. </p>                <p class="style7">So, many of these things were told to me twenty years ago.                  But, getting into it a little bit deeper, they also told me                  a great deal about the Four Corners area in particular.</p>                <p class="style7">So of course I did not, at that time as I was still trying                  to process all of this information, truly understand what it                  was that they were saying, how this particular area was a &ldquo;safe                  land,&rdquo; and how at this time there were certain people                  that would gather together in this area. </p>                <p class="style7">The Four Corners area is a really important area to these                  beings and it is because it is one of the center points on                  the Earth where gatherings will take place for many people.                  And it does not necessarily mean that everyone needs to pack                  up, leave, and go to the Four Corners area because it&rsquo;s                  a &ldquo;safe land.&rdquo; </p>                <p class="style7">What it means is that, even if an individual travels through                  the area, they are going to be able to have information coming                  to them within their own selves in order to assist them and                  help them to know where it is they need to be on the planet.</p>                <p class="style7"><em>If</em> there is a great cataclysm that does take place,                  there are certain areas on the Earth that will be in safe zones.                  But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re going to be able                  to go there and be taken care of. What it means is that these                  areas will not have that great destruction, but it still will                  be in chaos. So that needs to be clarified to everyone and                  that there are these particular safe spots and safe lands all                  over the Earth.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, the indigenous people all over the Earth have known these                  things for thousands of years, and they are the ones that have                  all of this knowledge as to where all of these particular areas                  are. And if we take a look at their myth stories, we are going                  to be able to find that information. </p>                <p class="style7">And, at the same time, this has been guarded by them for thousands                  of years so that, if we needed the information, it would be                  made public for everyone. So it&rsquo;s really important. The                  Hopi, as well as others on the planet, play a part in this. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, there needs to be some very clear understanding here                  about what I&rsquo;m going to say, because I do have friends                  that are in Hopi. And I have talked to people there, but by                  no means at all am I a spokesperson for them or do I speak                  on their behalf whatsoever.</p>                <p class="style7">So what I&rsquo;m going to do is, I&rsquo;m going to share                  my experience with you. I&rsquo;m not going to talk about Hopi.                  I&rsquo;m going to share my experiences that revolve around                  them.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Maybe you can tell us where the link up came? You                  were told by these beings in 1988, somehow. I assume this is                  when you were also told to come to Hopi at some point. There                  was also some kind of a, I don&rsquo;t know if it was a stone                  or a necklace, or something that you had, and you buried in                  your back yard? Do you want to share that story before we kind                  of move into the bigger picture?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Yes. The relationship between these beings and the                  Hopi, for example...  Again, this is only from my experiences,                  and it&rsquo;s fascinating. Even to me it&rsquo;s fascinating. </p>                <p class="style7">When I was onboard the craft, I was sitting in what I call                  a &ldquo;light chair,&rdquo; and it was... you could look                  at it just like this. [points to the chair she&rsquo;s sitting                  on.] Except, instead of it being a chair, it was made from                  pure light, so it almost glowed. And I sat in this chair, and                  I looked across the room, and I had a being on either side                  of me. And a screen popped up. And the screen was actually                  quite large. It was probably about this... as large as                  the chair, and you know. Two or three feet high. And as I looked                  at the screen, there was information that came across it. And                  images. </p>                <p class="style7">These images would be accompanied by information that was                  given to me by these beings, either through telepathy or --                  meaning they would directly speak to me -- or it felt like                  there was just a constant flow of information being sort of                  placed within my mind. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, one of the things that they shared with me was the creation                  of man. And this is very much related to the Hopi and all of                  the indigenous people and ourselves. </p>                <p class="style7">So, to make this story really short, they explained that they                  had a hand in creating mankind, but by no means were they God.                  That they were the helpers of this Earth to insure that...  They                  were overseers, so that they would be here to watch over the                  Earth, to help man become more than what they currently are. </p>                <p class="style7">So, in the beginning life was created but nothing came of                  it. So they...  It&rsquo;s like saying that they threw                  the seeds of life across the land just to see what would come                  up. And the idea was that a vessel would be made so that the                  sparks of life -- us -- could then enter and experience life                  in this world. But nothing ever came of it. </p>                <p class="style7">In the Second World, they gave this life more form, but still                  thought that it would evolve into something more. And again                  nothing of any real value was produced. </p>                <p class="style7">In the Third World that they created...  And, again, these                  are the things that were shown and told to me. And in the Third                  World, they said that the form -- meaning our bodies -- were                  created, and then our souls would come into the bodies. And                  when they did, we had all this knowledge; we had all this ability                  to communicate with one another; we had telepathy; we had an                  understanding far beyond what we currently do right now.</p>                <p class="style7">But it was like giving children matches to play with without                  allowing them to evolve, more along the lines of emotionally,                  and to be able to handle all of this knowledge. So they kind                  of went crazy. They played around too much. They were becoming                  destructive. And the things that they did were very dark and                  evil at that point. </p>                <p class="style7">So again the world was sort of cleaned out, cleaned off, and                  again these new vessels were created -- meaning the vessels                  that we have now. So there&rsquo;s been a slow evolution of &ldquo;mankind&rdquo; over                  time.</p>                <p class="style7">As this took place, one of the things that happened was...  In                  this Third World I was shown an image of these people. And                  it was sort of like looking from above. And I looked down into                  this room and I saw these people. And these people, I was told,                  were living the life that was intended, which was the spiritual                  life. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, because they had this great knowledge, and because                  they had a&nbsp; true understanding of why they were here and                  the bodies that they had seemed to be doing very well, they                  were spared and taken from the Third World and brought into                  this, the Fourth World.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, one of the things that happened in this vision is I was                  told that one day I would find these people and I would know                  what to do. </p>                <p class="style7">So when I went into the Four Corners area for the very first                  time in 2003, I knew I had to go through Hopi but I really                  didn&rsquo;t know why. The only thing I knew was that there                  was a reason for this, and it was a very big reason, and it                  was very, very important. </p>                <p class="style7">So when I did go through Hopi, I had what I would call a &ldquo;psychic                  flash,&rdquo; where I saw some of these Hopi people and they                  changed right in front of my eyes. And it was in this flash                  that I had all of the visions that were given to me onboard                  the craft, as well as what they wanted me to do, as well as                  what was happening on the Earth, where we came from, where                  we&rsquo;re going. </p>                <p class="style7">It was just mind blowing. It was so much. But most important,                  I realized that these were the people that they wanted me to                  find. I realized that the Hopi were these individuals that                  were taken &ndash; &ldquo;individuals&rdquo; meaning people                  -- that were taken from the Third World into the Fourth World,                  and that they had a great purpose at this time. </p>                <p class="style7">So it was no surprise to me that I came across them at all.                  And their role on the planet is very important for the future                  of everyone.</p>                <p class="style7">It is my hope, and I hope with my heart, that all of us --                  meaning the Hopi, the indigenous from all around the world,                  and everyone else that has an understanding and a caring and                  a passion and a desire to help this planet -- will truly come                  together and be able to save us from this destructive path                  that I was shown.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; You came to Hopi, though, and it was an interesting                  sort of series of events that put you there. And then also... and                  I don&rsquo;t know, this may encompass beyond 2003... but                  your experience of meeting...  And I don&rsquo;t know his                  name. He&rsquo;s an Hopi elder, I believe. And you ended up                  staying at his house. </p>                <p class="style7">Do you want to tell a little of that story? Because its kind                  of...  It&rsquo;s really compelling, in the sense that                  here you are, a complete stranger, a white woman, walking into                  this tribal setting, and in some strange way they seem to have                  accepted you and welcomed you in.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; In 2004 I took a trip again by myself. And during                  this particular journey, I knew before I even went there what                  was going to happen. And I was very nervous. </p>                <p class="style7">On the first trip I bought a ring at a little store in Hopi.                  And I went back there in 2004 and talked to the woman that                  sold me the ring. And I was trying to tell her some of these                  things that had happened to me. And the way that I talked about                  it was...  I kept telling her I had these visions, or I                  had these dreams, and how I came to all this information. And                  she was really taken aback by the things that I was saying. </p>                <p class="style7">And she said to me: <em>I think you should speak to one of                    our elders</em>. So she hummed and hawed about who she should                    send me to. And then she told me: Go to this mesa. This is                    where this person is. This is their name. </p>                <p class="style7">And I was thinking: <em>Oh wow. This is it.</em> I knew this                  was going to happen. </p>                <p class="style7">So I go up onto the mesa and I find this man. And he was not                  very impressed that I was at his door, initially. And he was                  kind of humming and hawing, like: <em>What are you doing here?</em> <em>I                  can&rsquo;t help you</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">And I said: <em>No, I&rsquo;m only here to share this with                    you. That&rsquo;s it.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So I again started this amazing story, about how I had these                  visions and dreams about certain things and how I found them                  to be completely related to Hopi prophecies. And that they                  weren&rsquo;t just <em>related</em>. They were almost &ndash; almost                  -- <em>identical</em> in their nature. And the story of their                  creation story, again, exactly the same as what these tall                  blond entities and beings had told me. </p>                <p class="style7">So I was telling him all of this. And then finally he looked                  at me and he said: <em>Wait a minute. Are you talking about... ?</em> He                  kind of leaned across the table and said: <em>Are you talking                  about aliens?</em></p>                <p class="style7">And I thought: <em>Ahhhh... .</em> It was such a relief.                  It was such a relief in that moment because I had to wait for                  him to bring it up. And I said: <em>Yes</em>. And he said: <em>Okay.                  Okay, now talk to me. Now tell me this story.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So I continued talking to him, and he appeared to understand                  and know what it was that I was talking to him about. And at                  that point, you know, after I had been speaking to him for                  hours, he looked at me and he said: <em>Why are you here?</em> <br>                  And I said: <em>I&rsquo;m here to share with you.</em> <br>                  And he said: <em>No. Why are you here? I don&rsquo;t understand. </em>And                  he was just kind of shaky about it. <br>                  And I said: <em>Well I&rsquo;m only here to share this story                  with you. </em><br>                  And he said: <em>You know, I have had people come from all                  over the world.</em> He has himself, as well as Hopis. They                  have people come from all over the world. <br>                  And he said: <em>They come with similar stories, but not like                  this.</em> He said: <em>All of them come here and they ask                  me questions. And you haven&rsquo;t asked me a single question.                  Why?</em> <br>                  And I said: <em>What could I possibly ask you that I don&rsquo;t                  already have the answer to?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So that made him even more nervous. And it&rsquo;s not because                  I believe that I have all of the answers. It is because I know                  that for myself I don&rsquo;t need a Hopi to tell me something.                  I know what I need to know and I&rsquo;m content with that.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, what happened after being with him for some time is even                  more fascinating, because I left at one point. He asked me                  to leave because someone came to his home. And I walked out                  of his house. And I walked along the mesa, at which time I                  started walking towards the Hopi woman&rsquo;s home who sold                  me the ring. She told me where she lived. Her daughter was                  outside. So I started talking and sitting with her daughter. </p>                <p class="style7">And very quickly after that she started speaking Hopi to one                  of her friends. And I think it was that moment that I said                  to myself: <em>That&rsquo;s it. There is absolutely not an                  ounce of questioning left anymore.</em> Because in that moment                  she said a word in Hopi that I recognized as being one of the                  words that these tall blond aliens spoke to me. And I asked                  the little girl. I said: <em>What does that mean?</em> And                  she said: <em>It&rsquo;s thank you; saying thank you to a woman                  in Hopi.</em> And I said: <em>Wow. That&rsquo;s amazing.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So the two of us were walking around for a little while, and                  I went in to get a pop from this little place, something to                  drink. And when I was in this area, I all of a sudden heard                  in my head: <em>What are you doing here?</em> Very clearly,                  as if someone was standing right beside me. </p>                <p class="style7">And when I looked to my right at this long counter, there                  standing at the counter was one of these beings: Blond hair,                  blue eyes. They&rsquo;re probably about, I don&rsquo;t know,                  6&rsquo; 4&rdquo;, built as if they were, you know, had been                  working out for their entire lives -- just really, really strong                  looking. </p>                <p class="style7">And he stared at me and said: <em>What are you doing here?</em> <br>                  And I again said: <em>Well, I&rsquo;m coming home. What are                  you doing here?</em> You know... Why are you asking me?                  type of thing. </p>                <p class="style7">And there was no conversation with him, but I knew who he                  was, completely. And I wanted to walk up to him and say: <em>Oh,                  what are you doing here? Let&rsquo;s sit down and talk.</em> But                  again I just kept walking with this little girl, thinking: <em>No.                  It&rsquo;s not the right time.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">I was walking out of this area and I said to the little girl: <em>Did                    you see that man in there?</em> <br>                  [She said]: <em>Yeah</em>. <br>                  I said: <em>Did you recognize him? </em><br>                  She said: <em>No, I&rsquo;ve never seen him before. </em><br>                  And I said: <em>Okay</em>. So I thought: <em>Wow. That is so                  strange.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">There&rsquo;s something about that that I&rsquo;d like to                  share that&rsquo;s not in the book, which is fascinating, that                  has to do with this. </p>                <p class="style7">But to continue, I went back to this elder&rsquo;s home. And                  when I did, I said to him: <em>This is what happened when I                  was with the little girl. I heard this word being said as one                  of these words that these beings spoke to me in.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So there I was, sitting at this elder&rsquo;s table, and out                  of my back pocket I pulled out a piece of paper and I opened                  it up. And I said: <em>This is the language that they spoke                  to me in</em>. And I pushed the piece of paper over to him.                  So he tried to...  <br>                  I said: <em>They&rsquo;re all phonetically written because                  I didn&rsquo;t know how to write this.</em> <br>                  And he said: <em>Well, why don&rsquo;t you just tell me what                  the words are?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So I read them out. And as I did, at least 6 of the words                  on the piece of paper were Hopi. One for sure, I know for sure,                  is Navajo. And he told me that other words that were on this                  piece of paper that he thought were Navajo words. </p>                <p class="style7">So these beings...  In 1988, when I&rsquo;d never had                  any exposure to Hopis or Navajos in any way, shape, or form,                  as a 22-year-old young girl living a very normal life, these                  beings spoke to me in a language that I knew for twenty years                  at this point today. I knew all that time that one day I would                  find the people whose language this belonged to. I just didn&rsquo;t                  expect them to be Hopis. I always thought that I&rsquo;d find                  them in the jungles of South America or something.</p>                <p class="style7">[Kerry laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">So, this being that I saw in the mesa...  What happened                  after that trip in 2004 when I returned home was, I went for                  dinner with a friend of mine, and I was telling him all about                  my journey and that type of thing. We took a drive in his car.                  Him and his wife were in the front seat. And in the back seat                  I was sitting behind the driver, and his nine-year-daughter                  was to the right of me. </p>                <p class="style7">So, as we&rsquo;re driving down a very busy street in Vancouver,                  very busy street, one of the major streets, a Jeep rolls up                  beside the car. And as it does, I looked, and there sitting                  in the car was this blond being, blond-haired, blue-eyed being,                  that was sitting and completely... head cocked to the one                  side and looking at me directly, without looking at the road                  at all. Didn&rsquo;t look at the road at all. Just sat there                  and... with his head... just stared at me. And I thought: <em>No                  way.</em> That&rsquo;s all I could think. </p>                <p class="style7">But here&rsquo;s the great thing. The little girl said: <em>Oh                    my god. Look at that man. He looks so weird. He doesn&rsquo;t                    even look human.</em> [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; [laughs]</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Everyone in the car just sat back and thought...  you                  know, was quickly trying to get a glimpse of this man. And                  so, then again, there I was having confirmation by another                  individual of all of these things. </p>                <p class="style7">And during a two-week period after I returned from that trip,                  I had three encounters like that: one in a store, one on the                  public transit bus, and then the one in the car with my friends.                  Very strange. Very, very strange. Even to me it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Okay. Maybe we could just kind of move ahead now                  to a little more current and what you&rsquo;ve been hearing,                  and maybe share a little bit about the fact that you&rsquo;ve... how                  you&rsquo;ve began to come forward. And especially how you                  got to write your book.</p>                <p class="style7">Because I have to say that I came across you via... I                  think I heard you on a radio show briefly, and then I saw your                  site. I saw your face, and I knew instantly that we should                  talk. And it was a drawing of your face; it wasn&rsquo;t actually                  you. But I just had a connection, and I just knew. But the                  book... then I got the book and that just confirmed what                  I&rsquo;d thought. So can you tell me about the writing of                  the book?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Big question. Very important question. And especially                  relevant for today. </p>                <p class="style7">The whole purpose behind writing this book was...  First                  of all, it was a request made by them. So in 1988 when I was                  onboard that craft, I was actually asked by them to do this.                  They asked me to come forward and share this story, to tell                  people who they were and where they were from, so that if and                  when the time came that... if they had to make their presence                  known on a global scale... that we would not be afraid. </p>                <p class="style7">So this was very important to them. This was the whole purpose                  for them sharing the knowledge that they did with me and helping                  me to try to understand the Earth, to understand ourselves,                  and to understand them. </p>                <p class="style7">The reason that it was written at this time was...  I                  have to give you a bit of a timeline. In 1988 I had what I                  call my awakening encounter, and that is the point where everything                  sort of stems from. I always revert back to 1988 when I&rsquo;m                  describing to people what has happened.</p>                <p class="style7">So I&rsquo;m told in 1988 all of these things and asked to                  share them. So I started doing some of these things that they&rsquo;d                  asked of me. And then all of a sudden they said: <em>No, no,                  no. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Quiet, quiet, quiet. No more talking.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And I knew that eventually one day I would be told when the                  right time was to come forward and start sharing this .</p>                <p class="style7">So, at the very beginning of 2003, I was sort of woke up one                  morning. They said: <em>Okay, it&rsquo;s time. It&rsquo;s time.                  It&rsquo;s time to go to the Four Corners area -- w</em>hatever                  that meant, I was not sure. But it was time for me to... what                  I would say, for lack of a better term, to start my work. So                  that happened in 2003. And after that, of course, encounter                  with the Hopi elder, and as well as a number of other things                  that happened prior to that in the Four Corners area that were                  related to 1988, I said: <em>Okay. I must start writing.</em> So                  the process began.</p>                <p class="style7">Then in 2007, near the beginning of the year, I had quite                  a few messages given to me in many different forms. They came                  to me in dreams. They came to me, you know, in my head saying: <em>You                  need to finish the book, you need to finish the book, you need                  to finish the book.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And they told me that it was very important that I had it                  done by November. And I really didn&rsquo;t know why. But they                  said November, 2007, I had to have the book done by, because                  there was a timeline of what was going to be taking place on                  the planet. </p>                <p class="style7">So I pushed and pushed and pushed myself in many ways to be                  able to have this task completed, which, just under the wire,                  I have done. So the book was done. I finished writing it. And                  then I was told to begin sharing this story with whomever would                  listen. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I was told in 1988 that I was to find the others like                  myself, and that we were to come together and that these gatherings                  would begin. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, they&rsquo;ve given me information. And that, again,                  starts to step into what I believe has to do with the indigenous                  people of the Earth because of what these beings told me. And                  they said that in the &ldquo;End Times&rdquo; that there would                  be many changes that would take place. So...  They&rsquo;re                  on many different levels. They&rsquo;re not just one. And it&rsquo;s                  not simple to describe these things.</p>                <p class="style7">I was told that one of them would be on a spiritual level,                  changes would begin to take place. On a physical level changes                  would begin. And also on an Earth basis, for the Earth itself,                  that changes would happen. </p>                <p class="style7">So all of these things were sort of being correlated and being                  written by humanity itself in the path that we are to take.                  For example, that there were the possibility that war would                  break out, for example. This is something that really disturbs                  me. It scares me. It upsets me. And even as I say this I could                  cry because...  And I might just cry. [voice breaks, choked                  up]</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s okay. Go ahead.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Because if anyone were to have lived the life that                  I have for the past twenty years, to have had the experience                  after experience after experience, confirmation after confirmation                  after confirmation, of all of these things, they too would                  not hesitate in anything, to help in whatever way they could                  to stop this process. </p>                <p class="style7">Because we have a responsibility... as human beings. I                  was told that we have a responsibility to do what we can to                  save this Earth. We&rsquo;re not the <em>saviors</em> of the                  Earth. We&rsquo;re supposed to be the <em>caretakers</em> of                  the Earth. We&rsquo;re here to be the stewards of this land.                  That is part of why we are here, to be able to experience one                  another and the Earth itself. </p>                <p class="style7">But the way that we are living our lives, based in things                  like greed as being the primary focus for most people, we&rsquo;ve                  forgotten about why it is that we are supposed to be here to                  begin with. And that is the beauty of each other and of this                  land.</p>                <p class="style7">And one of the things that I always ask people, every single                  person, and I say to them: <em>You really need to ask yourself                  this question. Are you happy?</em> It&rsquo;s a very simple                  question. The answer is what gets very complicated. </p>                <p class="style7">Because, as it was explained to me by these beings, humanity                  was on a path, a collision course, and if we didn&rsquo;t change                  it, this was going to be the end result: Destruction. </p>                <p class="style7">In whatever form... whether it was going to be a meteor                  hitting the Earth, or whether it was going to be war breaking                  out, or whether it was going to be famine, or there was going                  to be Earth changes that took place -- any of these things                  -- that man had the ability to change this timeline of what                  is was that was going to be coming. </p>                <p class="style7">Now people have said to me: <em>Well, you&rsquo;re trying                    to create a prophecy, or you&rsquo;re talking about prophecy.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">But here&rsquo;s the thing. For anyone out there that understands                  even remotely the smallest amount of this, this is easy to                  understand, what it is that&rsquo;s happened here. We&rsquo;ve                  been given a gift, a very special gift. And that is the gift                  of seeing beyond where we currently are. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, if we stay on the same path, they&rsquo;ve said this                  is going to be the end result. But the gift is, if we can change                  the course that we have been on, then all of these things will                  be averted, and they will not happen. </p>                <p class="style7">So this is the reason for the book. This is the reason that                  I&rsquo;ve come forward. Because I don&rsquo;t want to be talking                  to you. I really don&rsquo;t. I wish I could put on a mask                  and not be here. But I am, because in my heart, in my mind,                  in my entire being, I know that we are on a path that is frightening. </p>                <p class="style7">And some people get scared. I&rsquo;m not scared. These tears                  are not fear. These tears are very much sadness, because I                  have seen the future through them, with their assistance. So                  I hope that we will be able to come together as humanity to                  change that. And I believe...  I believe that we still                  can. </p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s possible at this point                  in time to stop everything. I think that we have come to a                  time where it has become apparent, and is becoming more apparent                  every day, that we are on a collision course in many different                  areas. </p>                <p class="style7">Our food supplies have in the course of the last year become                  scarce in certain areas in the world. Things like Rice, Mad                  Cow Disease, the Avian Flu. The list goes on. These things                  are all becoming apparent to everyone in the world. Fuel --                  the cost of fuel, gas prices affecting everyone in the world. </p>                <p class="style7">But all of these things can be changed very easily. And that                  is how we are going to change the Earth -- with helping one                  another.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Okay. So you have a mission and you&rsquo;re on your                  mission and here we are. This is October. Actually not October.                  This is September of 2008. Right? And it&rsquo;s a beautiful                  world outside my door today. However, there are a lot of things                  going on right now as we speak. The American economy is going                  in the tank. There is possible war with Iran right, you know,                  behind our backs could be happening, could be gearing up. And                  there are other things as well. So how is this impacting your                  sense of what you&rsquo;re doing, what your, sort of, your                  set mission, and what the next milestones are, if you will,                  that you are planning to get to?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Considering that this is 2008, that&rsquo;s a very                  interesting question for me, because it has been... I don&rsquo;t                  even know how many years, and I don&rsquo;t even know if it                  relates back to 1988... but at some point in this course                  of my life in the last twenty years, 2008 has been a year that                  has stuck with me. </p>                <p class="style7">Because I have known for <em>years</em> that between August                  of 2008 and November 2008 that there would be major changes                  on the Earth. And what I mean is...  I&rsquo;m not talking                  about changes of the Earth <em>itself,</em> but of the people.                  And maybe in some form it would have something to do with the                  United States. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I made this very public statement in January of this                  year. I said that these things were coming and that they would                  involve the United States. And what the United States did,                  and what happened here, would affect the entire world <em>forever</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">So, considering that the American economy is doing as it is,                  and the price of oil that does have to do with the United States                  in part, there are... we are at the beginning of a flow                  that is not going to be easily rectified, if at all. </p>                <p class="style7">So what people need to understand is that these things were                  told to me years and years and years ago. And so what I&rsquo;m                  saying is that 2008, there&rsquo;s going to be economic repercussions                  across the Earth that are never going to be fully recovered.                  So that&rsquo;s the first change. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;ve also seen that there are the possibilities of changes                  taking place on a global scale of things that are more geared                  towards the political structure of the Earth, in the next... probably                  4 to 6 months... that there were going to be some changes                  that were going to be taking place around this time. So that                  finishes off 2008. It&rsquo;s like a precursor to what&rsquo;s                  to come. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, the other year that I&rsquo;m concerned with, and I&rsquo;ve                  had great concern over since 1988, is not 2012 as people have                  often asked me. 2012, to myself, in the knowledge that I&rsquo;ve                  been given by these beings, is not a specific date for me to                  be even thinking about. </p>                <p class="style7">However, the year 2010 is. So what is coming in 2010? I&rsquo;m                  often asked this. And all I know is that there is the potential                  of great destruction all over the Earth. Can I say that that&rsquo;s                  war? No. I will not say that. Can I say that it is a meteor                  coming? I cannot say that. What I am saying is that humanity                  has a role to play in how this turns out in 2010.</p>                <p class="style7">So let&rsquo;s say that 2010 rolls around and nothing happens.                  You know what? I am not going to sit here and say: <em>Oh I                  was wrong.</em> I am going to be clapping in glee that we have                  averted what it is that I have seen for all this time. </p>                <p class="style7">So it is never too late. The eleventh hour is going to be                  the eleventh hour until the moment that it happens. So we always                  have time. We always have the ability to change something. </p>                <p class="style7">And I believe that...  From all of this knowledge that                  I&rsquo;ve learned, and all of these things that have been                  shown to me, I know that we have the ability to work together                  to make changes on the Earth that are going to be lasting,                  that will bring back the happiness and joy that we came here                  to be able to experience, that we&rsquo;ll put a structure                  in place for our families and our communities that is geared                  towards caring for one another and for the Earth itself.</p>                <p class="style7">And this particular time that we&rsquo;re in right now, it                  is critical that we begin to understand that we need to take                  responsibility on an individual basis, that we as individuals <em>do</em> have                  the power to change the Earth in a way that is going to be                  beneficial to our children, in a way that is going to be beneficial                  to the people that are coming after us. </p>                <p class="style7">And people ask me: <em>Why is it and what is it that makes                    this time special?</em> And it is because we are being given                    the choice, the choice of how our path is going to lead us                    and take us, and where the end is going to be. </p>                <p class="style7">If we decide that we are going to continue to be greed-filled...  Look                  into the future! It doesn&rsquo;t take much. You can see that                  there&rsquo;s no real way out of this situation that we&rsquo;re                  in unless we make some changes. So how do we do that? How do                  we make changes? </p>                <p class="style7">And I tell people -- very important. People that come here                  to Project Camelot. It&rsquo;s a prime example. It&rsquo;s                  called education. The most important thing that an individual                  can do is educate themselves. </p>                <p class="style7">And I am not talking just about political issues, or issues                  that have to do with extraterrestrials, but I&rsquo;m talking                  about educate yourself as to who you are as a person. Educate                  yourself as to how to live, how to build a home, how to grow                  food. Put your hands in the Earth again so that you remember                  who you are, so that you remember where your food came from.                  That&rsquo;s education.</p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s talking about educating yourself in all the areas                  that you need -- spiritually, emotionally, physically. Look                  at how you&rsquo;re living the choices that you&rsquo;re making.                  No one, including myself, are perfect. No one&rsquo;s perfect.                  But what we can do is, when we are able to, we can make the                  right choices so that slowly we can make a world that is on                  the right path.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Okay. So you come here, though, to Hopiland and Sedona                  and the Four Corners. And the mission is to gather the people,                  as I understand it.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And this is not just the Native American people.                  And can you talk about that a little?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; I am going to share with you a little bit of what                  was told to me twenty years ago. When I was onboard the craft,                  what I was told was to find the others like myself, to gather                  them together and bring them back to the safe lands; that a                  time would come when all of these people -- meaning the people                  that I saw living from the... taken from the Third World                  into the Fourth World, and as well as the others &ldquo;like                  myself&rdquo; -- that we would all come back together. And                  when this happened, there would be great changes that would                  take place on the Earth, for the better.</p>                <p class="style7">So it is becoming clearer and clearer to me by the day now...  See,                  it used to take years for things to come. And that&rsquo;s                  no longer the case. And that&rsquo;s a very key point, because                  people have noticed that the world, and the daily lives that                  they have, everything&rsquo;s changing -- the way that we think,                  the way that we act. Some people just seem to be floating through                  life while other people are just sort of going crazy, and they                  can&rsquo;t seem to hold their own selves and their own space.</p>                <p class="style7">What&rsquo;s happening now is that this gathering that I was                  told about 20 years ago is beginning to form. And the people                  like myself are...  There are people all over the Earth                  that have had experiences similar to mine. And we are all waiting                  for the right time to stand up in unity -- <em>in Unity</em> --                  and come forward and speak to the world. Because when the world                  realizes that we are here, and that we are strong, and that                  we have been working in our own individual ways to better the                  Earth, and to better our societies, I believe that they will                  not have a choice but to look around and say: <em>Okay, what                  do we need to do?</em></p>                <p class="style7">Because we aren&rsquo;t crazy people. People like myself are                  living very normal lives. And as I state in the book, we could                  be your best friend or your neighbor. We could be the principal                  at the school. We could be your governor, or anything in life.                  You could even be married to somebody like me and you may not                  know. But when the time comes, all of us will stand up together,                  and come out of these closets that we&rsquo;ve been living                  in, to make our presence known on a global scale.</p>                <p class="style7">So when people talk about this time, where they&rsquo;re constantly                  asking me: <em>Are these beings going to show themselves to                  us? Are they going to come out on a global scale?</em> I tell                  them that it is my understanding that these tall blond beings                  are here as the Caretakers of this Earth and that they will                  not show themselves on a global scale <em>en mass</em> unless                  it is absolutely necessary to do so &ndash; meaning, if there                  was some great cataclysm that was coming where the entire world                  would be wiped out, that they would then step in. But it is                  only then that they would do so.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, we -- people like myself -- are the ones that could come                  out on a global basis and a global scale. And this is one of                  the questions I&rsquo;ve been asked so many times, and this                  is a really important point for people to understand: That                  when they say they&rsquo;re going to come out, well yeah, we&rsquo;re                  going to come out. We&rsquo;re going to come out of your homes,                  and out of your schools, and out of your political arenas,                  and out of your preschools as your teachers. That&rsquo;s where                  we&rsquo;re going to come out first.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And doesn&rsquo;t it also...  There&rsquo;s a                  really key ingredient which involves the children and that                  the gatherings are actually going to send sort of a wave across                  the planet that&rsquo;s going to impact and stimulate all of                  the Indigo Children and all of the Crystal Children -- whatever                  you want to call them -- and they will suddenly know that the                  time is now because of this gathering, if I understand it.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; You do understand it very well. And it is important                  to note that, also when these gatherings take place, and they                  have been...  You know, one can say that these gatherings                  have been taking place all over the Earth already in small                  forms. </p>                <p class="style7">What the great gathering is, is certain individuals, certain                  groups, coming together of prominence and of &ndash; &ldquo;prominence&rdquo; meaning                  nothing more than having certain knowledge. So people all over                  the Earth with certain knowledge will come together, and when                  they stand together, they will say certain things. And what                  it&rsquo;s going to do is, it&rsquo;s going to send a message                  out to individuals, children, to young adults, to you know,                  those people that are 70 years old. </p>                <p class="style7">But it will send a message to everyone that&rsquo;s waiting,                  waiting. We all feel it. Everyone&rsquo;s felt it for a very                  long time. What are we waiting for? It&rsquo;s like sitting                  in a chair getting all jittery. What are we waiting for? We&rsquo;re                  waiting for something. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the things that they&rsquo;re waiting for is for this                  event to take place. That&rsquo;s what I believe because that&rsquo;s                  what I was told 20 years ago, that it would be a wave that                  would sort of go out to these individuals and almost send a                  message to them and say: <em>Okay. You&rsquo;re not alone.                  Let&rsquo;s wake up together and let&rsquo;s start standing                  up and be known en mass to the Earth. </em>Because then there                  will be responsibility taken by individuals. </p>                <p class="style7">But it will also mean that those people that are living in                  their homes in fear of coming out, that as we come out together,                  we will no longer be ridiculed by people but we will be... we                  will have individuals saying: <em>Okay. Teach me a little bit                  more about this path that you are on</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">Because there&rsquo;s more than one side to this phenomenon.                  And I&rsquo;m not here to talk to people or educate them about                  the darker side. What I&rsquo;m saying is that this knowledge,                  this path, this understanding that I have from these tall blonds,                  is truly about enlightening ourselves, to educating ourselves,                  to helping us to understand who we are and where we&rsquo;re                  from. And there is no hidden agenda.</p>                <p class="style7">We may not have all of the answers. I may not have all of                  the answers. But if you put me in a room with a number of other                  people, we do have the whole picture. So to say that there&rsquo;s                  other things going on is not a fair assessment, in my view. </p>                <p class="style7">So it&rsquo;s important for all of us to come together to                  the Earth <em>en mass</em> and that will be happening, I hope                  very soon.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp;&nbsp; [to Bill Ryan] Okay. Now we have time for you                  to ask your question and then we can also double back and cover                  some ground that we might have missed along the way. Okay?</p>                <p class="style7">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; I have a question which many people who are                  watching this would probably want me to ask. And that is that,                  when you talk about the Four Worlds that were mentioned both                  by your extraterrestrials contacts and that are present in                  the Hopi legend in the same form, can you match that against                  the traditional scientific thinking in terms of the fossil                  record, the evolution of man? Can you put any kind of a date                  on this? What does this actually mean to a paleontologist or                  an anthropologist? Are you able to answer that question or                  is it just not known?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; That is an interesting question to me because...  The                  way that I can explain this is that when I was onboard the                  craft I was given knowledge. It was like saying that I had                  an education in many areas. Okay? One of the areas was on the                  evolution of man and where we came from, where we&rsquo;re                  going. So in this, it was as though I went to, let&rsquo;s                  say, grade three or grade four. So I have only a little bit                  of knowledge about these different Worlds. I am not the expert.                  But I know that there&rsquo;s others like myself out there                  who would have far greater in-depth knowledge concerning this                  question. </p>                <p class="style7">What became very clear to me in the visions that I was shown                  on the screen was that, for example, in the beginning, they                  said that it was like they threw the seeds of life across the                  land and waited for life to form and nothing happened. So we                  were just, you know, like worms in mud. This is the image that                  came into my mind.</p>                <p class="style7">B:&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s billions of years ago.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Yes. Yes. In the Second World I was shown, in the                  Second World, that this very grotesque life form was produced                  and that they waited for it to evolve to see if it would be                  the right host for this spark of life -- whatever you would                  like to call it; I call it the spark of life -- to be able                  to facilitate a <em>spiritual</em> life and a greater understanding                  of the universe. </p>                <p class="style7">But this... in the Second World, the life that was formed                  was very, very... &rdquo;simple&rdquo; is the word that                  came to me. Very simple and basic and just really did not evolve.                  So, for myself, when I look at that...  Of course, when                  I came back from this experience, and it took me a while to                  even be able to put all of this, associate it to the world,                  I clearly was able to see that this was the Dinosaur Age. </p>                <p class="style7">Then in the Third World, I was shown from above the Earth                  and then again into this room where these people were that                  were taken from the Third World and brought into this World.                  And when I was shown from above, what I saw was this city that                  was very, very much filled with light. So there were cities                  but they weren&rsquo;t all over the Earth. They were just sort                  of in pockets here and there. </p>                <p class="style7">And so when I myself, as Miriam, look back through history                  at this, I see it as being some of those &ldquo;Lost Worlds&rdquo; that                  have been looked for, and some of them, part of them, found                  over the course of our lifetimes, or over the last hundred                  years.</p>                <p class="style7">So, these three Worlds that were talked about prior to this                  one... it makes very clear sense to me, in my limited knowledge                  of anthropology and paleontology and all of the rest of it.                  It just looks clear to me that these were the different Worlds.</p>                <p class="style7">B:&nbsp; Okay. My next question then that comes from that                  is that it sounds from what you&rsquo;re saying that you are                  talking time scale of the responsibility of the Caretakers.                  I think you call them that word. Other contactees of course                  have called them different terms. Some people call them &ldquo;The                  Watchers.&rdquo; Jim Sparks called them &ldquo;The Keepers.&rdquo; These                  are all approximations, presumably transposed into our language,                  for some kind of guardian race. Maybe that&rsquo;s another                  term we could use. </p>                <p class="style7">But the time scale they&rsquo;re talking about seems to be                  huge. We&rsquo;re talking about, certainly hundreds of millions                  of years and possibly billions. How advanced are these people?                  Where are they from? Who are they? Or aren&rsquo;t they extraterrestrials?                  Are they time travelers? Are they us in some way, as some people                  in my view compellingly claim? Do you know what the score is                  here? And what&rsquo;s the relationship between them and the                  other extraterrestrial races that you must have heard about?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Yes. First of all I&rsquo;d like to address the different                  names: The Keepers, The Watchers, The Caretakers. I call them                  all of these things, myself, and the reason that I do is in                  part because they <em>are</em> all of these things. They do                  watch over us; they do take care of us; they are our caretakers;                  and they keep the knowledge. In my book I write they are the                  Keepers of the Knowledge that the indigenous people are. They                  too are the Keepers of the Knowledge, and so forth. So all                  of these terms, these different terms that we use to describe                  them, are correct in my view.</p>                <p class="style7">The other question was what kind of a scale are we looking                  at as far as time is concerned? Now, it is my understanding                  again, from what they&rsquo;ve shared with me onboard that                  craft, that they have been here since the beginning of the                  Earth. And that they had a hand in creating humanity. That                  they, too, as it was described to me by them, that they too                  seek to know &ldquo;God&rdquo; -- meaning the creator of all                  that is, all that was, and all that will be, the creator of                  everything, the very beginning, the source of all things. </p>                <p class="style7">So they were given a task. It&rsquo;s like saying, you know,                  whatever your job is. When you get up in the morning and you                  go to work, that&rsquo;s what your job is. That&rsquo;s what                  you know that you do. Well, when we are here on Earth, it is                  no different for them than to say that this is what they do.                  They are the Caretakers of the Earth and this is what they&rsquo;ve                  always done.</p>                <p class="style7">As far as what timeline they&rsquo;re from, it was also described                  to me that some of them are from our past, our present, and                  our future, because the way that time was described to me,                  they did have the ability to go back and forth and in the present.                  They did have that ability. How? You&rsquo;d have to ask them                  that because I have no idea. [laughs] </p>                <p class="style7">But they also said that some of them were physical, that they                  were no different than you or I. That they lived on the Earth.                  That they did live <em>under</em> the Earth, <em>inside</em> the                  Earth. That there were others that were inter-dimensional beings,                  and there were others on different planets. That all of them                  were created for the same task in these different areas, and                  they all had the ability to communicate with one another. And                  it was like saying that they were cousins.</p>                <p class="style7">So, it&rsquo;s a very complicated question to answer because                  it is so complicated to explain. It&rsquo;s almost beyond my                  words to be able to clarify it.</p>                <p class="style7">B:&nbsp; Our contact Henry Deacon, who has encountered these                  situations from a completely different standpoint, working                  under contract for the American military and the American Intelligence                  services, has said that it would take a book of at least a                  thousand pages, and he just did not have the energy to write                  that. [laughs] Or maybe he said ten thousand. Maybe he&rsquo;s                  not counting. </p>                <p class="style7">And the impression I got is that this whole back-story is                  so complex, so deep, so convoluted, almost beyond human understanding,                  such a backdrop of complexity, that it&rsquo;s like who are                  we to try and figure this out? We&rsquo;ve actually got our                  own problems. Anything else is just intellectual curiosity.                  But the fact is that they&rsquo;re there. At least some of                  them are caring about us, it would seem. </p>                <p class="style7">The question I do have, though, linked with what I was just                  mentioning about the American military and the American Intelligence                  services. Do you know anything about the possible relationships                  of this group with the military? Or is it a different group                  of aliens that they have been working with? Do you know anything                  about that, or is that a question you are unable to answer?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; The question is: <em>Will I answer?</em> I have not                  been told anything directly by these beings as to any relationship                  that was formed with any government or any group on the Earth.                  So let me make that clear. I have not been given any direct                  information regarding that. They haven&rsquo;t said: <em>Yes                  we work with these people; we&rsquo;re working over here with                  that person.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">However, I have been shown and told certain things that were                  of a darker side, and warned of certain things. For example,                  at one point I was shown something...  It&rsquo;s difficult,                  difficult for me to talk about. I was shown an image of being                  in an underground base that...  What took place there was                  so dark and ugly and horrifying to me that it was difficult                  for me to deal with.</p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t know how to say this nicely, but it was of...  I                  saw images of beings and of creatures that were just beyond                  the human comprehension of being able to see in real life.                  Now what happened...  In this time that I was shown this,                  I was in the astral, and the being, the tall blond that I was                  with, said: <em>You must be very quiet because if you&rsquo;re                  not, they will know that we are here. And don&rsquo;t ever                  come to this particular area. It is very dangerous for you.</em> And                  I said: <em>Okey doke. I&rsquo;m not going anywhere near there.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So do these tall blonds have associations with certain groups                  on the planet? No, not that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>                <p class="style7">You asked me about these other beings that so many people                  are familiar with, which... one of the biggest ones is                  the Grays. I do not have any direct information, but here&rsquo;s                  what I was told by the tall blonds: That they are here as the                  Caretakers of the Earth and that they would help protect us                  from ourselves or other things that we may not be aware of. </p>                <p class="style7">So does that mean other beings? Absolutely. Does it mean that                  there&rsquo;s a presence of other beings on the planet? Absolutely.                  Am I here to talk about those beings with you? No. Because                  I want the message of the tall blonds to be really clear with                  people, that they are here in peace and that they do not mean                  us any harm.</p>                <p class="style7">They will <em>not</em> come here and take over the Earth.                  That is not their purpose. If it was their purpose, they would                  have done it long, long ago. And they do not have a dark agenda                  in this genetic program that they have going. And I want to                  talk about that because it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s very                  important to the people of Earth. </p>                <p class="style7">In the Third World, these individuals that were created were                  created for the purpose of spiritual development. And when                  the spiritual development was taking place, all of this knowledge                  about spirit and life was a part of who we are, where we&rsquo;re                  from, and where we&rsquo;re going. But again, to reiterate                  what I&rsquo;ve already said, it was like giving children matches.                  They just didn&rsquo;t deal with it very well. So what has                  happened since the beginning of our existence as humanity is                  that different families all over the Earth have been given                  this certain genetic information in our genome. Right? </p>                <p class="style7">And along the way, certain families are &ldquo;monitored&rdquo; by                  these Caretakers, not to do anything dark, but to help so that,                  so very slowly, these vessels that we are living in, that we                  are a part of, have the ability to withstand this greater information                  and knowledge. Because, of course, our brain is nothing more                  than a computer that is based on an electrical charge within                  the body. So if we are over-loaded with electrical charges,                  we will not be able to control the pathways in which this information                  is flowing, and we become crazy.</p>                <p class="style7">So these families have very slowly had their DNA, new strands                  of DNA, to help facilitate greater understanding, greater knowledge,                  greater respect for ourselves and the Earth. And that&rsquo;s                  what&rsquo;s happened with these families that are being monitored.                  So that is also why sometimes people have had these things                  running in their families, because they&rsquo;re one of these                  families that have been monitored. And that&rsquo;s why the                  path leading back to where we all came from would be very interesting,                  to be able to look at the family tree of some of these families                  through time.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t this the...  This is actually...  The                  Grays are in a sense working for...  At least one faction are                  working for the tall blonds, or however you want to call them,                  because you&rsquo;re talking about also in your &lsquo;88 experience,                  you have the four-foot-tall beings. Those were, I assume, the                  Grays showing you onto the ship, at which time you were meeting                  with the tall blonds. So what happens is, the Grays are actually                  handling the genetic, sort of, manipulation under the direction                  of perhaps these higher beings.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Only to a certain degree. And there needs to be some                  clarification there -- and this is one of the things that I,                  myself, have been very frustrated with in regard to the whole                  phenomenon -- is the terms that we use in order to describe                  what it is that we&rsquo;re talking about. For example, when                  I myself say the word <em>Gray</em>, the first thing that pops                  into my mind is a being that has wrinkled skin, has just the                  whole energy of fear for me personally. They have...  Their                  heads are larger, but they&rsquo;re not huge. Their eyes are                  slightly slanted. That sort of thing.</p>                <p class="style7">When I&rsquo;m talking about the Grays that I&rsquo;m talking                  about, if you wanted to call them that, these are four feet                  high with round black eyes and almost look like robots. There&rsquo;s                  no features to them whatsoever. They&rsquo;re very androgynous.                  These other Grays with the wrinkled skin and their little tiny                  noses, those are a completely different breed. So there needs                  to be clarification in that. </p>                <p class="style7">Here&rsquo;s what I tell people also. There is something that                  needs to be said about the understanding of people out there                  when someone such as myself comes forward. When we talk to                  you about our experiences, we talk to you about them not only                  from what it is that we&rsquo;ve experienced but also from                  our perceptions, understanding, and how much we were taught                  by them. </p>                <p class="style7">So this is very important, because if five people witness                  a car accident, all five people are going to tell a slightly                  different story. So the question is: Is the person telling                  the story a story-maker? Are they somebody that, you know,                  embellishes? You have to take that into account. Is the person                  a very fastidious story-teller, where they&rsquo;re telling                  every detail? You know, you have to take a look at the individual                  also to be able to know how to take that story. </p>                <p class="style7">So, when it comes to these beings, I&rsquo;ve also been told                  by certain individuals that these &ldquo;Grays&rdquo; have                  been seen with the tall blonds and that their agenda is very                  dark. But here&rsquo;s what I say. And, again, this really                  needs to be having some clarification out there regarding this                  phenomenon. I pray that if there are these beings...  I                  would ask these people watching to ask themselves this. </p>                <p class="style7">I pray that if there are Caretakers that are looking over                  us and watching over us, and if they are somehow related to                  god in any way, shape, or form, that they not judge me on the                  evil people of this Earth -- because we all look the same.                  Our general descriptions are the same. So because I am white,                  I pray that I am not judged by the evil of other white people. </p>                <p class="style7">So when you come across one of these beings, whether it is                  in your dreams, which they can come to you in, or whether it                  is in the astral, which means your light body is leaving you,                  or whether it is physical, ask yourself this, right from <em>here</em>:                  [points to her heart]<em>Do I have fear or                  am I simply just afraid? Do I have fear or terror?</em> Because                  if you have terror, you need to understand that, and you need                  to say: <em>No, I am not going to do this. I am not going to                  participate. I do not and will not be a part of this.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Right. They need to protect themselves. And they                  have this power.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And they need to know they have this power. </p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Yes.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s a very important message.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Yes. It is very important. People forget that. They                  think: <em>Oh I don&rsquo;t have any control. I don&rsquo;t                  have any power.</em> You <em>do</em> have a certain amount                  of power regarding this phenomenon when you&rsquo;re having                  contact. And so it is really important to protect yourself                  in that way, mentally. </p>                <p class="style7">And that&rsquo;s why, again, these tall blonds make it very                  clear that we need to educate ourselves, not only in what&rsquo;s                  happening around us in the world, but also on a more spiritual                  level, because the more spiritually aware you become, the stronger                  you become, the more informed as to how it is that you can                  move forward spiritually and in the astral and in the dreams,                  to be able to protect yourself from some of these other beings.</p>                <p class="style7">All of them. All of the beings that are out there, whether                  it be Grays or tall blonds, each one that I meet individually,                  I make them look at me in my eyes. I make them look, so that...  If                  they&rsquo;re looking at me and they&rsquo;re looking all over                  the place like this [moves head sporadically from side to side],                  I say: <em>No, no, no.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">I remember one dream in particular, the two blonds came to                  me and they were trying to give me this very, very strong message.                  And I said to them:<em> You need to look at me</em>. <br>                  And they said: <em>There&rsquo;s no time. There&rsquo;s no                  time.</em> <br>                  And I said: <em>No. You either stop and look at me so that                  I can look in your eyes or I&rsquo;m not speaking to you.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So I looked in their eyes and I recognized them as being peaceful                  and from the right heart. Because you can&rsquo;t look at someone,                  at the rest of their body. When we want to know who someone                  is, even in this world, we stop and we look at their eyes: <em>Can                  I look at their eyes and be comfortable?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">We have instant recognition as to whether or not we care for                  someone or not, so use that in this phenomenon as well. And                  if you do not want this happening, tell them. And just keep                  telling them that you do not and are not a willing participant,                  and you demand that they stop. You need to verbalize that.                  Will it stop? I don&rsquo;t know. It depends on your spirit.                  It depends on how strong you are.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Okay. Thank you very much for that. That&rsquo;s                  very important and I&rsquo;m glad we can put that out there.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; What I would like to share with everyone is that                  people like myself all over the Earth are being stirred to                  movement. And that stirring and that movement, I believe, is                  very relevant for every single human being on the Earth. I                  believe that <em>because</em> we are being awakened to begin                  sharing this information with people, that there <em>are</em> great                  changes that are coming and that we need to all understand                  that. </p>                <p class="style7">What is this great knowledge? The knowledge is that we&rsquo;re                  not alone, that we&rsquo;re being watched, that what we&rsquo;re                  doing is being looked upon by other beings that do have a certain                  amount of knowledge that we ourselves do not have. And that                  we need to take responsibility for ourselves -- only as the                  individual. </p>                <p class="style7">You&rsquo;re not responsible for the Earth. You&rsquo;re responsible                  for yourself. Accept that. Because we are all being awakened,                  we are all making the connections with one another. Where this                  will all lead, I believe that all of us are waiting to see.                  Because nothing is for sure. We&rsquo;re writing this plan                  as we&rsquo;re going through it.</p>                <p class="style7">One of the greatest concerns that I have...  In the views,                  the visions that I was shown, the information that was shared                  to me onboard that craft, they talked to me a lot when I was                  with them about <em>seeds</em>. And I&rsquo;m always trying                  to share this information with people. One of the things that                  could save this Earth is seeds. because if every individual                  on the planet planted a small garden, we would not have to                  produce as much oil or transportation or pollution or plastics                  to...  you know. Everything.</p>                <p class="style7">It would also give every individual on the planet a taste                  again, a glimpse of why we&rsquo;re here, to be able to experience                  the beauty around us. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, I&rsquo;m going to ask everyone to take away from this                  whole interview today...  If they educate themselves on                  any one thing, I&rsquo;m going to ask them to educate themselves                  on what is happening to the Earth&rsquo;s seeds. Because it                  is of great concern to these tall blonds and always has been,                  and even for myself, what I have learned in the last few years                  regarding seeds and what&rsquo;s happening on the Earth. It                  is <em>the</em> greatest concern that every individual should                  have.</p>                <p class="style7">If you accept that we&rsquo;re not alone, that&rsquo;s great.                  But educate yourself on seeds because it will change your view                  of the world and it will change the course of this Earth for                  the better.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Wonderful. Okay. That&rsquo;s a very different take                  than you generally hear, and I think there&rsquo;s a lot of                  wisdom there in that approach. You don&rsquo;t even need free                  energy if you just plant a garden, right?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Yeah. It&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; I wanted to share something else. You asked me a                  question. You asked me a question regarding something that                  was given to me, and I know that anyone watching this is going                  to be going back to that... </p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; ... because it&rsquo;s very important. When I                  was onboard the craft in 1988, I had memories come back to                  me from childhood that were very interesting because it was                  of a time when I was a very young child, about four or five                  years old, when I was taken onboard a craft. And this memory                  came back to me very, very clearly. I really get into the details                  of this in the book because it is a key point to this phenomenon                  for myself. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, to take this story and put it into a few sentences: I                  was taken on board a craft when I was four years old, and during                  that time, these beings gave me something and they told me                  to bury it. And they said that one day I would know what it                  was for and that I would go back and find it.</p>                <p class="style7">I get asked this all the time because I&rsquo;ve written about                  it in great detail throughout the course of my life. This thing                  keeps coming up over and over and over again. I have not found                  it yet. I know the area that it is in but I have not found                  it yet. </p>                <p class="style7">The question again is: Is it my imagination? Absolutely not.                  Because I have had far too many confirmations of this information                  given to me over the years, one in particular coming back to                  me thirty-five years after the fact -- or sorry, thirty-six                  years after the fact -- and a very clear, clear indication                  that these memories that came back were absolutely crystal                  clear. </p>                <p class="style7">So, is it there? I believe it is. Have I found it? No, I haven&rsquo;t.                  Will I let you know if I have? I think the world will know                  if I have.</p>                <p class="style7">The path that I&rsquo;ve been on for the last few years of                  my life, since 2003, has in a very round-about way been my                  driving force. And this object is constantly in my mind. And                  what I&rsquo;ve noticed is, since 2003 to the present day,                  the images of it have become clearer and clearer and clearer.                  So does that mean it&rsquo;s coming back to me? Does that mean                  it&rsquo;s physically coming back to me? I believe it is. </p>                <p class="style7">So I think we&rsquo;re all, including myself, because I live                  this life, because it is so profound every day even for me,                  and because of the things that I&rsquo;ve experienced in the                  past. I am no different than anyone else out there. I&rsquo;m                  waiting to see what happens next.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; Well, thank you very much, Miriam. I call you Miriam                  Blue Star. And there&rsquo;s a significance to the Blue Star                  that you haven&rsquo;t mentioned. Would you like to talk about                  that briefly?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Yes. The Blue Star is the prophecy of the Hopi people.                  And again I do not speak on behalf of Hopi. However, when I                  was on the craft in 1988, they told me that one day a star                  would appear in the sky for all of man to see. Nothing or no                  one would hide its presence from the world and it would be                  a sign to the people that the end is near and that it is time                  to prepare. </p>                <p class="style7">In 2003, when I went through Hopi and I went back home, I                  then went online and I started looking up the Hopi, trying                  to gather information about them. And it was then that I found                  the Hopi prophecy, which is identical as well as the creation                  myth, to the information that was given to me regarding the                  Hopi people. </p>                <p class="style7">So the Blue Star is a prophecy of the Hopi people, and I was                  told that the star would appear exactly the same as the Hopi.                  So what I would ask is that you do your own research regarding                  these people and all the indigenous people around the world.                  It will give you great insight and spiritual understanding.</p>                <p class="style7">K:&nbsp; But there was a blue star in the sky not so long                  ago. We were driving through New Mexico at the time and people                  were commenting on it. You don&rsquo;t actually know if that                  was <em>the</em> Blue Star? Is that right?</p>                <p class="style7">M:&nbsp; Because the Blue Star is a prophecy of the Hopi people,                  I cannot say for sure whether or not that was the Blue Star.                  But that was a comet that blew up. It was ... It&rsquo;s                  called 17P/Holmes. If you wanted to look it up, it will give                  you more information. And this was a comet that astounded researchers                  and astronomers because of what happened as a result of it.                  It blew up and it was showing blue in the sky all over the                  Earth. It was very, very clear at that time. Yes.</p>                <p class="style7"><br>                  <span class="style7"><em><a href="miriam_delicado.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Click                  here</font></a></em> <font color="#990033" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong>for the                  video interview </strong></em></font></span></p>                <p class="style7"> </p>                <div align="left">                  <blockquote>                    <p><font color="#FF9900" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" align="left"><strong>__________________________</strong></font></p>                  </blockquote>                </div>              </blockquote>            </blockquote>               <br><table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                          <!--DWLayoutTable-->                          <tr>                            <td width="350">                          <div align="center">                                  <table width="425" border="3" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                                    <tr>                                      <td bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><br>                                          <font color="#990033">Support Project Camelot - make a donation:</font></strong></em></font></p>                                    <div align="center"><a href="https://projectcamelotportal.com/donate.html"><img src="x-click-but21.gif" width="110" height="23" alt="Donate"></a>
