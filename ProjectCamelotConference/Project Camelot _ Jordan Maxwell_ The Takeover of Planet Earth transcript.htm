<font color="#990033"><strong><em>Introduction:</em></strong></font>
<br><br>All you need to do is just go out and do your job and have
fun and watch your basketball and stay out of the way of the adults
that run the world. I never bought that. <br><br>*** Nothing in this
world &ndash; <I>nothing</I> &ndash; works the way you think it does.
There&rsquo;s always more to the story. <br><br>*** But the reason
why I&rsquo;m here doing what I&rsquo;m doing is because of this
mutation which is being <I>foisted</I> on the human race &ndash; it&rsquo;s
being <I>forced</I> on the human race. This change that the Masters
of the Universe, so to speak, have in mind for the human race is
being <I>foisted</I> on us. <br><br>And I believe, again just my
opinion, that my part in this cosmic scheme or this cosmic play is to
call people back to their humanity and let them know: <I>You&rsquo;re
being lead down the garden path into something you don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s coming.</I> <br><br>*** You know, I can&rsquo;t stand it
when people say that this is all high technology of our government.
No. I don&rsquo;t buy that for a minute. What I&rsquo;ve seen with my
own eyes, I don&rsquo;t buy it for a minute. If it has to do with our
government, then what I have actually witnessed with my own eyes, if
it has to do with the U.S. government, then it means that the U.S.
government is in league with extraterrestrials, because what I saw is
extraterrestrial in origin. <br><br>*** But I am totally convinced
that there is now on the Earth &ndash; again, for lack of a better
term &ndash; alien presence which are the enemies of the human race,
and they are obviously enemies of whoever the original Creators of us
&ndash; because of the things I&rsquo;ve been <I>told</I>, that the
people, or the entities who created us, the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; who
created us, have enemies out there in the universe. <br><br>***
Something I want to say about Spielberg... I have many, many, many
friends in the industry and I already know because I&rsquo;ve been
told that virtually all the major names in Hollywood know who I am.
They should! I&rsquo;ve been talking for 48 years, and they&rsquo;re
using all my stuff now, so they should know me. <br><br>*** So I&rsquo;m
saying that I am totally convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt, for
myself, that there are such things as reptile aliens, though I have
never seen one, thank God. But I totally believe they&rsquo;re here &ndash;
not because of David Icke, not because of Credo Mutwa who I love
listening to; a wonderful, fascinating man. David Icke has done great
stuff. But I believe there are reptile aliens here because of my own
personal research. <br><br><I>Be aware that there is a war for your
soul.</I> <br><br>[set-up talking and joking omitted] <br><br>
<font color="#990033"><strong><em>Interview begins:</em></strong></font>
<br><br>KERRY CASSIDY (KC):&nbsp; Jordan Maxwell,
I&rsquo;m very excited to be here with you today. Bill Ryan and I --
I&rsquo;m Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot -- couldn&rsquo;t be
more thrilled to have this honor of interviewing you. <br><br>You&rsquo;re
one of the preeminent researchers; you&rsquo;ve been on the scene for
over 40 years. I think you&rsquo;re really responsible for David Icke
and Zecharia Sitchin, and numerous others coming to the fore, talking
about secret societies, the Illuminati, and really, The Powers That
Be behind the scenes. <br><br>There&rsquo;s just no doubt that
everyone, Hoagland, you name it, even Wilcock -- everyone owes you a
great <I>THANK YOU</I> for bringing this subject-matter to the fore,
and for your amazingly diligent research in this area. <br><br>You&rsquo;re
an amazing mind. You&rsquo;re really a national treasure, if you
don&rsquo;t mind my saying so, here in America, and I know you&rsquo;ve
been noticed overseas in that respect as well. So, what do you have
to say for yourself? Can you give a better introduction than that?
<br><br>JORDAN MAXWELL (JM):&nbsp; I would say that you are being very
generous and very kind and I appreciate all your words, but I view
myself as just an ordinary person just doing what I love to do, and
that is to look behind the scenes of world events, how things really
work. And I started doing this kind of research diligently. <br><br>I
grew up, and even as a child, spending most of my time in the
library. While all the other kids were out playing, I was sitting in
libraries. So I&rsquo;ve always been interested to know things that
other people don&rsquo;t seem to even know exist. I&rsquo;ve always
been interested in the secret side of life, all of the hidden things
in the world that most people are not even aware of. I&rsquo;m just
fascinated with how much there is to know that most people don&rsquo;t
even know <I>exists</I>. <br><br>And so I grew up thinking that way,
and by the time I was 19 years old, when I ended up in Los Angeles, I
decided to dedicate my whole life to studying what I would call <I>the</I>
<I>world of the occult.</I> The word <I>occult</I> simply means
<I>hidden.</I> <br><br>So much of real knowledge and wisdom is hidden
because the people who run this planet feel that true knowledge and
wisdom of how the world really works is knowledge that you don&rsquo;t
need to know &ndash; all you need to do is just go out and do your
job and have fun and watch your basketball and stay out of the way of
the adults that run the world. I never bought that. <br><br>When I
was a child, I used to, of course, be happy when my family would have
other families coming over to visit because they would bring their
children and I&rsquo;d have kids to play with. But after dinner, the
women would always end up in a group and they&rsquo;re talking women
talk, and my dad and his brothers and whoever else was there, all the
men, would go in the front room and smoke the cigars and have the
wine and talk men talk. <br><br>And so, my dad and my uncles
especially would always say: <I>Well, you kids go on out and play
ball,</I> and I would tell my uncle &ndash; because dad&rsquo;s
brothers were wonderful; I loved them all &ndash; and so I would tell
my uncles: <I>I don&rsquo;t want to go out and play ball. I want to
hear what you guys are talking about, because I&rsquo;m assuming if
you want me to go out and play ball that you&rsquo;re going to be
talking about something that you don&rsquo;t want me to hear. I&rsquo;m
real curious to hear what you want to talk about that you don&rsquo;t
want me to hear about.</I> <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And you used to say that to
them, I assume. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Yeah. So you were
incredibly precocious. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And so then, what they would do
is my uncle and my dad would say: <I>Well, we&rsquo;ll go out and
play, too,</I> you know, acting like: <I>Okay, we don&rsquo;t need to
talk about anything.</I> <br><br>And of course, all the kids would
now want to go out because my dad and my uncles are going to be
playing with us. So we would all go out to play ball because now the
adults were with us. And of course, about ten minutes into the game,
my dad would get tired because he works all day, so he&rsquo;s tired
and that kind of story. So he comes in, and then my uncles a few
minutes later would come in, but now the kids are all playing ball,
so now we&rsquo;re happy. <br><br>I see that today. The President of
the United States goes to the opening ballgame. He throws out the
first ball. That&rsquo;s Daddy throwing out the first ball for all
the kids to be there, and all the kids are watching their silly
ballgames. And then of course they would shoot into the audience of
the ballgames and you see the movie stars and big name politicians
there watching the game. <br><br>And I&rsquo;d think: <I>You know, I
know what that is. It&rsquo;s just the guys who are running the
planet want all the poor people &ndash; all the kids &ndash; to know
that we adults who are running the world, we&rsquo;re human like you;
we like to come out to the basketball game and see the ballgames.</I>
<br><br>It kind of makes everyone feel kind of happy that our
national leaders and our movie stars are like us &ndash; they love
the ballgames, too. I never fell for that. I know what&rsquo;s going
on. These guys couldn&rsquo;t care less, but it&rsquo;s just
politics. It&rsquo;s just, you know, go out and let the people see
that you are human like everyone else. I never bought it. <br><br>I
wanted to know about what these guys were talking about, two o&rsquo;clock
in the morning when everyone else is asleep. That&rsquo;s when these
guys talk. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Absolutely. Can you possibly feel comfortable
enough to share what you shared with us last night, about the meeting
with that very special person? The one... <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I know what
you&rsquo;re saying. I&rsquo;m just trying to think: <I>Am I
comfortable talking about it?</I> <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I understand. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 Well, let me go on, first, and lay some more foundation. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 All right. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; So it didn&rsquo;t take me very long to
figure out that so much of what is going on, humans are not being
told. We are not being told the real truth. <br><br>A couple of
things in particular I want you to know, and I want you to remember.
Nothing in this world &ndash; <I>nothing</I> &ndash; works the way
you think it does. There&rsquo;s always more to the story. <br><br>You
hear about some marriage breaking up and the husband did this, the
wife did that, and it&rsquo;s very obvious what happened. No, it&rsquo;s
not obvious what happened. There&rsquo;s a lot more to the story you
don&rsquo;t know. You don&rsquo;t know her background, her past. You
don&rsquo;t know his past. You don&rsquo;t know what was going on in
the family. You have no idea. So nothing is simple. This is why you
have courts. <br><br>So I found that nothing in this world operates
the way you think it does. Banks do not loan money. Governments are
not empowered to protect you. Police department is not there to serve
you. Institutions of higher learning &ndash; colleges and educational
institutes &ndash; are not there to educate you. <br><br>The entire
superstructure of civilization in the Western world is a combination
of brilliantly put-together and well-planned schemes to direct the
minds of the people in such a way as to serve their masters. And I&rsquo;ve
known that for a long time. <br><br>One of the biggest tools in the
hands of the masters who run this world is Hollywood. Hollywood is an
incredible story. <br><br>I&rsquo;ve said this, and maybe many
hearing me now have heard me say this, but I&rsquo;ll say it again &ndash;
that the white man&rsquo;s establishment comes from Europe. And
northern, southern... well, all four: north, east, south and western
Europe, even at the time of the Roman Empire and before, that whole
section of Europe that we call the center for the white man&rsquo;s
presence on the Earth was quite literally ruled over &ndash; ancient
Europe was ruled over &ndash; by a priesthood called the Druids.
<br><br>The Druids were the ministers, the priests, the judges, the
lawyers; they were the religious leaders. <br><br>So it was
priesthood that dominated Europe. It still does. Europe is still a
Druidic country, and America is a Druidic country. Unless you
understand the Druidic system, then you&rsquo;re never going to
figure out what&rsquo;s going on in America and England. <br><br>One
of the most important symbols in the Druid system was a magic wand,
like Merlin the Magician with a magic wand? And also, the orchestra
leaders and conductors always have a magic wand and you had better
play to the tune of the master. He directs you to play and he directs
you to stop with the magic wand, so you&rsquo;re dancing to his
music. Okay? <br><br>Magic wands were always made out of the wood of
a Holly tree. It&rsquo;s made out of Holly wood. Hollywood is a
Druidic establishment and the symbols, the words, the terms, the
stories, are <I>designed</I>. <br><br>Think about it. Think about how
Hollywood does what they do. I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re evil,
I&rsquo;m just explaining how Hollywood works. <br><br>You have,
first of all, a story, so somebody has to write the story. All right?
So now you&rsquo;ve got a story. Now you have to give it to a
screenwriter, who&rsquo;s going to adapt that story into a screenplay
because you can&rsquo;t just tell the story, you have to design it to
be a movie. <br><br>Now once you do that, then you&rsquo;re going to
have to hire the actors &ndash; very important: <I>actors</I> --
because you&rsquo;re going to need people to act the part. It doesn&rsquo;t
mean that they actually have human feelings. No, no, they&rsquo;re
being paid to <I>act like</I> they care, to act like they love
someone. It&rsquo;s an act. <br><br>And so you pay actors to act out
the part that the screenwriters have written, and you want to make
sure the actors do it just right, so you have to have a director and
he&rsquo;s going to direct everything you say and do the way he wants
it said. <br><br>Then you have, of course, the producer and he&rsquo;s
also subjected to the executive producer who&rsquo;s producing the
money, and so all of this is a whole system of putting together a
system of a story that tells you a story. It causes you to think in
terms of what you just saw, so that people go out from the movie and
think in their minds: <I>This is the way you normally would react to
a situation, the way that the guy in the movie did.</I> <br><br>And
so that&rsquo;s why today in the Western civilization, especially in
the West, our ability to work with each other and live together as
humans is so screwed up, because we&lsquo;ve been watching so much
television and so many movies and so much silliness coming out of
Hollywood; so much violence, and sex, and drugs, and all the rest of
it, that people have no idea in the world how to <I>live</I> anymore.
They&rsquo;ve lost their humanity. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay, so you&rsquo;re
saying that in many ways Hollywood movies and television are actually
sort of doing behavior modification on people... <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Precisely. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;...to get them to behave in certain ways, to
think is socially acceptable and then people actually go out and they
act the way they&rsquo;re &rdquo;supposed&rdquo; to act, rather than
the way they really feel in any human situation. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Exactly. Precisely. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So it cements the social structure.
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I do understand that.
Would you also talk about how movies are revealing the Illuminati
agenda? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh God yes! What a story that is! Absolutely.
Even more so than you know, even more so than you suspect. <br><br>I
have been looking at one subject for, well, since 1967. Let me
preface this: In Glendale, California, in 1967 I was researching
Communism for a lecture I was going to give and I went to a <I>World
Book Encyclopedia</I> and there was the picture of the national coat
of arms of the Soviet Union and the Soviet flag. That was in &rsquo;67.
<br><br>Well, I started speaking to small, little groups in &rsquo;60,
so for seven years, I&rsquo;d already been talking to little mom and
pop groups, and little library rooms, and little bookstores, and all
that kind of thing. But it was in &rsquo;67 that I came across a
symbol which was the national coat of arms of the Soviet Union. <br><br>I
was familiar by that time with a particular term that the Communists
have used, the Nazis have used, the British have used, the Americans
have used, and so when I saw this symbol and the explanation for the
symbol in the <I>World Book Encyclopedia</I>, it finally hit me that
something is going on, on a massive, enormous scale around the world.
<br><br>For the first time I saw it in the Soviet national coat of
arms, because it was using the same words and terms that Hitler had
used, the Nazis had used, that the fascists had used in Italy. <br><br>And
now as I began to look, the people of India used it; the governments
around the world are using the same symbol, so I knew that I had
stumbled upon something of profound significance. I didn&rsquo;t know
what it was, but I already knew, I had a gut feeling that something
is really big going on, on the Earth, and the Soviet national coat of
arms was what triggered my catching that. <br><br>BILL RYAN (BR):&nbsp;
When you talked about the symbols there, that reminded me how much of
your work is about the interpretation of symbols. Somebody mentioned
to me that you were actually the model for the symbologist that was
played by Tom Hanks in the movie <I>The DaVinci Code</I>. Can you say
anything about that? Is it true that that was based on your work and
your personality and your research? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m not
in a position to say for sure, because I&rsquo;m not privy to how
they came up with what they did in the movie. All I will say that is
for sure and provable is that in 1991, I think it was, I did a
presentation that was videotaped in the Pasadena area at a bookstore
&ndash; and the video is out all over the world. It&rsquo;s called
<I>The Basic Slide Presentation.</I> <br><br>In that &ndash; that was
back in 1991, Pasadena &ndash; I was introduced as an expert on
secret societies and occult emblems and symbols of religion and
government. <br><br>I walked up onto the stage, and it was a slide
presentation that I was doing, and so I had the slide projector on,
and the slide that was being projected on the screen &ndash; I left
it on even before I started just to have a picture for people to see
when they came in &ndash; so the slide projector was already on. The
picture that was on the screen was the back of the dollar bill, the
pyramid on the back of the dollar bill. When I walked up onto the
platform, I walked in front of the screen, so now it was being
projected on me. <br><br>BR:&nbsp; That was in the movie. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And
then I started pointing to the symbols on the dollar bill [Kerry
laughs] and explaining the emblems or words. That&rsquo;s exactly the
same scene that&rsquo;s in the movie. <br><br>BR:&nbsp; I remember it. It
was very dramatic, if you recall. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. Go back and get
my <I>Basic Slide Presentation</I> back in &rsquo;91 and it&rsquo;s
the same identical thing. <br><br>BR:&nbsp; Imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Right, I guess. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t
get a check or anything. [laughs] And then of course in 1992 or &rsquo;93,
something like that, I did a video called <I>Matrix of Power</I> in
which I talked about how the world is being manipulated behind the
scenes by occult or magical symbols and words that are deceiving
civilization, deceiving people. Then later on a movie comes out
called <I>Matrix</I>. But I&rsquo;ve been talking about this, you
know, this subject for many, many years before. <br><br>Now, one
thing a lot of people do not know is that I was going around, it can
be told now, but I was going around to studios in the &rsquo;70s and
in the early &rsquo;80s. Especially in the &rsquo;70s, I was going
around to all the motion picture studios at nighttime. Working-class
people in the studios would have me come in and do a presentation &ndash;
a slide projector, just a little Mickey Mouse operation, slide
projector, throw up a screen, and I would give lectures on Bible
codes, Knights Templars, secret societies, and those kind of arcane
subjects. <br><br>Many times I would give lectures like that to just
the working-class people of the studio and then sometimes we would
rent some office within the studio lot where I could go and sit and
talk with a bunch of people who were working at the studio. I was
just having fun talking about things I enjoy. You know, they would
order beer and pizza, we&rsquo;d sit and talk, and I would do a two-
or three-hour slide presentation on Bible codes, secret societies.
<br><br>In &rsquo;66, late &rsquo;66 as I said before, I learned
about the Illuminati as such, and so I started giving lectures at the
studios on Illuminati; Masonic Orders, both the British Grand Lodge
and the American Freemasonry; the French and German Orders, and tying
them all into the secret societies that operate around the globe --
and also incorporating in those lectures, as I said, in the &rsquo;70s,
the subject of Illuminati, which I had gotten from Anthony Hilder&rsquo;s
records that were put out in 1966. <br><br>And so today I see, you
know, on television, on History Channel, and all kinds of movies from
Hollywood talking about Illuminati. <br><br>BR:&nbsp; This actually comes
from your research. It&rsquo;s percolated itself down into the
popular culture. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well I mean, if you just keep talking
for 48 years, somebody&rsquo;s going to finally hear you somewhere.
[laughs] <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s very possible that they were
actually filming and taping you at the studio. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well, I
know they did. Actually they were doing it, but it was like
individuals would have their cameras and would videotape and they
would audiotape. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; But even behind the scenes, there could
have been recording going on. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Who knows. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Yeah. I mean, obviously a lot of what you talked about has shown up
in plot-lines in screenplays, and then in movies. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh
yeah. Absolutely. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So maybe we can go back again to where
you got involved. You were talking about the Soviet Crest and maybe
we could pick up there. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. So this was in &rsquo;67.
1967 as I said, I&rsquo;m in Glendale, California. I was researching
the Communist movement, and so I went to the <I>World Book
Encyclopedia</I> and there in the <I>World Book Encyclopedia</I> was
a picture of the national coal of arms of the Soviet Union and the
communist flag. <br><br>I already understood the symbols of the
communist flag, but my eye caught that national coat of arms and I
saw in that symbol something I had seen the Nazis use [and] all the
great nations of the world have used. All the Presidents of the
United States in their Inaugural Addresses used the same words and
terms. All the senators and congressmen, when they&rsquo;re running
for office, use that same term, that same symbol. <br><br>So I knew I
had stumbled upon something of profound significance. I just didn&rsquo;t
know what it meant, but I knew it was important. This was in &rsquo;67.
<br><br>And so, since &rsquo;67 I have been researching this one
term, this one symbol, and the more I find on it, the more I&rsquo;m
amazed at how much there is out there on this one secret symbol that
nobody is aware that it&rsquo;s right in front of you. It&rsquo;s one
of those incredibly fantastic stories of something that is so awesome
in scope and it&rsquo;s sitting right in front of you and you never
saw it. That&rsquo;s how clever these guys are. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So what
are you talking about? We&rsquo;re going to put it on the screen.
It&rsquo;s two mountains and a rising sun. Is that right? <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 Right. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So what are the words and what does this mean?
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; But, lookit, just to be able to see it, which you will
be able to put into the video, but just to be able to see it is not
sufficient. You need about 25 or 30 years of research to understand
the <I>significance</I> of what you&rsquo;re seeing and what it
actually means. So you&rsquo;ll be able to show it and it will be
something of interest that people will pick up on, but believe me,
there&rsquo;s a bigger story yet. <br><br>So when you&rsquo;re
hearing the term <I>Illuminati</I> or the concepts of <I>secret
societies</I>, <I>occult orders</I> and all that kind of thing, it&rsquo;s
actually much bigger than you think. There is something far bigger
going on, on the Earth that most people are not aware of. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 Okay. The rising sun. Are we talking about the rising sun? Are we
talking about the rising of the New World Order? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
right. Exactly. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re also talking about something
else, aren&rsquo;t we? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yes. That&rsquo;s right.
Something very big. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Something more occult even than
that. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Something that goes all the way back into B.C.,
back into the ancient world. Zecharia Sitchin and I have talked about
this. At one time I was in business with Zecharia Sitchin. I helped
send him to different countries and we were going to do a television,
a 13-week mini-special I was going to do with Zach. <br><br>Zecharia
Sitchin has been my dear friend, and a brilliant man, and I was so
impressed with him [that] I talked him into signing a contract with
me to do a 13-week mini-series for television. Unfortunately, the
attorneys and the people who were financing the project for me, at
the last minute, after we had already shot like five different
countries and we were almost through, they pulled the plug on the
whole project. So it wasn&rsquo;t Zach&rsquo;s fault, it wasn&rsquo;t
my fault. It was the people financing it, they faltered. <br><br>But
I&rsquo;ve had a lot of opportunities to talk to Zecharia about
things that I&rsquo;m interested in, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot
talking to him in private, which will, unfortunately, have to stay
private. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. So you&rsquo;re not able to tell anything
about something that he told you that was actually very significant.
JM:&nbsp; No, it&rsquo;s just that the symbol I&rsquo;m talking about is on
the national coat of arms of the Soviet Union, so I would say anyone
who&rsquo;s interested in this, look at the symbols on the national
coat of arms and <I>study</I> it. Don&rsquo;t just look at it, but
look at all the implications of it and then follow the others
pictures that I have, that I will give you. Each one&rsquo;s a step
closer, and another step closer to it, and it keeps going. I think
there&rsquo;s about six or seven pictures. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. But it
also links up with the Japanese, the use of the red sun; also the sun
that was in Obama&rsquo;s Inauguration in the background. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 Exactly. <br><br>DAVID WILCOCK (DW):  What about in Pittsburgh? The
G-20 summit? It&rsquo;s like a grid? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I know. <br><br>DW:&nbsp;
 That&rsquo;s the same thing. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; But isn&rsquo;t there some
occult significance to the Sun itself? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Of course there
is. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And are we talking about something to do with the
Anunnaki as well, and their agenda? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yes, yes,
absolutely. That&rsquo;s exactly what it&rsquo;s about. There is a
hidden agenda that&rsquo;s been in operation on this Earth for
thousands of years. And see, I&rsquo;m at a disadvantage because I&rsquo;m
trying to explain something to an audience who have not been where
I&rsquo;ve been and seen what I have, and so I&rsquo;m having a
difficulty trying to legitimize what I&rsquo;m saying if you haven&rsquo;t
seen what I&rsquo;ve seen, and so... <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. Well, that&rsquo;s
part of the purpose of the interview. I mean, we are Camelot, we have
a lot of background information already on our site, as you know, and
so in many ways the people that are watching this, they&rsquo;ll have
been already educated, if they weren&rsquo;t to begin with, by
Camelot, by the other people that have come before you. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
I understand. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; But I think it&rsquo;s very significant
that we&rsquo;re talking now and I think that what we&rsquo;ve
touched on here is like, this is the beginning of a revealing that
most people are not aware of. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yes. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And
obviously you&rsquo;ve got that story. Okay? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I tell you,
no matter how well prepared and how well-read you are, I will
guarantee you you&rsquo;ve not heard this story. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay.
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; I have a story no one&rsquo;s heard, and I&rsquo;ve been
looking at it for some... since &rsquo;67, so we&rsquo;re talking
about, how many years is that? &rsquo;67 to 2007? That&rsquo;s what,
40 years? <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Yes. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Yeah.
Absolutely. And when did you actually stumble on the final... I feel
like in a sense you have the full meaning of it at this stage. I
think that perhaps you have that full meaning, so I&rsquo;m asking
you, in a sense, when did you arrive there? How many years ago did
you actually get to the... <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I think probably somewhere in
the mid &rsquo;90s it began to really dawn on me. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay,
yeah, and <I>dawn</I> has something to do with it. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s right. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re also talking about&hellip;
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re talking about an ancient, ancient story that
has been... <br><br>KC:&nbsp; The <I>Golden Dawn. </I>We&rsquo;re talking
about the<I> Golden Dawn</I> and the information there. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Absolutely. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; But what...? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Much further back.
The <I>Golden Dawn</I> was just one more step in a continuing flow of
a particular idea, and as it moves into the last days of the world
that we&rsquo;re living in, we&rsquo;re now entering into a <I>new
dispensation</I> &ndash; I choose that term &ndash; dispensation of
time in which this symbol is going to be everywhere. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And [sighs] I would like to be able to give like a
two-and-a-half to three-hour presentation just on this one symbol.
<br><br>A rather successful motion picture producer and I were
talking about doing a movie. After I gave him some of the
information, he called it, <I>Let&rsquo;s call the movie The Symbol,</I>
and then we talked about it and said: <I>Well, maybe</I> <I>The
Hidden Symbol.</I> I have the contract and here&rsquo;s the movie
that we want to do and we&rsquo;ll call it <I>The Symbol</I> or <I>The
Hidden Symbol.</I> <br><br>That never got done, for all kinds of
reasons. But then I see the new movie coming out with Dan Brown, <I>The
Hidden Symbol</I>? <br><br>And I&rsquo;m thinking: <I>These guys who
are smart, intelligent and Hollywood, they are either knowledgeable
on this symbol and are releasing it slowly but surely, OR there&rsquo;s
some kind of an understanding going on that people are starting to
look at symbols more now and beginning to put the pieces together,
like I&rsquo;ve been doing for 48 years, and now they are beginning
to perceive what I&rsquo;m talking about.</I> But they haven&rsquo;t
got there yet. <br><br>And so it&rsquo;s a form of professional
jealousy. I would like to be the one that presents my work before
Warner Brothers gets ahold of it from somebody else. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Exactly. I mean, here&rsquo;s your opportunity. So anything you hold
back at this point, I mean, really you do so at your own risk, in a
sense. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I understand. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Because this is an
opportunity and we are really coming close to the juncture &ndash; I
mean 2012 and beyond &ndash; where this agenda is really coming to
the fore. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I know and it&rsquo;s just incredible,
watching it. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s amazing that you&rsquo;ve been
watching this thing with full awareness as each step, each
roll-out... <br><br>JM:&nbsp; For 40 years I&rsquo;ve been watching it
coming. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And so, take us down the path. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; All
the Presidents of the United States &ndash; all of them &ndash; have
used the same terms, from George Washington. The terms he used and
the things he said were taken directly from the ancient prehistoric
world of the Anunnaki, the ancient gods, from the ancient Sumerians,
Babylonians, Phoenician-Canaanites, ancient Greece, ancient Rome.
They all the used the same word and the same term. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay,
what is the term? What are the terms? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; The term is <I>The
Dawn of the New Day</I>. And the concept of <I>The Dawn of a New Day</I>
is the Sun rising between two mountains. <br><br>This goes back to
the beginning of Christianity in the 4th century when Constantine
codified the religion called Christianity. Christianity is nothing
more than... In my opinion, Christianity is the most popular
rendition of the ancient cult story, this ancient thing that for
thousands of years has been hidden from people, but the masters of
the world, the kings and rulers, have all understood. <br><br>Christianity
is telling you the same story, but you don&rsquo;t see it, so people
are fixated on Jesus and on his ministry and never for a moment
suspect that the entire story is the same ancient story that&rsquo;s
been told by so many ancient cultures and is today part of the New
World Order, Illuminati, Masonic Orders around the Earth. <br><br>The
entire superstructure of Western civilization has bought into this
most ancient story, never realizing for a moment what they&rsquo;re
doing. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. I have some clues along the lines of this,
and I have to say you&rsquo;re really talking about the rise of the
Son of Anu [Anubis]. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Exactly. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know if it&rsquo;s Marduk, but it&rsquo;s Orion, the son of Orion.
Can you tell us? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Now you&rsquo;re getting close. That&rsquo;s
right. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. This is him coming back, actually, to sit
on the throne and to rule the world. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Mm hm. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
And so maybe you can sort of start to paint that picture. Now, is he
coming in a craft? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well, don&rsquo;t know. Maybe. I
would not be a bit surprised if they&rsquo;re already here, just
waiting. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t have to
come, they&rsquo;re already here. That&rsquo;s what Steven Spielberg
said in his <I>War of the Worlds.</I> They&rsquo;re not coming;
they&rsquo;re already here and they popped up from out under the
street. Symbolically what Hollywood and Steven Spielberg are saying:
<I>They&rsquo;re right under your feet. They&rsquo;re right under the
surface.</I> <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Well, according to Bob Dean, they&rsquo;re
walking the halls of the Pentagon. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be a
bit surprised. Yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So we certainly have witness
testimony in that area. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to do a
presentation on this very soon. I already have about a 3-hour
presentation all ready to go that I want to explain it. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Okay, but this ruler coming to kind of take control, is this a
positive thing in your view or a negative thing? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I think
negative. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I think very negative, but
the whole world is sucking it up. They love it, never realizing the
full implications of what&rsquo;s being said. <br><br>It&rsquo;s like
some kids going into Hollywood, you know, leaving home and they&rsquo;re
going to Hollywood. They&rsquo;re going to be in the motion picture
capital of the world, never realizing that on the streets of
Hollywood and this city is not some place for an innocent kid. You&rsquo;re
getting yourself involved with something you have no idea in the
world how bad it really is. <br><br>I think that so many people have
bought into the different religions orders &ndash; Jehovah&rsquo;s
Witnesses, Christadelphia, Worldwide Church of God [and the] Mormon
Church. All of these are part and parcel of a larger world movement
that&rsquo;s been planned for a long time. <br><br>And where the
world, especially in the Western world, I&rsquo;m talking mostly in
the Western world because the Arabic world is also heavily involved
in this, but that&rsquo;s a different subject. But for the moment,
Western Civilization is just going over the wall with this thing.
Everybody has bought into it. You&rsquo;re seeing it in politics...
<br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. It&rsquo;s in the Japanese flag, so there has to
be some acquiescence there, with China and all. You know. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 Oh yeah. Absolutely. They&rsquo;re all using it and they&rsquo;re
all buying into this whole new order of the world, never realizing
what this actually implies. <br><br>You know, the very term <I>Novus
Ordo Seclorum </I>on the back of the dollar bill? That comes from the
Roman poet, Virgil. In ancient Rome there was a poet that was
appointed by the court of Rome to write poetry for Caesar, and of
course, if you&rsquo;re going to write poetry for Caesar, you want to
write something nice that he will like. <br><br>So Virgil in one of
his poems called <I>Aeneid</I>, wrote about the time when there would
come a great world ruler in the seat of Caesar, but this ruler would
be awesome in power, to be far more than any man could ever be. That
time when he would come, the Sun would rise on the <I>Novus Ordo
Seclorum</I>, a New World Order, and when that one comes, it would be
the beginning of a whole new civilization. The term that Virgil used
in Latin was <I>Novus Ordo Seclorum</I>, a new order of the world.
<br><br>Now, when you get into the subject, now you have to get to
the Hebrew and Jewish religion, where Judaism comes from, where
Christianity comes from, where Islam actually comes from, and trace
back like Zecharia Sitchin has done for us. And he&rsquo;s not the
only one; there are many who have written on this subject of the
ancient world and the symbols and words and terms and theology that&rsquo;s
come down to us for thousands of years. <br><br>There&rsquo;s just so
much we could talk about that without pictures, without the ability
to show the audience what I&rsquo;m talking about, it&rsquo;s a
little difficult. But I&rsquo;m going to be doing a series on it.
I&rsquo;ve already got it pretty well... <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. But
basically we&rsquo;re talking about the beginning of a reign with
this king, who is a Sun [and/or Son] and he&rsquo;s basically going
to take control of the world. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Right. Of the whole Earth.
<br><br>KC:&nbsp; Yeah. And... <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And the destiny of the human
family &ndash; period. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. And do you know where that
destiny is headed? In other words, what is unique about this Son
[and/or Sun] and his proclivities, his point of view, where he&rsquo;s
coming from that&rsquo;s different from what we&rsquo;ve had before?
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; I think that the agenda of this one who is to come is to
mutate the human race. I believe that is what is the agenda, is to
mutate the human race &ndash; not necessarily evolution, though I
believe that evolution has its place in the world. <br><br>I think
that there are things which do evolve. And I&rsquo;m not talking
about man coming from monkeys because, obviously, man did not come
from monkeys -- man is evolving <I>into monkeys</I>. [Kerry laughs]
And so, that&rsquo;s the problem. There is a place for evolution, but
that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about. <br><br>This ancient
story, coming from the ancient and prehistoric world, has dominated
<I>all</I> the cultures of the world. What that implies, I believe,
is there&rsquo;s going to be some kind of a mutation of the human
race in order to take the human family on the Earth to a new style of
life in the universe. <br><br>And so, what will be lost will be your
<I>humanity</I>, your ability to show love and kindness to other
people. There will be no room for that. Emotions &ndash; there will
be no room for emotions. There will be no room for the American
system of freedom, liberty, and justice for all. That&rsquo;s gone.
That&rsquo;s out. There will be no more freedom, liberty, and justice
for all. No more family love, no more humanity, man reacting to man.
No. All of that&rsquo;s going to be gone. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t
you also saying, though, that there is a race of humans being...
actually that this isn&rsquo;t going to start in the future, that
it&rsquo;s already started. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh yeah. It&rsquo;s already
started. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; The preparation, the genetic modification of
the human, actually, behind the scenes. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yes. You know,
in the Book of Genesis in the Bible, the Old Testament in Genesis 18,
the 18th chapter -- I did a video on this -- it talks about Abraham
and Sarah, the prophet Abraham. It says that three men &ndash; in
Genesis 18; go back to read it yourself &ndash; it says that three
men come walking up into the camp. <br><br>Abraham went out and
greeted the three men and asked them to stay for dinner and they said
no, they were on their way to other business and did not have time to
stop. It says that Abraham insisted that they stay at least to have
something to eat and then they could go, and they agreed, so they
said: <I>All right, make it quick, we&rsquo;ll stay for something.</I>
<br><br>And so the Bible says in Genesis 18 that Sarah, his wife,
fixed dinner for them, they sat under a tree, had dinner with
Abraham. Then it says after dinner, two of the men got up and left to
go on about their business, but the one that stayed was the Absolute
Creator God, the one who had created the human creature. He sat with
Abraham, having dinner under the tree, and then gave prophecies to
Abraham and then got up and left. Now that&rsquo;s in Genesis 18.
<br><br>First of all, my question is: <I>Wait a minute.</I> It says
there were three <I>men</I> and the three <I>men</I> come up and had
dinner with Abraham. <br><br>And then in Genesis 19, the following
chapter, it says that those two<I> men</I> who had gotten up earlier
and left were the two<I> angels</I> that went into Sodom and
Gomorrah. It says that when these two <I>angels or men</I> went into
Sodom and Gomorrah, the homosexuals saw these guys, these two men,
and thought that they were absolutely handsome, beautiful,
good-looking men, and they attracted the homosexuals. Go read it in
Genesis 19. <br><br>But that tells me, if those were the same two men
that were with Abraham having dinner, the scripture said they were
absolutely handsome, good-looking, handsome <I>men</I> and <I>God the
Creator</I> is still sitting under the tree with Abraham having
dinner. And it says GOD in all capital letters. The Creator of the
human race is there with Abraham. <br><br>So I&rsquo;m just saying
that I&rsquo;m sure that there are spiritual interpretations of all
this, but I think there is a legitimacy about the story that when we
read in Genesis where God walked with Adam and Eve in the cool of the
evening, the word in Hebrew &ndash; God <I>walked</I> with Adam &ndash;
that Hebrew word means <I>you can hear a footstep stepping on leaves,
you can hear the footsteps. </I><br><br>That&rsquo;s what the Hebrew
word means. So we poetically say: <I>Well, God probably was with Adam
and Eve spiritually.</I> No, no. The word in Hebrew says: <I>God
walked with Adam. You can hear his footsteps on the leaves.</I> <br><br>All
of this implies in the Old Testament that whoever created us looked
like us and that&rsquo;s why the scriptures says, God says: <I>Come,
let us make man in our image after our likeness.</I> That&rsquo;s in
Genesis One; Genesis One and Two, both. <br><br>Many years ago I
talked with Rabbi Marvin Antelman. Rabbi Marvin Antelman from
Massachusetts was a dear friend of mine. I think he&rsquo;s still
alive today in the Knesset in Israel. But he and I used to talk long
hours, and I asked him once about that scripture: <I>Come, let us
make man in our image after our likeness.</I> <br><br>He said both
Jews and Christians misunderstand that scripture because they gloss
over it too quickly. Most people think that when they read that
scripture that God is saying: <I>Come, let us make a creature and we
will call him man.</I> <br><br>Well, first of all you gotta ask who
is God talking to? Himself? He&rsquo;s saying come let <I>us</I>.
Who&rsquo;s <I>us</I>? So he says: <I>Come, let us make man in our
image after our likeness.</I> <br><br>He said no, that&rsquo;s not
the way to translate it correctly. He&rsquo;s saying the correct
understanding is God is saying to someone: Come, let us make man in
<I>our</I> image, after <I>our</I> likeness &ndash; not make man. No,
no. Man&rsquo;s already here. But come, let us re-form, mutate man.
Let us make man in <I>our</I> image, after <I>our</I> likeness. And
later on in Genesis it says: <I>Man has now becomes as one of us. </I>Now
he looks like us. <br><br>So if that is true, then that means today &ndash;
and I am totally convinced that this is the case &ndash; we have
entities here from somewhere else; angels, gods, whatever you want to
call them. Zecharia Sitchin called them Anunnaki. <br><br>But I am
totally convinced for my own self that there are alien life forms
here who look like humans and yet they&rsquo;re not fully human.
<br><br>And of course in Genesis we&rsquo;re told that there&rsquo;s
a world of difference. We understand in the Book of Genesis there&rsquo;s
a world of difference between an angel and the Sons of God. Sons of
God are not angels and angels are not Sons of God &ndash; totally
different concept. Totally different words. <br><br>Sons of God are
spirit entities or entities from somewhere who look and have physical
bodies and look like humans. They are called Sons of God, while
angels are spirit entities. <br><br>So we&rsquo;re told in the Bible,
again going back to Genesis, that the Sons of God were messing around
with women and got them pregnant. Well, I kind of figured that these
Sons of God, their plumbing worked the same way, so therefore, they
could get women pregnant. And I cannot imagine a woman being talked
into bed by some hideous creature from another world, but I can see
it if it&rsquo;s a handsome, good-looking man. Well, that&rsquo;s
what the Bible said, even the homosexuals said they were beautiful,
handsome men. <br><br>All of this I&rsquo;m bringing out as Biblical
reference for my conclusion, that I think Zecharia Sitchin is right.
I think other people who have written about this same subject are
right, that there are in fact entities here &ndash; life forms here &ndash;
that have come here from somewhere else. Maybe they were the
originals, and they are today, in my humble opinion, the people who
are running this planet. It would not surprise me a bit. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Are these the Nephilim? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know. They could
be the Nephilim because not all the Nephilim died at The Flood. A lot
of Christians will tell you all the Nephilim died in the Flood. No,
that&rsquo;s not what the Bible says. It says that there was one of
the Nephilim lived through The Flood. His name was Og of Bashan. Og
of Bashan was one of the Nephilim and he lived through The Flood and
could reproduce and reproduce more like himself. <br><br>We know that
there have been skeletons found way down in the Earth around the
world that are far bigger than we humans are today. Some of them are
16 feet long, some of them 20 feet long, 12 feet long. So I&rsquo;m
sure that there have been extraterrestrial, for lack of a better
term, extraterrestrial life forms who have come here who <I>we</I>
look like <I>them</I>. <I>They</I> don&rsquo;t look like <I>us</I>.
They created us in their image and likeness. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay but
this new sort of ruler, is the Sun [and/or Son] of God. Right? He&rsquo;s
going to be ruling, in other words, between these two mountains. Now
I&rsquo;m wondering what the mountains are symbolizing. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Yeah. Very good. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Because the mountains... are we talking
about the Soviet Union and the U.S.? Are those the mountains where
the Sun [and/or Son] is going to rise between those two mountains? Or
are we talking about planets? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I think that we&rsquo;re
talking about something deeper, the implications being that in all of
the ancient world there was always a concept, and theologies of all
the ancient cultures of the world used it, of twin towers, twin
things, twin churches, twin towers. That&rsquo;s why that whole thing
about in New York, twin towers? <br><br>That is in-your-face if you
understand the symbolism of twin towers in the Roman Empire, and the
Grecian empire, in Sumeria, Babylonia. Especially in Egypt &ndash;
they always had the two obelisks. They always had the two towers,
always. So there is a very powerful significance to the concept of
twin towers, very important symbolism. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. So we&rsquo;ve
got twins and we&rsquo;ve got basically Gemini, and how does that
work in? Are we talking about, I don&rsquo;t know, when this
so-called god was born? Are we talking about the constellation when
his rule will begin? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I think it will probably be when he
comes into power, this will be his symbol. His symbol will be the sun
rising between the mountains of the East. Zecharia Sitchin talks
about that. <br><br>Many of the books on the ancient Middle Eastern
religions have pictures of Shamash; the Hebrew god is Shamash,
meaning the Sun rising between the mountains of the East. That goes
all the way back to the cuneiform pictures, the clay pictures from
Sumeria and Babylonia or from Iraq, pictures of the god rising
between two mountains. Again, it&rsquo;s very difficult for me to
make this intelligently understood, because I don&rsquo;t have the
pictures, and it would take me about three hours to lay the
foundation for this. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I understand. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; So I&rsquo;m
just giving you some brief glimpses into what I&rsquo;m going to be
doing soon on this video. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. Is this ruler... are we
talking about Marduk? Or is Marduk already here and this is somebody
who&rsquo;s coming after him? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure about
that. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; But again I would say it all
boils down to one thing in my mind &ndash; that the human race on the
Earth is being prepared, slowly but surely, in a scientific method
being applied to the human race to mutate the human race, to change
us from being what we are today to a creature that the Gods have in
mind, mutating again. Because if the Bible is correct, if Zecharia
Sitchin&rsquo;s correct and all the other writers on the subject are
correct... <br><br>BR:&nbsp; This is a real detective story here. I&rsquo;m
on the edge of my seat, thinking: <I>Wow, are we talking about the
return of the Anunnaki?</I> Is this connected with the Christian myth
of a Second Coming? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
This particular video is not really for, you know, people that are
just coming to the subject. This actually is for people who have...
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; A cursory understanding of all this. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; ...a
background and do understand and have possibly read Sitchin&rsquo;s
work, for example, and are up to speed with even David Icke&rsquo;s
work and our work. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Right. <br><br>BR:&nbsp; And who may have
been following you for many years because in recent interviews, for
example, on <I>Coast to Coast</I> for example, you hinted heavily
that there are things which you are not ready to say yet. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 Yes. <br><br>BR:&nbsp; And a lot of people will be watching this,
wondering whether this is the time and you&rsquo;ve chosen to tell
all. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. That&rsquo;s true. Yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; What we
have established here is that there is a very predominant symbol and
you&rsquo;ve talked about how it&rsquo;s permeated every aspect of
life and religion and that people are really not up to speed on what
it really means for the human race. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Absolutely. That&rsquo;s
right. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And this is sort of a stunning revelation for
many people that are listening to this. But I would like to say, what
we are seeing right now is a roll-out of an Illuminati agenda that
involves population reduction. What I&rsquo;m curious is whether or
not you can talk about how this agenda to do with the Son [and/or
Sun] coming to the throne of the world, if indeed this transpires,
the creation of a new race of humans... <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Right. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
...and how population reduction folds into that. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well, I
think if you&rsquo;re going to have a whole new race of humans; they
are <I>cultured</I>. That&rsquo;s why we refer to different races of
people as &ldquo;cultures&rdquo; and a culture is something under a
microscope, you know; it&rsquo;s like a bacteria. And so that&rsquo;s
what we are on the Earth &ndash; we are a culture. And somebody has
actually put us here as a culture, and is watching us grow, and we
have become a disease, because we&rsquo;re killing everything in our
path. <br><br>And so I think that whoever it is that has created us
had created us, I believe, possibly already knew that in the far
future, once this race is finally brought up to speed, and then we
can move it into the next plateau. This is what the Nazis were
talking about. This is what Wernher von Braun was talking about. The
Nazis were big on this subject and using the symbol and the term that
I&rsquo;m talking about, the symbol between the mountains of the
East. <br><br>England &ndash; interesting about this, is England has
always had a fixation on Egypt. England&rsquo;s big on Egypt. Go to
the British Museum and all these different museums. The English were
always big on Egypt, but the Germans were not. <br><br>The Germans
were always big on Iraq. That&rsquo;s what Germany was interested in
&ndash; Babylon. And the reason why, I think, is because the Nazis
and the German people in general, or at least the intelligentsia of
the German establishment, realized this story that I&rsquo;m trying
to explain has to do with Babylon. It has to do with Iraq. And I
believe that may be one of the reasons why the U.S. is in Iraq today.
<br><br>KC:&nbsp; Absolutely. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; It has something to do with
some... and I know this is true because I can prove that the symbols
which are being used by the U.S. government today in Iraq is exactly
the same symbols that I was telling you about that comes from the
Anunnaki, from the Phoenician-Canaanites, the Assyrians, the
Phoenicians, ancient Greece, ancient Rome, ancient Britannia, into
America. <br><br>The entire superstructure of civilization has been
using the same words and terms and symbols that are today dominating
in Iraq, but most people don&rsquo;t even know. They don&rsquo;t even
see it. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I understand. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hidden in
plain sight. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay, but there is a stargate in Iraq
that&rsquo;s fairly well known that Saddam Hussein... apparently they
had to get rid of him because he had found it and was able to control
it while he was in power. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So in
essence the U.S. is never... It&rsquo;s been my theory that the U.S.
is never going to leave Iraq because basically they have to man that
stargate. They have to have control of that stargate, which is where
it is <I>said</I> the Anunnaki will return, through that stargate.
Have you heard that theory? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well yeah, I have.
Absolutely. And one of my favorite speakers on that subject is
William Henry. William and I have been around the world together,
went to Egypt together. We talked a long time about stargates. I
understand the story. I didn&rsquo;t say anything about stargates.
That&rsquo;s William Henry&rsquo;s work that influenced me in that
direction. But I am aware that Hollywood is talking about stargates
and making movies about it. <br><br>I did a lecture series with Al
Bielek and Preston Nichols. I did two weekend seminars in which the
three of us spoke together back in Philadelphia, and I had some time
to sit and talk with Preston Nichols. Incidentally, I am highly
impressed with Preston Nichols. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; You
have to be highly impressed with that man when you sit and talk with
him because he is a very, very interesting man. He&rsquo;s got a lot
of very good information on the kind of thing I&rsquo;m talking about
in private with him and he was enlightening me to some of the things
I&rsquo;m seeing and saying. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s heavily
involved in the Montauk story. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Absolutely. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
And the Philadelphia Experiment being the early precursor of that,
and then also time travel, which is where Montauk was headed. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 Exactly. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And then you get into the stargates and so on.
And this has something to do with letting in &ndash; I&rsquo;m
theorizing here, so I want you to help me &ndash; but my
understanding with the Montauk Project was that there were some
openings made in, not just the timeline, but also in space, so to
speak, where certain races were able to come in through an open door,
basically, that was created by the Montauk Project. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m wondering if that has to do with the
genetic engineering of our planet, such that they were coming in to
do a job. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well, yeah, I think all of that has some
validity. I don&rsquo;t know that much about the stargate itself
concept. I understand it, but I mean, that&rsquo;s not my subject,
but it plays into my subject, it&rsquo;s part of it, and it must be
important because Hollywood&rsquo;s making movies about it all the
time. They actually have television shows &ndash; <I>Stargate</I>. So
I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s something very legitimate about the
concept. <br><br>All I&rsquo;m saying is that when I was talking and
spent two weekends with Al Bielek and Preston Nichols and myself, I
was very impressed with both Al Bielek and Preston Nichols because,
in my opinion, sitting with them for hours on end and working with
them over the weekend; both of them are extremely interesting,
provocative people. I was having fun downloading all this stuff to
Preston and he&rsquo;s saying: <I>Yeah, well here&rsquo;s something
else you didn&rsquo;t see</I>. [Kerry laughs] And so, I have the
highest regard for him. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s wonderful to hear,
actually, because I do think there is great validity there and some
very important clues. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I think Preston Nichols is
absolutely sensational. I love everything, I loved... He was such a
gracious person, helpful, kind, courteous, and brilliant to sit and
talk with, so I love Preston Nichols. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I hear you. Now,
what about Zecharia Sitchin? When he talks about the Anunnaki, there
was a group of the Anunnaki that went to Mars, that left this planet.
And actually some of which, I guess, came from wherever the Anunnaki
came from, and never actually made it here. So there&rsquo;s a group
that kind of went back to Mars and then some that came from...
according to Sitchin, I&rsquo;m saying. <br><br>So what I&rsquo;m
wondering is, what was going on with Mars? We know that Hoagland has
gone down that road quite a distance, but I think that you&rsquo;ve
given him many of the clues and the basis for his work. <br><br>There&rsquo;s
something to do with... Now, I&rsquo;m not an expert on this, but I
do understand that the positioning of the Great Pyramid and the
significance with the association with Mars. And then, of course,
we&rsquo;re talking about Babylon, and Babylon and Mars are symbols
for the same thing. Isn&rsquo;t this right? And the <I>Whore of
Babylon</I>, and there&rsquo;s something going on there. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 Maybe you could talk about that a little bit, about Mars and the
significance with the Anunnaki and where that might be leading. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 And the very word <I>Cairo,</I> as you probably know, Cairo <I>means</I>
Mars. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Exactly. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Another word for <I>Mars</I>
is <I>Cairo</I>. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So what is going on with that? <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 Yeah. That is a subject which Richard is probably better suited to
talk about than I, because I really haven&rsquo;t looked at Mars over
and above the general kind of stuff he talks about. But I totally
believe for myself that Mars is inhabited, and I do believe that
there are probably humans like us there. <br><br>Quite a long time
ago I had a long conversation in Mesa, Arizona, with Virgil Armstrong
Postlethwaite. Virgil Armstrong and I sat in a restaurant in Mesa,
Arizona, many years ago and talked about the people who are on Mars.
<br><br>Virgil was a guy, from what I gather, was the man who came up
with the idea &ndash; he was a military/CIA operative &ndash; and
he&rsquo;s the guy that came up with the idea for Green Berets. That
was his idea, Green Beret, and he worked with the CIA. I loved
sitting and talking with Virgil Armstrong. But he brought out in that
conversation how there were many thousands of people, or more, like
us &ndash; humans like us &ndash; on Mars at that time. And I
wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; What year was this
that you were talking to him? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; This was probably mid
&rsquo;80s. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Amazing. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I would say &rsquo;85,
&rsquo;86, &rsquo;87, something like that. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. Well
that does dovetail also with our experience with our witness, Henry
Deacon. Arthur Neumann is his real name and he has come out under
that name recently, and said he&rsquo;s been to Mars. So I&rsquo;m
wondering if you have any information that&rsquo;s come to you about
jumpgates, about going between planets. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well, yes and
no. The only thing I have of any value is someone else&rsquo;s work.
I sat and talked with him and he is a very, very knowledgeable, very
legitimately... he worked for the United States Naval Observatory. He
was in charge of the Naval Observatory, and he just passed away just
recently. But his website is so extraordinary, the stuff he has on
that website, pictures of strange things found on Mars &ndash; and
they&rsquo;re not nebulous things; they&rsquo;re in your face. I
mean, those tubes, Plexiglas tubes. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Yes. Amazing. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 And lights in those tubes. There&rsquo;s just an enormous amount of
stuff he has on his website. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Well, our attention was
drawn to that by Henry Deacon as well, to those tubes, which is
fascinating. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. Right. You know, I always say I&rsquo;m
not the world&rsquo;s foremost authority on anything. If there&rsquo;s
any value in my person and my work, I would say this, that I have
been privileged to be in the company of extraordinary people doing
extraordinary work. I have been privileged to sit in their company
and be accepted by them and be able to learn things behind the scenes
that other people will never be privy to hear. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
it true, though, that you were told that you have a mission that is
going to come to the fore late in life? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 And that you might actually be there now? Do you want to tell that
story at all? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah, I suppose so. I mentioned this, I
think, on <I>Coast to Coast</I> once, but it was very quick because
George wants to hear all the stories as long as it&rsquo;s within a
minute and a half. [laughs] <br><br>KC:&nbsp; [laughs] We have longer than
that. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. [laughs] But when I was 19, I ended up in
Los Angeles &ndash; at 19 years old with seven bucks in my pocket,
incidentally. I had no idea where I was going, where I was. I ended
up in Los Angeles on a Friday night with seven dollars in my pocket.
You know, I was a stupid kid, but I lived through it. <br><br>Later
on, a couple months later, after I got a job and things were working
out for me, I was in North Hollywood one morning, on a weekend
morning, and I went into a restaurant. The place was crowded and
there was only one seat available and that was at the counter, so I
sat at the counter. There was a young girl sitting next to me, so we
started talking. <br><br>Come to find out she only lived about two
blocks from me and I only lived about two blocks from town, so she
had walked downtown and I had also. So we started hanging out
together. I&rsquo;d meet her downtown; we&rsquo;d hang out together.
This was back in &rsquo;59 and I was 19 years old. <br><br>When we
would walk home, I lived two blocks closer, so she had two blocks
farther to go, so I never knew exactly where she lived, but she knew
where I lived. One night she came over to my place and said: <I>My
dad wants to see you. He wants to talk to you.</I> <br><br>And of
course that put me on alert.

I
SAID:&nbsp; <I>I don&rsquo;t want to talk to your dad.</I> <br><br>SHE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>No, my father is a very important and interesting man. He
wants to talk to you. He&rsquo;s got something to tell you.</I>
<br><br>That sounded interesting, so I went with her, and when we
walked up to the house which was only a couple of blocks away, we
walked up to the house, just by chance, he happened to be coming out
of the house. <br><br>The moment I saw him, an incredible feeling
came over me of some kind of a euphoric, strange [and] wonderful
feeling that I got, being in his presence. It was as if I were in the
presence of a great prophet or some spiritual man. I felt it, and I
loved the feeling. I mean, I can&rsquo;t describe it, but I loved the
feeling. It was an other-world feeling. I noticed that he was very
much in control of himself; he knew exactly what he was doing. <br><br>He
motioned for us to come in. We went in and the girls sat on the floor
by the fireplace. They sat on the floor. He sat on one end of the
sofa, I sat on the other end of the sofa. The wife was in the
kitchen. I never did see her that whole night. <br><br>So we were
talking and he was, you know, he was asking me how I liked living in
California, and <I>do you have a job</I> and <I>how do you like your
job</I>, and just small talk. And I was beginning to feel a little of
the apprehension was going away. I was beginning to feel a little bit
better being in his company, but I knew there was something about
this guy that wasn&rsquo;t right, but I loved the feeling. <br><br>I&rsquo;m
19 years old, so I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m doing, but I&rsquo;m
just talking to this guy who&rsquo;s dazzling me with his presence of
mind and the presence he presented. <br><br>And so we&rsquo;re
talking about all kinds of things and then, when he felt that I was
sufficiently at ease, he said to me very nonchalantly, he said:
<I>Remember when you were eight years old back in Florida and your
father built the new back porch and your uncle helped him? And
remember, your dad used green lumber that smelled funny? And he built
the new back porch? You remember that?</I> <br><br>Tears started to
come to my eyes, and I didn&rsquo;t want to show tears in front of my
girlfriend, but he was scaring me because he was right and he knew
it. <br><br>AND HE SAID TO ME:&nbsp; <I>Well, did that happen or didn&rsquo;t
it?</I> <br><br>I SAID:&nbsp; <I>Yes, that happened.</I> <br><br>AND HE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>Also, one night when you were in bed, you got out of bed
and you went out on the back porch and you were looking at the Moon
and the Moon was full. Do you remember that?</I> <br><br>AND I SAID:&nbsp;
<I>Yes, I remember that.</I> <br><br>AND HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>And you were
picking the wood because it smelled funny. It was green lumber; it
smelled funny, and you were picking it with your finger. Remember how
you picked a piece of it, and you were smelling it and tasting it?</I>


AND
HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Remember doing that? </I><br><br>AND NOW I&rsquo;M
REALLY SCARED BECAUSE IT&rsquo;S FRIGHTENING TO ME AND I SAID:&nbsp; <I>Yes.</I>
<br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Well, did you do that, or didn&rsquo;t you?</I>
<br><br>I SAID:&nbsp; <I>Yes, I did.</I> <br><br>AND HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Well,
how would I know that? How would I know what you did?</I> <br><br>AND
I SAID:&nbsp; <I>I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;d know.</I> <br><br>HE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>I know because we were there. You just didn&rsquo;t see us,
but we were there watching you.</I> <br><br>AND I THOUGHT:&nbsp; <I>Well...</I>
[laughs] <br><br>AND HE SAID, BECAUSE HE COULD TELL I WAS NOT BUYING
IT:&nbsp; <I>Was I correct in what I said?</I> <br><br><I>Yeah.</I> <br><br>HE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>Well, how would I know if I wasn&rsquo;t there?</I> <I>We
were there.</I> <br><br>I SAID:&nbsp; <I>Who was we?</I> <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp;
<I>That&rsquo;s not important right now. What&rsquo;s important for
you to know is that you&rsquo;re in California, because we brought
you here. We brought you here to Los Angeles.</I> <br><br>I SAID:&nbsp;
<I>You brought me here?</I> <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Yeah.</I> <I>Why are
you here?</I> <br><br>I SAID:&nbsp; <I>I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m
here. I just had to come to Los Angeles.</I> <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>That&rsquo;s
right. We brought you here, </I>he said,<I> because what did you say
to God? You talked to God that night. The night you sat on the porch,
you said something to God. What did you say?</I> <br><br>I just sat
looking at him. <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>I&rsquo;ll tell you what you
said. You asked God to let you do something important with your life.
You wanted to do something of value and importance with your life.</I>
<br><br>And I was about eight or nine years old, right? <br><br>I
SAID:&nbsp; <I>Yes, that&rsquo;s what I said.</I> <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Well,
then we&rsquo;re going to give you an opportunity to do something
with your life now because you did ask.</I> <br><br>I&rsquo;m still
amazed, listening to him. <br><br>AND HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>What we have for
you to do will not happen until the later part of your life, and I&rsquo;m
not going to go into it right now.</I> <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>I&rsquo;m
not going to go into explaining it to you now; however, when the time
comes for you to do what we have brought you here to do -- you will
know what you have to do. By that time, you will be sufficiently
knowledgeable on who you are and what you&rsquo;re doing and where
you&rsquo;re going.</I> <br><br>AND HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>All you need to know
now is that we brought you here and that we will protect you wherever
it is that we put you.</I> <br><br>AND I ASKED HIM, I SAID:&nbsp; <I>I
still don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</I> <br><br>HE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>You don&rsquo;t need to, but one day, you will understand.
</I><br><br>AND HE SAID:&nbsp; <I> So I&rsquo;m here to start you on your
journey.</I> <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>I have a book I&rsquo;m going to
give you and I want you to read the book and that will begin your
journey.</I> <br><br>And he pulls it off the shelf and gives it to
me, and today you can still get that book in bookstores anywhere.
It&rsquo;s called <I>The Complete Works of Charles Fort.</I> [spells
name]. <br><br>Even in England there&rsquo;s a Fortean Society
dedicated to the work of Charles Fort. A fascinating book. It&rsquo;s
a monumental work, very thick book: <I>The Complete Works of Charles
Fort.</I> <br><br>And he opened the book indiscriminately, just put
his hand on the pages, because it&rsquo;s a very thick book, and he
opens a page and he reads a paragraph. He just opened the page and
reads a paragraph &ndash; he knew exactly what he was doing,
precisely what he was doing. I didn&rsquo;t know because it looked
like he just indiscriminately opened it, and he read a paragraph that
just blew me away. I was knocked out by what he&rsquo;d just read.

AND
I THOUGHT:&nbsp; <I>Wow! That&rsquo;s interesting.</I> <br><br>AND HE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>Oh yeah, the book is filled with that kind of thing. Let me
read you another one.</I> <br><br>He opened it up again and just
indiscriminately read something. Not indiscriminately! He knew what
he was doing. I&rsquo;m sure that he knew how to get your particular
attention. What would be very interesting to you, I may not even see.
But he knew how to play on my emotions, and he read about three
little paragraphs, one after the other, and each one &ndash; to me &ndash;
was absolutely mind-blowing. <br><br>I was fascinated with him, with
my new girlfriend, [laughs] and with this book.

AND
THEN HE SAID TO ME:&nbsp; <I>You&rsquo;ve always been interested in UFOs
and other-worldly things, right?</I> <br><br>AND I SAID:&nbsp; <I>Yes, I
have.</I> <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Would you like to see some UFOs up
close tonight? </I><br><br>AND I SAID:&nbsp; <I>I&rsquo;d love to.</I>
<br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Well come on. I can do that for you.</I> <br><br>So
I got up with him, and the two girls &ndash; my girlfriend and her
sister &ndash; the four of us came out in the yard. It was about
maybe midnight in North Hollywood, 1959, and he looks up into the sky
and starts inaudibly talking. His mouth is moving as if he&rsquo;s
talking to somebody, but you can&rsquo;t hear him. <br><br>And as I&rsquo;m
watching him standing there talking to the stars, I look over at my
girlfriend and she&rsquo;s looking at me.

AND
THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS LIKE:&nbsp; <I>Yeah, this is my father, that&rsquo;s
him. Told you he was strange, didn&rsquo;t I?</I> [laughs] And that
kind of thing. <br><br>And her sister was looking at me, and I could
tell what she was doing.

SHE
WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT:&nbsp; <I>How is he taking this?</I>

You
know, what&rsquo;s going on in my mind? [was] what the little one was
thinking, because she&rsquo;s seen this before. She wants to see how
I&rsquo;m going to react to this. <br><br>AND SO TEN HE LOOKS AT ME
AND HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>They said that they will be coming from Griffith
Park in just a minute. There&rsquo;ll be three of them and they&rsquo;ll
be coming from the Griffith Park area. They&rsquo;re going north and
they said that they&rsquo;ll be here in a minute for you.</I> <br><br>AND
I SAID:&nbsp; <I>Who&rsquo;s they? </I><br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>You&rsquo;ll
see.</I> <br><br>Within a couple of minutes, three beautiful
disk-shaped things, glowing, very faintly glowing, came over with no
sound whatsoever, in a triangle formation, came over and stopped
right above our heads and stopped. <br><br>And when they did, you
could see they were disk-shaped and it looked and appeared like it
was a pie cut in six or eight slices, and each slice was a different
color. What I remember distinctly is each color was like a laser
color: vibrant orange, vibrant pink, very vibrant colors, six or
eight colors on each one &ndash; and they were circulating, not so
fast as to blend the color, but circulating. They were beautiful.
They were about the size that the full Moon appears, so they&rsquo;re
not little lights. Full-Moon size. Three. <br><br>And I&rsquo;m
standing there looking at these gorgeous, beautiful, vibrant-color
things spinning, and colors, and no sound, and I was absolutely
mesmerized. I was just... I was enthralled by seeing this gorgeous,
beautiful display. <br><br>AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND HE&rsquo;S LOOKING
AT ME AND HE SAYS:&nbsp; <I>They&rsquo;re pretty, aren&rsquo;t they?</I>
<br><br>AND I SAID:&nbsp; <I>Yes. They&rsquo;re beautiful.</I> <br><br>AND
THEN HE LOOKS UP AND TALKS TO THEM. HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>They&rsquo;ve told
me to tell you that they&rsquo;re going now but they&rsquo;ll see you
later.</I> And they did. They started moving and they went out north.
<br><br>AFTERWARDS, WE WENT BACK IN AND I SAID:&nbsp; <I>What did I just
see tonight?</I> <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>That was us. We&rsquo;ve been
here for a long time, you just didn&rsquo;t know it.</I>
HE
SAID:&nbsp; <I> We picked you a long time ago when you were a small child.
We have something for you to do.</I> <br><br>AND I SAID:&nbsp; <I>I&rsquo;m
not understanding exactly.</I> <br><br>HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>You don&rsquo;t
have to. We will let you know what it is you&rsquo;re supposed to do
later on in life, but just go on with your life, don&rsquo;t worry
about it. Whatever you&rsquo;re supposed to learn, we&rsquo;ll see to
it that you learn, and when it is time for you do what we have for
you to do, you&rsquo;ll know. We&rsquo;ll let you know.</I> <br><br>After
that, I would go over there on the weekends to visit him and the
mother and the two girls, and we would go out to the desert
sometimes, go way out in the desert. The girls, with their mother,
would go for a walk, and he and I would walk in the desert, and he
would tell me about all the different alien lifeforms that are out
there, where they have come from, the ones that are here. <br><br>AND
HE TOLD ME:&nbsp; <I>You have enemies here. You have some very powerful
enemies here from other places that have come, and they know who you
are, and they know what you&rsquo;re going to do. So just be careful
in your life, but we&rsquo;ll protect you.</I> <br><br>I didn&rsquo;t
know what he was talking about. <br><br>And then one day I went over
to the house one morning, and the house was totally open, and they&rsquo;re
<I>gone</I>. Everything was packed and gone and the girl never told
me she was leaving. They&rsquo;d never come to tell me anything. They
were just gone. <br><br>Now that I look back on that experience, I
feel very secure in saying that he knew what he was doing.

HE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>I&rsquo;m starting you on your journey</I>, and he did. But
after that was done, then he moves on. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Do you believe
that you&rsquo;re at that place, that juncture where he was talking
about: <I>You&rsquo;re going to know...</I>? Has another message come
recently, or do you feel that you&rsquo;re right on the cusp of
something? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I feel along the beginning of something and
I&rsquo;m still not sure what all of this means. I&rsquo;m not sure
what it means. All I know is that I have some valuable stuff that&rsquo;s
going to really knock people out when they see it, but I don&rsquo;t
understand it fully yet. I&rsquo;ve talked with Zecharia about it.
I&rsquo;ve talked with many other speakers and people that are in the
speaking circuit that are knowledgeable on the subject. <br><br>But
my gut feeling... and incidentally, <I>gut</I>, G-U-T, is simply <I>God</I>
in Scandinavian. <I>GOD</I> is English, dog spelled backwards. But
God in, I think it&rsquo;s Sweden and Scandinavian countries, is
spelled G-U-T. So when you say you&rsquo;ve got a <I>gut feeling</I>,
that&rsquo;s God in Scandinavian. <br><br>But my gut feeling is that
I don&rsquo;t know the full picture yet, but I&rsquo;m getting there
now. After 48 years, I now know that my 48 years of study, day in and
day out, researching, reading, studying in libraries, was for a
reason, so that when the time would come, I would at least be
sufficiently educated in this dark subject which I&rsquo;m talking
about. At least I&rsquo;ve got some background in it now, to be able
to understand the significance of it. <br><br>And I think it&rsquo;s
really frightening to me. It actually is still rather frightening
because, being human, and watching the world, where it&rsquo;s
going... and I already know the symbols, the words [and] the terms. I
already know the history of the secret societies and the movements of
the bankers. <br><br>I&lsquo;ve sat and talked with all kinds of
people around the world; with Hakim, my dear friend Hakim, the
Hammite priest in Egypt -- we&rsquo;ve sat out by the Pyramids at
night and talked about the ancient Hammite priesthood, and I was
blessed in the Pyramid. <br><br>Hakim blessed me in the King&rsquo;s
Chamber; I laid in the sarcophagus and he did a whole prayer ritual
over me. I&rsquo;ve sat, like I said, for hours and talked with him
in private about things that have happened to me. <br><br>So I am
totally convinced that there&rsquo;s nothing special about me, but I
have been given the opportunity to be in the company of fascinating
people, to learn monstrously fascinating things, and ultimately, I
think that there is something for me to do. I&rsquo;m just not sure
yet what it is. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Do you happen to have an idea what race
this man was from? Do you have a planet? Do you have any idea? In
other words, do you think he was Anunnaki, do you think he was
Nordic, do you think he was Pleiadian? Do you have any idea? <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 No, not really, because he appeared to be an extraordinarily
ordinary-looking guy, just an ordinary guy you would meet. But when I
was in his presence, it was monstrous -- the <I>feeling</I>. I knew:
<I>This is not a normal man.</I> <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Did his children have a
different aura or a different feeling about them? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; No.
No. They seemed to be very ordinary, and the mother. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; But
didn&rsquo;t you tell me just recently, and correct me if I&rsquo;m
wrong, but I think you were out in the desert and you had something
happen out there. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh! Yeah! <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Very recently.
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh yeah. No no, that&rsquo;s a different story. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 Well, is it completely different? Is it possible that there was some
kind of...? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well... No, you&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;re
right. There could very well be some kind of a connection with what
happened to me just a few years ago and that original incident back
in 1959. Yes, very possible. <br><br>That was another extraordinary
experience. I&rsquo;ve had 36, what I call <I>peak experiences</I>. I
mean <I>monstrous</I> experiences. That was merely one. But yes, I&rsquo;ve
had some very interesting and emotionally-drenching experiences out
on the deserts of Nevada. <br><br>One thing I will tell you, which is
just my opinion: I am totally convinced for myself that at Area 51,
that base we call Area 51, there is no doubt in my mind that there
are extraterrestrial life forms there. No doubt in my mind about it
at all, because of what I&rsquo;ve personally seen and experienced
when I was at Rachel&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve had too many strange things
happen to me that were other-worldly, in-your-face, like one-on-one.
<br><br>And so there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that what I
experienced out there... We had an alien come in the mobile home. My
friend, Paul Tice, and my lady friend from Hawaii, Ivy -- all three
of us, an alien came in the bedroom. So there&rsquo;s no doubt in my
mind there&rsquo;s something really off the wall going on out there
at Area 51 that we are not aware of. But I&rsquo;ve had many
otherworld experiences out there, not just... <br><br>You know, I
can&rsquo;t stand it when people say that this is all high technology
of our government. No. I don&rsquo;t buy that for a minute. What I&rsquo;ve
seen with my own eyes, I don&rsquo;t buy it for a minute. If it has
anything to do with our government, then what I have actually
witnessed with my own eyes, if it has to do with the U.S. government,
then it means that the U.S. government is in league with
extraterrestrials, because what I saw is extraterrestrial in origin.
And what I&rsquo;ve experienced... KC:&nbsp; Thank you for that. That&rsquo;s
very, very valuable to hear you say that. <br><br>Can you talk about
the possibility of what these humans that are being created, what
their destiny might be? In other words, you say they might not have
feelings, etcetera, etcetera. And do you feel that perhaps this is
working in with your, sort of, destiny that they were talking about?
<br><br>Because these subjects we&rsquo;re talking about right here
and now... I actually went to Egypt with you and William Henry and
that group. I did have a short interview with you at that time. You
weren&rsquo;t willing to talk about that then. I think that now
you&rsquo;re much more willing. This message that you have seems to
be culminating in what you&rsquo;re saying, in this symbol that we
talked about in the beginning of this interview. Is it possible that
this is going to be the message: the unfolding of what you know?
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; My feeling is that the reason why I&rsquo;m here doing
what I&rsquo;m doing is because of this mutation which is being
<I>foisted</I> on the human race, it&rsquo;s being <I>forced</I> on
the human race. This change that the Masters of the Universe, so to
speak, have in mind for the human race is being <I>foisted</I> on us.
<br><br>And I believe &ndash; again, just my opinion &ndash; that
that&rsquo;s my part in this cosmic scheme or this cosmic play, is to
call people back to their humanity and let them know: <I>You&rsquo;re
being led down the garden path into something you don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s coming. You had better get back to your roots of being
human and start reestablishing your humanity</I> &ndash; <I>because
the human race is losing its humanity.</I> <br><br>The way we were
designed by the original creators was a beautiful thing. I mean, when
you look at children and little animals, you have to know that
whoever designed us designed humans and lifeforms to be beautiful, to
be charming, to be a beautiful thing, to live in a beautiful world
with children and gorgeous and beautiful things which uplift the
spirit. <br><br>But I am totally convinced that there is now on the
Earth, again for lack of a better term, <I>alien presence which are
the enemies of the human race,</I> and they are obviously enemies of
whoever the original creators of us, because of the things I&rsquo;ve
been told &ndash; that the people or the entities who created us, the
gods who created us, have enemies out there in the universe. <br><br>They
have come here to see what these gods are doing, what these aliens
are doing. And they&rsquo;re coming here saying: <I>Mm. I see what
they&rsquo;re doing. They&rsquo;re creating these creatures. Why
don&rsquo;t we move in?</I> &ndash; <I>like a gang. Why don&rsquo;t
we move in and take over and take this beautiful creation that these
gods have created and mutate it into what we want?</I> And so, to
mutate the whole human race away from their natural evolution of
society and humanity into a whole new kind of civilization. <br><br>I
think that that&rsquo;s probably what I&rsquo;m here to do, is to
call attention to the world that you&rsquo;re being misled by some
extraordinarily powerful, occult, mystical, other-world technology
that is changing the evolution of the human race from what it was
supposed to be in its creation, as opposed to where the dark powers
of the world are now leading the human race into a different world.
And what they have in mind for us, you don&rsquo;t want to know.
<br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; The people who are in power today in
this country and around the world have something in mind that you
have no idea in the world how bad it&rsquo;s really going to be,
because there will be no longer any place for freedom, intellectual
freedom, spiritual freedom, liberty, justice &ndash; none of that.
It&rsquo;s <I>gone</I>. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. But you are protected and
you&rsquo;ve been told this over and over again, and this person that
you met way back who sort of started you on your journey was also
part of a race that has been visiting here and is looking out for
you, in essence. You&rsquo;ve told at least me some personal stories
in which you were protected &ndash; there was reasons you were told
to leave a room at a certain opportune moment, and so on and so
forth. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right. And I have had that happen to
me over and over and over again. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Right. So that means
there&rsquo;s a force for good... <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Profoundly dangerous
things happening and at the moment I just did not know, walked out
and some terrible, dangerous thing happened, and I never even heard
about it. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So there seems to be a force for good, some
&ldquo;White Hats&rdquo; behind the scenes... <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yes. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
...some of whom have actually talked to you face to face, protected
you. One that passed on recently comes to mind. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Right.
<br><br>KC:&nbsp; These people who might have been working behind the
scenes, even in places that, you know, made them appear to be working
for the dark side, if you will. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah, the establishment.
But in point of fact, they were extremely powerful people and very
high placed. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Working for the light. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Working
for the light.

AND
THEY TOLD ME:&nbsp; <I>We know what you&rsquo;re doing.</I>

ONE
OF THEM TOLD ME:&nbsp; <I>You have some very powerful friends that you
don&rsquo;t even know exist, and they&rsquo;re protecting you.</I>
<br><br>I <I>know</I>. I have had the... I&rsquo;m not going to get
into the details, but I have actually witnessed protection from the
highest sources in this country step into something that was very,
very serious happening in relation to me, and I was really
frightened, because I knew the implications of what&rsquo;s happening
and they could be very serious for me. I &ldquo;may not be around
much longer,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve heard from the top. <br><br>And then
all of a sudden I get a communication from Washington, D.C., from the
highest office there, saying: <I>Don&rsquo;t worry about it, we took
care of it. Just go on and don&rsquo;t worry about it.</I> And I was
amazed &ndash; from Washington, D.C.! Somebody that high up calls me
and says: <I>Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Just go on about your life.
No one&rsquo;s going to bother you.</I> And they didn&rsquo;t. <br><br>I&rsquo;ve
had this happen many, many times when something very serious... very
serious threats against my life and against my work. I get a phone
call or someone will walk up to me in a public place and say: <I>Jordan,
that thing that you&rsquo;ve been worried about the last two weeks?</I>
<br><br><I>Yeah. </I><br><br><I>We took care of it. Move on. Don&rsquo;t
worry about it. </I><br><br>I thought: <I>Well...</I> I mean, I&rsquo;m
still here, I&rsquo;m still alive, [Kerry laughs] so I know that I
have been protected. I know that. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Absolutely. <br><br>DW:&nbsp;
 Where would the truth movement be without you? Specifically,
<I>Zeitgeist</I> is a movie that was in the top five most-viewed on
Google Video for like a year at least and I would like the Project
Camelot viewers to be apprised of the situation in regards to your
involvement with <I>Zeitgeist</I> because it seems like Management,
as I call them, put you in a position in which the whole conspiracy
theory movement wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere near what it is now if it
wasn&rsquo;t for your influence. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yes, <I>Zeitgeist</I>
is a two-hour movie made by a guy named Peter Joseph in New York. I
didn&rsquo;t know anything about it, but Peter Joseph produced a
two-hour video and the last that we heard... because on <I>Zeitgeist
</I>it was one of the first times Google pulled the counter off of
something that&rsquo;s on Google Video? Usually it would have a
counter, how many people have seen this video. They pulled the
counter. They pulled it, I think it was at 28 million when they
pulled it and that was like a year-and-a-half ago. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And
that&rsquo;s based all on your work, isn&rsquo;t it? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; All
of it was based on my work. Jeff Rense had Peter Joseph... and you
can go to my website, <U><A HREF="https://www.Jordanmaxwell.com/" TARGET="_blank">www.Jordanmaxwell.com</A></U>
, and go to the audio/video page. One of the first entries is a big
banner saying <I>Zeitgeist</I> <I>Interview,</I> and it&rsquo;s only
about five minutes long. <br><br>But Jeff Rense interviewed Peter
Joseph about <I>Zeitgeist</I> and talked about how, you know, they
pulled the counter a year-and-a-half ago at 28 million and it&rsquo;s
probably more than 50 million now. <br><br>BUT HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Why did
you make this video?</I> <br><br>AND HE [Peter Joseph] SAID:&nbsp; <I>Because
the whole thing was Jordan Maxwell&rsquo;s work. I was listening to
him; I&rsquo;ve been following his work and I just decided since he
hasn&rsquo;t done anything, I will.</I> <br><br>So he put all of my
work together on religion, ancient theology, the Federal Reserve,
banking, and 9/11 and all that nonsense, and put it all together into
a two-hour video called <I>Zeitgeist,</I> which I am told by
people... <br><br>My friends in Hollywood (and I&rsquo;ve lived in
Hollywood for 48 years) my friends have said that if they had 28
million and they pulled it off a year ago; probably seen by 50
million &ndash; that&rsquo;s a very good showing in Hollywood! If<I>
y</I>ou can get 50 million people watching something that represents
you, that&rsquo;s pretty heady stuff in Hollywood. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Absolutely. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t do it. I didn&rsquo;t even
know anything about it. But since then, there have been about six
other professionally-presented videos done on me that I had no idea.
People would call and tell me: <I>There&rsquo;s an hour show on you
in England; there&rsquo;s an hour show on you in France.</I>
<br><br>Germany actually came over -- the National German Network --
came over, and did an hour program on me, and they had Arnold
Schwarzenegger in it, and the whole thing was in German. [Kerry
laughs] I still have a copy of it they sent me. It was done in German
on me. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I understand. Now, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re
willing to talk about this, but Zecharia Sitchin and you sat down and
you asked him to tell you a secret. Based on all your time with him,
the things that you had done for him, etcetera, etcetera, you
basically said: <I>Tell me something that I don&rsquo;t know.</I>
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Are you willing to talk about that?
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; No. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Because I think that that is a clue
that people would really benefit from knowing. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. I
don&rsquo;t think I want to talk about that. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 Because... <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Do you feel that Zecharia would not like
that information out there? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; No. It was that it was a
private conversation and when I asked him... Because, like I said, at
one time I was in business with Zecharia. I had a contract with him,
and so we were business partners, and so I felt a little bit more of
a leeway to talk with Zecharia in private. So I asked him one time
some very personal questions about his work and it was absolutely
mind-blowing and staggering, the things he was telling me. <br><br>And
then... Well anyway, then he told me some things about <I>myself</I>
and I was amazed. I never heard such a thing, that what he was being
told, or wherever he got it from, he had a view on <I>me</I>, who I
am and what I&rsquo;m doing. But at that time we were talking, it was
a private conversation, and I think it&rsquo;d be better just left
private. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. Fine. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; All I will say is
this: Zecharia Sitchin is a fascinating man and a brilliant writer,
and I love everything he&rsquo;s doing, and I love the man. He&rsquo;s
a very dear friend and I love Zecharia Sitchin. He&rsquo;s a very,
very gentleman kind of guy, and so... I like that. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay.
Would you classify what you&rsquo;ve been talking about, in a sense,
as a &ldquo;<I>war</I>&rdquo; that is going on, on a spiritual level?
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yes. No doubt about it. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; For the hearts and
minds of humanity? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yes. Absolutely. There is a spiritual
war going on right now and Hollywood&rsquo;s making movies about it &ndash;
<I>War of the Worlds</I>, Steven Spielberg. I&rsquo;ve said so many
times that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are many things, but
stupid is not one of them. [laughs] <br><br>Steven Spielberg is
trying to tell you something. In one of his interviews a few years
back, I remember he said that he does not... Steven Spielberg said: <I>I
don&rsquo;t make movies to entertain, necessarily; I make movies to
comment on important issues of the day. </I><br><br>And looking at
Spielberg&rsquo;s work, which is genius... something I want to say
about Spielberg: I&rsquo;ve watched a lot of productions and I&rsquo;ve
been in Hollywood for a long time, 48 years I&rsquo;ve lived in North
Hollywood and Hollywood, and I have many, many, many friends in the
industry. I already know, because I&rsquo;ve been told, that
virtually all the major names in Hollywood know who I am &ndash; and
they should &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been talking for 48 years! [laughs]
And they&rsquo;re using all my stuff now, so they should know me.
<br><br>But Steven Spielberg is one of the most clever people I have
ever watched a person&rsquo;s work, because he puts... a couple of
things. One is: he&rsquo;s a stickler for accuracy on costumes and
terms that are used, so anytime you see anything that Spielberg has
made, it&rsquo;s very accurate &ndash; the clothing that would have
been worn in those days, the way the people would have talked, it&rsquo;s
very accurately done. So he&rsquo;s a stickler for accuracy. <br><br>But
the thing I really appreciate about Steven Spielberg is he puts
little things, little small things that you would never see if you&rsquo;re
not looking for it, that are really a mind-blower, a <I>Wow</I>. Back
that up, and that one scene with that one person, what they said...
he&rsquo;s a master at doing that. He&rsquo;s a master at putting
powerful things in some little insignificant scene, so if you&rsquo;re
not watching, you&rsquo;ll never get to see the real genius of Steven
Spielberg. I love watching his movies because I know what I&rsquo;m
looking for. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So he&rsquo;s using symbolism. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Oh yeah! <br><br>KC:&nbsp; All over his movies. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Everywhere!
And George Lucas, equal. George Lucas is brilliant, in my opinion. He
said he was heavily influenced by Joseph Campbell, the famous...
<br><br>KC:&nbsp; Yes. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And Joseph Campbell was an incredibly
dear man. I just loved listening to Joseph Campbell explain
mythologies and all the symbols of the ancient people. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Did you know him? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; No, I never had a chance to meet
Joseph Campbell. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; What about Arthur C. Clarke? Did you
meet him? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; No, I never had a chance to meet Arthur C.
Clarke either, but I would love to have. I&rsquo;ve had opportunities
to be in the company of people like that, but I was not in a position
to travel, I didn&rsquo;t have the money, I was in a depressed state
of mind, and so I let some very important people go by that I could
have been with. <br><br>I used to be on the board of directors of an
organization in Hollywood &ndash; this was quite a few years ago &ndash;
called USofA. USofA was <I>United Sensitives of America</I>. This
organization was founded in Burbank and I came in at a very early
period and I ended up being on the board of directors of USofA. I
really didn&rsquo;t take a whole lot of charge in it. The man who
started it pretty much ran it, but in words, I was on the board of
directors. <br><br>But anyway, it was an organization where
numerologists, astrologers, all kinds of esoteric disciplines would
come together and we would put on shows, expos, and also once a year
we would put on an award show where we would honor certain movie
stars for their work feeding the poor or whatever. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; But
weren&rsquo;t you also involved in maybe discovering murder suspects?
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And also occult happenings that
were going on. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Every two weeks, I think it was like
every two weeks, we would meet about 9:00 in the evening up in the
Hollywood Hills from the Hollywood sign. We would be up there, and
there&rsquo;d be about 50 people up there in this big, huge home that
was owned by a movie star who had passed away. It was a huge, big
home and the front room was just enormous in size and there would be
like 50 people there every two weeks. There would be a group of
astrologers, a group of psychics, a group of numerologists, this
group and that group, and they were all different disciplines in the
esoteric sciences. <br><br>And we would have the Police Department or
the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department &ndash; usually it was LAPD would come
up, sheriff a couple of times too &ndash; and they would come up. We
had a big blackboard and they would have pictures up on the wall of
the case that they wanted us to talk about. They would show us the
person who was kidnapped, or the body that was found, or whatever the
case was, and then the officer in charge, usually a detective, would
write down or have it already written down, all the pertinent
information that the Police Department had and each group sat with a
group. All the astrologers sat together... <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I do want to
ask you which group were you among? Were you psychic? <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
No. I was with the people who were putting it on. It was all being
sponsored by the USofA, United Sensitives of America, and since I was
on the board, I was there representing the company that&rsquo;s
putting this thing together. <br><br>Like I said, we also would have
award ceremonies once a year in which we would give awards to
different people who were doing different things for humanity. I was
privileged to be able to be there to give Manly Palmer Hall an award
for his work in service to the world. <br><br>Manly Palmer Hall, I
believe, was one of the finest and most dearest men I have ever met
in my life. He was not only charming, an extraordinarily brilliant
mind, but he was one of the most decent and beautiful people that I
have ever, personally, have ever met. <br><br>Manly Palmer Hall was
an extraordinary teacher. He never promoted anything. He merely
educated people, as: <I>This is where this came from; this is where
that came from; this is what that word means.</I> So he was an
educator. People have called him all kinds of names because he was a
Mason. I knew him personally. I&rsquo;ve been to his home. When he
died, he left me a beautiful gift &ndash; all of his research
journals, he left to me. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s amazing. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 I was shocked when I got a phone call from the Philosophical
Research Society in Los Angeles and Obadiah Harris, the president at
that time, said: <I>Mr. Hall wanted you to have something when he
passed away</I>. <br><br>AND I SAID:&nbsp; <I>What is it?</I> I was in San
Diego. <br><br>AND HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you. Just
come pick it up.</I>

So
I drove up that day to Los Angeles from San Diego and it was all of
the research journals of Manly Palmer Hall, he gave to me. And I
consider that to be a monumental gift from a very powerful man. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 Did you find some clues there to follow out? [laughs] <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Tons of stuff there. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Manly Palmer
Hall, as I said, was one of the greatest teachers the world has ever
known. In my humble opinion, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s ever
been in any era of time a man to come close to what Manly Palmer Hall
was able to do. Anyone who has an open mind &ndash; and of course,
your mind is like a parachute: it doesn&rsquo;t work if it&rsquo;s
not open &ndash; anyone who is intellectually honest, which you don&rsquo;t
find very much -- intellectually honest with an open mind, mature and
intelligent person looking at the work of Manly Palmer Hall would
have to say this is one of the greatest men that ever lived. <br><br>I
don&rsquo;t know how many... maybe 70 or 80 books on esoteric
subjects of the whole world; over 46 sets of lectures, like six
90-minute audio lectures of 46 esoteric subjects of the world. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 Wonderful. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Incredible. Plus thousands of lectures.
Incidentally, I have everything he ever did. Every lecture he ever
did I have, digitized. Monumental work. But he was a personal friend
of mine and I loved him dearly. I&rsquo;m saying this because there
are so many people who put him down because he was a Mason. He was a
wonderful teacher, a brilliant man, to which his detractors could not
even hold a candle. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I hear you. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s
not the only one. I have other people I feel the same way about.
<br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. How do you feel, just to change gears here a
little bit, about the current administration of Obama? <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
[sighs] Well, I&rsquo;m not political as such. Personally &ndash; I
think I ought to choose my words carefully here &ndash; because I
like Obama as a person, and he&rsquo;s very personable; he&rsquo;s
the kind of guy I would love to sit and chat with. His children are
beautiful, his wife is a very intelligent lady. And so I don&rsquo;t
have anything against Obama or his family. I think they&rsquo;re very
personable and very interesting people. <br><br>But it&rsquo;s the
powers behind him, that he represents, that&rsquo;s frightening to
me. I know things about the people who are behind him that is
absolutely staggering, frightening. I live in fear of what&rsquo;s
coming, because of <I>what I know</I> &ndash; not because of what I
believe or think &ndash; <I>because of what I know</I>. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Are you talking about war? Are you talking about an agenda that
involves war? World War Three? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s always
possible. Let me go back and say this. Again, I have nothing against
Obama as a person and I like him. The family, nothing against them at
all. But the symbol that I was telling you about, that I&rsquo;ve
been working on... Did you ever see the movie or the television show
<I>V?</I> <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Oh, absolutely. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; The very first
one? <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Yes. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well, ABC is now remaking <I>V.</I>
They&rsquo;re remaking it. And I was shocked &ndash; someone sent me
an email. I think they were in Hollywood, and they sent me an email
with a picture from the new movie coming out soon. I think it&rsquo;s
going to come out in the next month or so, a made-for-television
movie by ABC. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Oh, really? Okay. Fabulous. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Disney / ABC. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Very interesting. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Okay? <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 Okay. Yeah? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s going to be called <I>V</I>
and it&rsquo;s a remake of the original. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
 But in it, the extraterrestrials who are referred to as <I>the
Visitors</I>? The Visitors in the new one are giving to the public a
pamphlet explaining their (quote) &ldquo;New World Order&rdquo; that
they are bringing to planet? <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Right. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And the
picture, which I have, shocked me. My knees got weak and I had to sit
down. It was shocking. It was the Visitors, the alien visitors who
looked like humans, were handing out pamphlets to the people about
their New Order that <I>they</I> were going to bring in and the title
of the pamphlet was: <I>The Dawn of a New Day -- </I>the very words
that I have been researching for some 40 years is now going to be in
the movie, the new <I>V</I>. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m
telling you, that is not only significant, it&rsquo;s mind-blowing
when I give you the whole story. [Kerry laughs] ABC and Disney are
telling you something about this symbol that I&rsquo;ve been looking
at for a long time and it&rsquo;s going to be right in your face.
Because I&rsquo;m telling you, that symbol is going to become the
most important symbol around the globe, for the first time in the
public view. <br><br>Anytime you want to do research on the hidden
stuff like I&rsquo;ve done, it&rsquo;s everywhere. But no, now
because of Obama, now the secret societies of the &ndash; what I
think are extraterrestrial masters of this world &ndash; are going to
bring this symbol out into the world, so everyone can see it. <br><br>And
eventually what&rsquo;s going to happen is that the whole human race
is going to wake up. And this is my opinion about 2012 &ndash; my
opinion of 2012 is there&rsquo;s going to be an awakening for the
whole world: <I>We&rsquo;ve been had! </I>They&rsquo;re going to see
this is an ancient thing that&rsquo;s been coming for a long time and
we never saw it, we didn&rsquo;t understand it. <br><br>But when my
video comes out that I want to do &ndash; it&rsquo;s going to be like
a three-hour step-by-step on Obama&rsquo;s symbol, Jimmy Carter, all
the Presidents, the Bushes, the entire superstructure of Western
Civilization, and what this stuff <I>really</I> means, and where it
is <I>really</I> comes from. <br><br>I think, and I&rsquo;m not
trying to aggrandize myself, but I really believe that it&rsquo;s
going to cause quite a sensation when people see what I really am,
that I&rsquo;ve never told anyone before. <br><br>And when I see
Obama using the same terms, the same symbol, the same one that the
Communists used, the Nazis have used, the fascists have used, the
secret societies around the world of Freemasonry have used; the
Babylonians; as I said, all the ancient Egyptians &ndash; they all
used the same word, term, and symbol. <br><br>And now ABC is coming
out, Disney / ABC is coming out with a new remake of <I>V</I> and in
it, the extraterrestrials that look like humans, who are bringing a
(quote) &ldquo;New Order&rdquo; to the world, and the pamphlet in the
movie is called <I>Dawn of a New Day!</I> <br><br>I SAID:&nbsp; <I>WOW!</I>
I
cannot believe how overwhelmingly obvious this secret symbol is now
becoming, and that&rsquo;s why I will do this video on it. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 But were you told more about the movie? More about where they&rsquo;re
going with it, in other words? I&rsquo;m assuming you haven&rsquo;t
seen it yet. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; No, I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, but I
watched the other one so many times. And the &ldquo;other ones&rdquo;,
if you remember the original, the Visitors, they were wonderful
people. They were very gracious and charming. And then remember the
lady who was in charge of the visitors, she was the highest ranking,
she went into a room and pulled off her face &ndash; it was a reptile
alien? <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Yes. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I personally, I brought
David Icke to America. He was in America because I brought him here,
personally. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Yes. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And so I&rsquo;m saying
that I am totally convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt, for myself,
that there are such things as reptile aliens, though I have never
seen one, thank God. But I totally believe they are here. Not because
of David Icke, not because of Credo Mutwa, who I love listening to, a
wonderful, fascinating man. David Icke has done great stuff. But I
believe there are reptile aliens here, because of my own personal
research. <br><br>I have been in the company of at least eight people
over the past many years, eight different people... each one is
extraordinarily well-grounded, people. Airline pilot, one, with a
major airline. <br><br>A very wealthy man in Las Vegas who buys and
sells commercial hotels and buildings, etcetera &ndash; extremely
wealthy man &ndash; Christian, incidentally, very Christian man, but
very, very wealthy and very highly intelligent man sat down and told
me about his personal one-on-one with a reptile alien in which many
others in his church were privy to see. That&rsquo;s a whole story in
itself that happened in Colorado. And then to have scientists...
<br><br>And a young lady who was one of my favorite people in the
world, a young lady called Nancy, who just blew me away. On my radio
show &ndash; I used to have a show; I&rsquo;ve had seven different
radio shows in my life. I&rsquo;d like to get back on radio and do my
own show again. But I had a show on KPFK here in Los Angeles, FM
station, and one night I had Nancy on and Nancy just blew the
audience away. She is so feminine, so incredibly charming and
feminine girl, talking about stuff that will blow your mind. KC:&nbsp;
[laughs] <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Her father was in the Air Force. Her family was
Air Force, but her father was in charge of Project Retrievables for
the Air Force &ndash; the man who was in charge of going out wherever
in the world [there was] any extraterrestrial activity. He was in
charge in the Air Force to go there first, and he was the boss, and
she said the <I>modus operandi</I> was always the same. I&rsquo;ll
have to make you a copy of her two... I&rsquo;ve got two two-hour
interviews that will just knock you out. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I&rsquo;d love
to hear. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; You could tell this is a very charming girl,
but telling you stuff that you&rsquo;re going to have to sit down to
deal with. [laughs] <br><br>She said wherever they would go; she
always lived on military bases. And she said always the method was
the same... there was one phone in the house for the family, and then
there was another phone, which no one ever touched; you never used
it. <br><br>When that phone would ring, no matter when -- two in the
morning, three in the morning -- it doesn&rsquo;t matter; if that
phone rang, her father had ten minutes to be fully dressed with his
briefcase, and ready to go. In ten minutes a car would pull up and
nothing was said -- no voices, nothing was said. A knock on the door,
he would walk out; he would have military escort into the car, get in
the car, and drive off, and nothing said. Nobody knows where he&rsquo;s
gone, and nobody needs to know. <br><br>And so she said that many a
night, they would get that phone ring, he would get up, dress,
briefcase ready to go, and they would take him somewhere in the world
where something has just happened and the Air Force was sending him
to see what just happened and they&rsquo;re in charge. <br><br>And
she would tell me the things that her father, and especially her
mother... She said the father would never tell her anything when she
was a child, but the mother would tell her later on in life. <br><br>She
told me an experience that just blew my mind about a reptile alien.
You really have to hear it from her, but basically the story is so
fascinating [that] I&lsquo;ve got to tell you it. <br><br>SHE SAID:&nbsp;
<I>Her father would never allow her to be left alone in the house,
ever. When he would go off during the day... they live on base... it
doesn&rsquo;t matter. When he would leave the house, immediately
military would come and guard all four corners of the property. They
would sit there in cars and guard while he&rsquo;s gone anywhere. If
he went to the market or whatever, they would be guarding the house,
and he would never allow her to stay at home by herself. </I><br><br>And
so she said one night &ndash; you&rsquo;ll hear this interview &ndash;
she said one night... it wasn&rsquo;t on base, they were here in Los
Angeles somewhere... <br><br>And she said that her mom and dad were
going next door to a party next door, and she asked her dad if she
could stay. She was like thirteen, fourteen years old. <br><br>AND HE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>No. Absolutely not.</I> <br><br>So she talked to her mother
and the mother talked to the father and got him to agree that she
could stay home. <br><br>AND SHE SAID:&nbsp; <I>So for the first time in
her life, she was actually going to be alone in the house by herself.
</I><br><br>SO SHE SAID:&nbsp; <I>She was in a bedroom combing her hair
and she had a mirror that she could see her closet and the closet had
French doors.</I> <br><br>SHE SAID:&nbsp; <I>They were closed, partially
closed, and it wasn&rsquo;t too well lit in the room.</I> <br><br>SHE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>She was combing her hair, looking at the closet door, and
all of a sudden, the closet door opened up and a reptile alien
stepped out.</I> <br><br>SHE SAID:&nbsp; He <I>had to bend down to get
under the header and he stood up</I>. <br><br>SHE SAID:&nbsp; <I>It was a
full-grown man, extremely muscular, but it was a reptile body,
reptile alien head. </I><br><br>AND SHE SAID:&nbsp; <I>This thing looked
at me and I&rsquo;m looking at it in the mirror.</I> <br><br>AND SHE
SAID:&nbsp; <I>He started moving toward me without moving his legs</I> &ndash;
he was just floating toward her, slowly. <br><br>AND SHE SAID:&nbsp; <I>I
felt like it was like coming up on a fly, you know, grab it quick.</I>
<br><br>SHE SAYS:&nbsp; <I>She jumped up and screamed and ran down the
hallway, ran into the bathroom, locked the door, opened the window
and started screaming.</I> <br><br>Of course, everybody in the
neighborhood heard. <br><br>AND SHE SAID:&nbsp; <I>This reptile alien came
down the hallway.</I> <br><br>AND SHE SAID:&nbsp; <I>I could feel him
walking, because he was so heavy and he was scraping on the door,
growling like a dinosaur growl, scraping on the door.</I> She said:
<I>that when her father and the neighbors come running up, they
opened the door. When they came running up, they were yelling
outside, this reptile alien ran back down the hallway into her
bedroom and disappeared. </I><br><br>SHE SAID:&nbsp; <I>When her father
came in, the bathroom door was just ripped, and obviously, the father
said he was not going to hurt her, but it was a message. </I><br><br>AND
HE SAID:&nbsp; <I>That&rsquo;s why I never wanted her to stay alone,
because these aliens have told us, the Air Force, that &ldquo;You
keep poking your nose into our business. Every time something happens
you come out and poke your nose. So we just want you to know, the
next time something happens and you poke your nose into our business,
while you&rsquo;re out here poking your nose in our business, some of
us are going to come visit your daughter, so you need to stay home
and stay out of our business.&rdquo; </I><br><br>So he said that&rsquo;s
why they always had military around any time he left. <br><br>And so
when she was telling me this story about other reptile aliens... and
of course, I&rsquo;ve heard it from so many legitimately-important
people, I have to believe that there is something to this story. I
have personally not seen one, but I don&rsquo;t want to. [Kerry
laughs] <br><br>But I&rsquo;ve seen enough to know that there are
life forms on this Earth, which are not from here. I&rsquo;ve already
seen too much to know that. My experiences have been extraordinary.
As I said, 36 major experiences I&rsquo;ve had in my life, where I&rsquo;ve
dealt with other-world phenomena. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. Well, this is a
really amazing interview. Can you talk at all about anything else
that you think that people should know in terms of the overall
picture that you&rsquo;ve been giving them here? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I WOULD
SAY:&nbsp; <I>Be aware that there is a war for your soul.</I>

There
is a war for the spiritual. You know, there&rsquo;s always been this
question for thousand of years, all the great philosophers ask it,
about whether we are physical bodies which have a spirit in it, or
are we originally a spirit which has taken on a physical body? You
know, which comes first, the chicken or the egg? <br><br>But, I am
convinced that no matter how it happens -- if we were physical and
took on a spirit, or maybe we were spirit and took on a physical
body, I believe that there is a war going on from somebody out there
that was an original enemy of whoever created us. So whoever created
us has enemies out there in the universe and that are diabolical
enemies. <br><br>And we know this is true in government, you know.
You may see the President and the First Lady and all of that. It&rsquo;s
very prominent and proper, but they have enemies, powerful enemies.
That&rsquo;s why they have to be totally surrounded by military and
protection because they have serious enemies. Something happened to
me that tells me that there&rsquo;s something going on like that. I
was in Hawaii many years ago. My wife and some friends, we went to
Hawaii for the first time. I was sitting in a restaurant across the
street from the Hilton Village. <br><br>In the restaurant &ndash;
which is a main drag, a main strip &ndash; I was sitting with my back
to the door. Someone came in and I immediately had an electrical
charge go through my body. It&rsquo;s bad enough being shocked by a
wall plug, but if you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s coming, it&rsquo;s
even worse. <br><br>I was sitting at the table talking, and all of a
sudden, somebody came in and an electrical shock went through me and
I knocked stuff on the table, I knocked water and stuff on the table
and I jumped up, involuntarily. <br><br>I JUST JUMPED UP AND
SOMETHINIG TOLD ME:&nbsp; <I>Run quick, you&rsquo;re in trouble! You&rsquo;re
going to die</I>. <I>Run quick!</I> <br><br>I ran out the back door
of the restaurant... ran across the restaurant -- left my wife and my
friends -- ran across the restaurant, ran out the back door. <br><br>AND
THE VOICE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Run quick, you&rsquo;re in trouble! Go across the
street to the hotel.</I> <br><br>AND I SCREAMED, I REMEMBER YELLING:&nbsp;
<I>I can&rsquo;t go across the street, there&rsquo;s traffic out
there.</I> <br><br>AND IT SAID:&nbsp; <I>Run! There will be no traffic.
Run!</I> <br><br>And so I ran out into the street, involuntarily. I
was not making a conscious decision to do any of this, it was being
foisted on me. I ran across the street and as it so happened, there
was no traffic for that little stretch. <br><br>I RAN OUT AND IT
SAID:&nbsp; <I>Go out around the hotel</I>. <br><br>THE VOICE WAS SAYING:&nbsp;
<I>Run quick to the hotel.</I> <br><br>AND I RAN AROUND THE HOTEL AND
IT SAID:&nbsp; <I>All right, you&rsquo;re safe now. Now you&rsquo;re safe.</I>
<br><br>AND I SAT DOWN, MY HEART WAS POUNDING AND I KEPT THINKING:&nbsp;
<I>What did I just do? And how am I going to explain this to my wife
and my friends, what I just did involuntarily? I don&rsquo;t know
what happened.</I> <br><br>That happened to me twice. <br><br>The
second time was a few months later in Los Angeles. I was on the
corner of Fairfax and Wilshire Boulevard in a little coffee shop
called Johnnie&rsquo;s Hamburger Stand. It&rsquo;s a little
restaurant. I was sitting at the counter and I noticed &ndash;
peripheral vision, I didn&rsquo;t look over to see them, but
peripheral vision -- I saw two guys walk in, and as they walked in,
immediately an electrical shock hit me. I almost fell off... I was at
the counter. <br><br>AND THE VOICE SAID:&nbsp; <I>Get out quick! You&rsquo;re
in trouble. Run!</I> <br><br>And I so I grabbed a bunch of money,
threw it on the counter and tripped trying to get out of the chair on
the counter. I got up and I hit the side door and I ran north on
Fairfax. <br><br>AND THE VOICE KEPT SAYING:&nbsp; <I>Run! Your life is in
danger. Run quick!</I> <br><br>I RAN ABOUT TWO OR THREE BLOCKS UNTIL
I WAS JUST ABOUT OUT OF BREATH AND THEN THE VOICE SAID:&nbsp; <I>All
right. You&rsquo;re safe now. You&rsquo;re safe now. Sit down.</I>
<br><br>And I sat down; my heart was pounding again. And it was
involuntary... I didn&rsquo;t make a conscious choice to run, I just
started running and the voice was talking. It was yelling to me. It
was actually like a yell: <I>MOVE QUICK! YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER!</I>
<br><br>So that happened twice to me. I have no idea what that all
means. I&rsquo;m just telling you what happened. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay.
So you are positing the fact that there is this symbol that in the
symbol is basically telling the world of a New World Order and the
return, or basically, a Son [and/or Sun] taking control, and that
this is happening sometime in the near future. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah.
<br><br>KC:&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m assuming you think around 2012. Is that
correct? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. That&rsquo;s what I think. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Okay. And then you&rsquo;re talking also about, really, reptilians
and an agenda which is not quite clear but there is something going
on with that. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; So what
I&rsquo;m now asking you is whether or not that so-called king is
reptilian. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t know and what I would say
to an audience that&rsquo;s watching this... I&rsquo;ve said it too
many times before, but I think it bears saying again: I&rsquo;m not
the world&rsquo;s foremost authority on anything. I&rsquo;m just
telling you what I have seen with my own eyes, what has happened to
me in my life. <br><br>But I would also say to anyone who would scoff
at this, just look at what I have to offer first before you make a
decision if I&rsquo;m crazy or not. See what I have amassed in the
past 40 years that I haven&rsquo;t told you, that you don&rsquo;t
know that I have, and see the research that I have done on this
subject of this New Order of the world which I started talking about
back in 1960. <br><br>I was sending letters to Belmont, Massachusetts
back in 1960, Belmont Massachusetts. I was sending letters to the
John Birch Society who had just been formed in 1959. The John Birch
Society was, of course, exposing all the Communist activity in the
world, especially in America. <br><br>I was already well into all of
that in &rsquo;59 when they started, and so I started sending them
articles, things like: <I>Well, you need to look at this symbol and
this word and this term here and also you might want to look at this
guy and this organization. </I>So I was sending them little tidbits
of information back in 1960 on the subject of Illuminati... on secret
societies, not Illuminati. <br><br>Because the Illuminati, I found
out about, like I said, in 1967 when Anthony Hilder produced the
series of records, of three 33-1/3 record albums called <I>Illuminati</I>.
. [<I>&ldquo;The Illuminati and the Council on Foreign Relations&rdquo;</I>]
The man speaking was an incredibly interesting man named Myron Fagan
and I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever heard Myron Fagan, <I>The
Illuminati</I> record. It will knock you out, absolutely. Today, it&rsquo;s
still a knockout when I hear it today <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Wow. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
I heard it 40 years ago. When I hear it today, it&rsquo;s still a
mind-blower. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I have a question for you that is a little
bit moving on to another topic. It has to do with the illuminati, but
I wonder if you would address it. What is the significance of merging
the red and the black? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.
It&rsquo;s called &ndash; red and black and white, all three: red,
black, and white &ndash; are referred to in Hollywood as <I>Death&rsquo;s
Head </I>colors, because <I>Death&rsquo;s Head</I> comes from a Nazi
organization called the SS, the Gestapo. Gestapo was referred to as
the <I>Order of the Death&rsquo;s Head</I>, and the <I>Order of the
Death&rsquo;s Head</I>, Gestapo of Nazi Germany symbol was the skull
and crossbones &ndash; <I>Skull and Bones.</I> That was their symbol.
<br><br>But to the Germans on the inside, the Gestapo was called the
<I>Order of Death&rsquo;s Head</I> and <I>Death&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;s
</I>colors in Hollywood... <br><br>I attended a lecture many years
ago by a black doctor who worked at Martin Luther King Hospital and
some of my friends in the motion picture industry, black
entertainers, called me and said: <I>You really need to be here
tonight. You need to come and hear this. It&rsquo;s going to be a
private lecture by a doctor from Chicago who came out here.</I> It
was an actual doctor working at Martin Luther King Hospital and he
was giving a lecture on <I>Death&rsquo;s Head</I> colors. <br><br>It
was fascinating. It was a slide presentation at a library, in Santa
Monica library, in a private invitation only. There was only about 25
to 30 people there. And he was explaining the <I>Death&rsquo;s Head</I>
colors, why it&rsquo;s black, white, and red, and how black, white,
and red are used in motion pictures. When someone is going to die or
someone&rsquo;s going to be killed, those are the three prominent
colors that will always be in those scenes. They&rsquo;re called
<I>Death&rsquo;s Head</I> colors. They symbolize the darkness of the
darkest, the most profound presence of evil &ndash; red, white, and
black. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s also a significance in terms of
the occult, with regard to certain genetics. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Certain
genetics? Oh, of course. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; In other words, the red being a
red-headed person with certain kinds of DNA. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m
sure there&rsquo;s more to that. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And the black being a
blond, usually Celtic, a mixture perhaps. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
that there is that, too. Yeah. The only thing I was saying was that
was very interesting because I remember that night he talked about
the European Masonic Orders and how the Mexican gangs in Los Angeles
and around the country use Masonic symbols from a particular Masonic
Order in Europe, while the black gangs use opposing symbols and terms
of a different Masonic Order in Europe, and that most likely the gang
members themselves do not realize that these actually can be traced
back to Masonic symbols in Europe. <br><br>So I believe that the
gangs going on in America today are being organized, directed, and
financed out of Europe to destroy our culture in America. I think
that European Freemasonry is heavily involved in destroying America,
and you need to understand the whole story about how America was
founded, and how it was founded as a corporation. It&rsquo;s a
privately-owned corporation. We can talk about that for days on end.
<br><br>This is just my opinion, one man&rsquo;s opinion, but I&rsquo;m
going to give you my opinion as to the bottom line on the world today
and the stuff that&rsquo;s going on, on the Earth today. <br><br>What
we call <I>Illuminati</I> was originally a term which was given to,
in Spain, to a religious order in Spain that later on were
amalgamated into what we call <I>Jesuits</I>, so the Jesuits are
truly Illuminati themselves. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And the Vatican. And you go
into that as well. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; That was what I was going to say.
Yes. I believe that one of the most evil organizations that exists on
the Earth today &ndash; and you&rsquo;d have to have spent all the
years with me in libraries and research societies and travel and go
around the world and talking to other writers, authors, lecturers,
and teachers, and collecting this stuff over a period of 45 to 48
years &ndash; to understand what I&rsquo;m telling you. But I believe
today the most serious, evil organization on the face of the Earth is
the Vatican. That&rsquo;s my personal opinion. <br><br>I think if the
Vatican was done away with off the face of the Earth, there would be
a shot of liberation heard round the world, because the Vatican, in
my opinion, is the bulwark of this dark thing that&rsquo;s happening
on the Earth. <br><br>So when you talk about Illuminati, when you
talk about the really dark criminal stuff that&rsquo;s going on on
the Earth, you&rsquo;re talking the Vatican. <br><br>You&rsquo;re
talking the Knights of Malta, which gave us... the six men who
founded the CIA in America were all Catholics, members of the Knights
of Malta. <br><br>When you begin to look at the banking fraternities
in America, like the Bank of America, Union Bank in California, all
of these people who founded these banks and today are running the
banking establishment are all Knights of Malta &ndash; Catholic
Masonry. <br><br>So when I hear people talking about the Jews this,
the Jews that, and the Jews are responsible, I say: <I>No, no. You
better go back and do your homework.</I> The Jews have been
slaughtered all over Europe by the Vatican. <br><br>You need to
remember that for at least 2,300 years, Rome has dominated Europe,
under the Caesars of Rome. Then in the late 4th century the Vatican
comes into being and the Vatican dominates all of Europe. <br><br>All
the heads of state, all the princes and kings and rulers... all the
kings and rulers in Europe ruled by the <I>Divine Right</I>. It&rsquo;s
called the <I>Divine Right of Kings.</I> <br><br>What are you talking
about? Who represents <I>Divine</I> to give the king the <I>right</I>?
&ndash; the Pope. The Pope appoints certain families to be over the
French, the Pope appoints certain people to be over the Germans, and
over the British &ndash; and by <I>Divine right.</I> Why? Because the
Pope represents God, and the Pope says that this family is holy and
that they should rule, and therefore they&rsquo;ll say they rule by
<I>Divine Right</I>. <br><br>The whole idea of <I>Divine</I> goes
back to the chalice, you know, the Holy Grail. And in the Catholic
Mass, you have the priest breaking the bread and then pouring the
wine. Well, wine is made from grapes and wine is red, so it&rsquo;s a
red grape wine. It represents the blood of the Atonement. Blood...
it&rsquo;s a blood sacrifice. <br><br>Where does the wine come from?
It comes from grapes, and grapes grow on <I>the vine</I>... and
that&rsquo;s where we get the concept and the word <I>Divine</I>
because grapes come from the vine. So that&rsquo;s where we get the
word <I>Divine</I>. <br><br>And once you begin to realize how the
Vatican has... for over 2,300 years, Rome has dominated Europe, and
in 1,600 years, the Vatican has dominated Europe &ndash; and Europe,
for 2,300 years, has dominated the Earth. <br><br>So if you want to
talk about conspiracies and you want to talk about evil, don&rsquo;t
talk about Jews. You better talk about the people who control Europe
for over 2,300 years &ndash; Caesar of Rome, the Roman Catholic
establishment. There&rsquo;s the real story. <br><br>Now you&rsquo;re
getting into Mafiosi. Now you&rsquo;re getting into the fraternal
orders of Freemasonry out of Europe, <I>Knights of Malta</I>. Now
you&rsquo;re getting into the organized crimes &ndash; Sicily,
Corsica &ndash; and all of the profound drug-running, white slavery,
murder for hire, Vatican. <br><br>I mean, even... what was his name,
the producer of <I>Godfather</I>? What was his name? Francis Ford
Coppola. In <I>Godfather III</I>, Francis Ford Coppola, in <I>Godfather
III</I>, the third one in the series, opens up with Michael Corleone
being anointed by the Cardinal in New York to be a member of the
<I>Knights of Malta</I> in the Catholic Church in New York. <br><br>What
is he telling you? The connection between the Vatican, the Holy
Father &ndash; there&rsquo;s nothing <I>holy</I> about the &ldquo;Holy
Father&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s nothing holy in Israel. Nothing. There&rsquo;s
nothing holy in the Vatican. There is nothing holy in Salt Lake City.
There&rsquo;s nothing holy in religion, period. <br><br>It&rsquo;s a
way that the masters, whoever these entities are who are controlling
the human race, they have set up certain institutions of learning, of
education, religion, and government. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve said
you better go back and do your homework on where the history of the
world comes from. <br><br>I don&rsquo;t see the world being run by
Jews. I see Jews being <I>used,</I> but you will find that even
Rothschild, the Rothschild family who we hear so much about: <I>Those
Jews who were running Europe</I>. No. If you go back and look at the
history of the Rothschilds, you will find that Rothschilds
represented the Vatican. <br><br>He was dealing for the Vatican. He
was a Vatican banker appointed by the Vatican to deal for them, so
that the Catholic Church would never be involved in all that terrible
stuff going on in banking: <I>We&rsquo;ll let the Jew do it.</I>
Then, of course, if something comes out, well, it was Jewish,
obviously. No, no. It&rsquo;s your money that he was handling. <br><br>So
if you really want to nail down the real enemy to America and then to
the Earth, I&rsquo;m telling you it&rsquo;s only taken me 48 years to
get here. I was born and raised Catholic. I mean, my whole family
were very Catholic. We were the most Catholic family in town. But I
know history and I know that the most criminal organization on the
face of the Earth, in my humble opinion &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know
that much about it, I&rsquo;ve just been looking here for 48 years &ndash;
is the Vatican. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I hear you. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; As far as I&rsquo;m
concerned, it&rsquo;s the worst thing that&rsquo;s ever happened to
the world is what&rsquo;s really going on in the Vatican. And that
doesn&rsquo;t even bring up the subject of <I>Propaganda Due</I>, P2
&ndash; <I>Propaganda Due, P2 Lodge</I>. That was even mentioned in
<I>Godfather III</I> twice. <br><br>There&rsquo;s a Masonic order in
Europe called <I>Propaganda Due</I>. It&rsquo;s called P2, and P2 is
connected directly through membership with <I>Opus Dei</I> and the
<I>Knights of Malta</I> and the Jesuits. <I>Jesuits/ Opus Dei/
Knights of Malta/ Masonic Order</I>, are connected directly to
something called <I>Propaganda Due, P2 Lodge of Freemasonry</I>. <br><br>P2
Lodge of Freemasonry is world famous to people who do research into
criminal organizations. P2 is pure, unadulterated, pouring directly
out of the trough of Nazism. Underworld organizations, drugs, human
trafficking, pornography, violence, underworld organizations &ndash;
it&rsquo;s all P2. They&rsquo;re the ones who are promoting the
right-wing death squads in Central and South America, Mexico, the
drug cartels in Colombia. <br><br>We&rsquo;re talking Catholic
Knights of Malta/ drug cartels/ Colombia &ndash; extraordinary vice
on a level which it is hard for most humans to recognize and it&rsquo;s
<I>all</I> being orchestrated out of the Holy Father in Rome. <br><br>This
is why I&rsquo;ve said so many times, there&rsquo;s never gonna be a
time in the history of this country that America will be saved. I
don&rsquo;t believe America can be saved. I truly do not believe that
America &ndash; or the human race &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think...
<br><br>It&rsquo;s just my opinion, again, but I don&rsquo;t think
the human race can be saved and I don&rsquo;t think America can be
saved, because so many millions of people just love the filth and
degeneracy of the world we live in. They love it. They love the Holy
Father and all the pomp and glory of all the politicians and kings
and rulers and the pusillanimous pictures of Bush kissing the ring of
the Holy Father. <br><br>What does that look like, for Nancy Pelosi,
speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi, in full color on the news, bowing
down and curtsying and bowing down and kissing the ring of a Roman
Pontiff? <br><br>The men who founded our great nation would throw up
with this treason, high crimes and treason against the state by these
people who call themselves America&rsquo;s leaders. I&rsquo;m telling
you, the Vatican has given us the Mafia, drug-running, prostitution,
terrorism, violence. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Child pornography. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Child pornography. All of it. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And the children that are
disappearing. Are you familiar with Leo Zagami? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Say it
again? <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Leo Zagami. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh yes. Yeah. I&rsquo;ve
heard him many times. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. He&rsquo;s gone back into
the fold because they tortured him. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yeah. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
But when he was out for a moment talking to us, he talked about
underneath the Vatican is a huge reptilian base. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know. I wasn&rsquo;t there, but it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me.
[laughs] <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Right. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 So there is some kind of linkup between the agenda of the
Illuminati, the Vatican who&rsquo;s heading all of that up, and this
reptilian roll-out &ndash; to get back to where we were talking about
and perhaps this so-called figure who&rsquo;s taking the throne and
the symbolism that you&rsquo;re talking about. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know, but it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me. It wouldn&rsquo;t shock me.
I want to say something about Dan Brown&rsquo;s movies. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
Okay. <I>Angels and Demons</I>, and the other one... <br><br>BR:&nbsp;
<I>DaVinci</I> Code. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; <I>DaVinci Code</I>, and now this
new one. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Is it really called the...? What we were...?
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s called <I>The Hidden Symbol</I> or
<I>The Secret Symbol</I>, or something like that, which my producer
friend and I were going to do a movie and we were going to call it
<I>The Hidden Secret</I> or <I>The Secret Symbol.</I> <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I
understand. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; And now Dan Brown comes out, the <I>Secret</I>...
As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I have no respect whatsoever for Dan
Brown. None. I have no respect for the man at all, because as far as
I&rsquo;m concerned, he&rsquo;s plagiarized and stolen and I don&rsquo;t
like people who steal, because I&rsquo;ve had it happen to me. <br><br>KC:&nbsp;
 He stole from <I>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</I>. Isn&rsquo;t that right?
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; Oh, you can bet on it. Absolutely. He stole the whole
thing, that whole story, Dan Brown and <I>The DaVinci Code</I> and
all this other... <I>Angels and Demons,</I> all of that he stole.
<br><br>Now let me tell you what I think. This is just my opinion. I
think Dan Brown is a plant. I think he&rsquo;s nothing more than a
paid lackey and a plant. I am totally sure that the real Illuminati,
whoever these guys are at the top of the world, use people like Dan
Brown, who don&rsquo;t mind making a lot of money to become a whore.
I think that&rsquo;s all he is. In my humble opinion, I think Dan
Brown is just a whore. He&rsquo;s just taking the money and sleeping
with the enemy. <br><br>I think what he&rsquo;s doing is he is
nothing more than presenting what his masters behind the scenes want
the public... and so they will spend all kinds of money telling you
about how wonderful Dan Brown is and <I>Oh my God! He&rsquo;s so
brilliant and intelligent</I>, and all this silly nonsense. And the
people who are so used to sucking up to Hollywood will believe that
stuff. <br><br>Me, I&rsquo;ve been around Hollywood 48 years. I know
this stuff backwards and forwards. I think Dan Brown is nothing more
than a front for a very powerful Masonic Order in Europe which is
trying to lay the foundations for this <I>Novus Ordo Seclorum</I>,
<I>Dawn of a New Day </I>sunrise-thing that&rsquo;s coming. I think
Dan Brown is nothing more than a whore taking the money and making it
look like he&rsquo;s the one that came up with this, when in point of
fact, no, it was stolen. It was stolen from three men in England:
Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Right. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Back in
1980, there was a book put out that became a New York best-seller for
many, many months. It was a top-of-the-line best-seller called <I>Holy
Blood, Holy Grail</I> and the three authors were three British
authors, Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln. <br><br>They outlined for the
first time, the story of the <I>Knights Templar Masonic Order</I> in
Europe, the Knights of the Holy Grail, the whole concept of a Masonic
secret society operating in the world. And I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit
surprised if they weren&rsquo;t better informed about this than what
they let us know. I don&rsquo;t think they just by chance happened
upon it. I think they already knew something and they were putting it
out in a book in such a way as to start people thinking about it.
<br><br>But nonetheless, Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln were
extraordinarily brilliant writers and their research was impeccable.
I mean, these guys nailed it down, and even today around the world,
people who are knowledgeable on these subjects will agree: Baigent,
Leigh, and Lincoln did one hell of a job; they had their homework
done. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. Well, I have one last question. <br><br>This
been an amazing journey to take with you, and I hope that we can go
down that road a little further in the future. I think that people
that are watching this really need to get up to speed with, you know,
following your other work, your previous work, hopefully attending
any conferences you&rsquo;re speaking at. I believe that you are
coming forward. You had no preparation whatsoever and you spoke at
our <I>Awake and Aware</I> Camelot Conference here in Los Angeles
just last weekend, and it&rsquo;s really an honor to be here with
you. <br><br>But I want to ask you if you think that this Illuminati
and what&rsquo;s going on in the United States right now, do you
really think that they are going to be successful in taking down this
country? Because it&rsquo;s clear that there is someone protecting
you, there is a group protecting you. You certainly have some amazing
powers, as you&rsquo;ve demonstrated. Do you think that these powers,
these Illuminati people behind the scenes are going to be successful
at taking down the United States government? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Yes. I
totally agree. Yes. That&rsquo;s what I think. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. I
mean, you do have people behind the scenes that are protecting you.
You&rsquo;ve demonstrated that time and time again on this video.
<br><br>JM:&nbsp; Right. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; They&rsquo;re, therefore, in theory,
protecting us here, Project Camelot, and other of our witnesses and
so on because we are all talking about the same thing from different
angles and getting our research together, and so on. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s right. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; But in essence what I&rsquo;m
wondering... There are white hats operating, as you know, and as we
know because we have been interacting with those people from time to
time. Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that these people can be
stopped? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; No. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
No. I do not. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I categorically say <I>No.</I>
I do not believe there is any reasonable evidence of anything of hope
for America or for the world. That&rsquo;s my personal opinion. I
think that the light at the end of the tunnel is a train coming.
<br><br>There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind, for myself. I do not
believe America or the world at large is going to be able to
extricate itself out of this situation. No. I do not believe it&rsquo;s
possible. <br><br>And the reason why is because the people are too
stupid. They&rsquo;re too ill-informed, ignorant, ill-informed,
un-read, self-centered, egotistical, materialistic, and down-right
stupid. And they don&rsquo;t care. Basically speaking, people don&rsquo;t
care. <br><br>Ludwig von Mises in one of these books, the great
European economist, Ludwig von Mises said -- and he&rsquo;s right-on
as far as I&rsquo;m concerned -- he said that in every age and in
every country, the people of every nation have always supported a
dictator. The people have <I>always</I> supported a dictator and they
always will. <br><br>There&rsquo;s never been a time in the history
of the human race that you can show me where the people of a nation
rose up and demanded their freedom, liberty, and justice for all, not
even in America. Ninety-seven percent of the male population in
America at the time of the American Revolution <I>did nothing</I>.
Only 3 percent took up arms against the British masters and gave us a
modicum of freedom. But happily that will never happen again. America
is finished. <br><br>DW:&nbsp; This father of the girlfriend that you had,
when he spoke to you, did he tell you that we&rsquo;re doomed? I
mean, why did he call in the UFOs and tell you all these things if we
were just going down the toilet? Did he tell you that we were doomed?
Did he tell you there was a war and that we were going to lose, no
matter what? <br><br>JM:&nbsp; No. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Okay. Let me rephrase
this: Do you realize that your mission and your call to arms, which
you&rsquo;re really coming right on the verge here &ndash; I mean, I
think that the new release of <I>V</I> is sort of a signal to the
populace, a last-ditch attempt to wake the people up as to what may
be coming &ndash; and basically you have a mission, we have a
mission. <br><br>I&rsquo;m sorry, you know, Jordan Maxwell, you&rsquo;re
a brilliant man, but you were put here for a reason. You have
incredible force behind you. The man who spoke to you all those years
ago and told you that you would have a journey is certainly behind
you now. I would say that, judging from everything that&rsquo;s gone
on with Project Camelot, that we have some of the same force behind
us. <br><br>And I have to say that the fact that you&rsquo;re sitting
here today, and you&rsquo;re talking to us, and you&rsquo;re alive
and well, and you&rsquo;re coming forward at this moment and talking
about things with really no holds barred, is indication to me that
there is something going on that&rsquo;s more than you have dreamed
of in your philosophy. So I want to thank you very much. <br><br>JM:&nbsp;
Well, I want to answer that question. I do not believe America can be
saved. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; I hear you. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I do not believe the
human race can be extricated or saved from what is coming. I do not
believe that my mission here is to save anybody. I believe what I am
doing is to help those who want to know, those handful of people who
are awakening and who sincerely spiritually understand the dynamics
of what&rsquo;s going on and who want to know and want to change and
want the protection of the spirit... That&rsquo;s a small modicum of
people, a very small niche. <br><br>I do not believe America can be
saved. I&rsquo;m doing what I&rsquo;m doing only to help those who
want to know. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Obviously you are a person who is trying
to wake up people. Okay? Sometimes there has to be a severe word told
to the people in order to actually get them to awaken and I do
believe that this is part of your mission. But I will thank you from
Project Camelot. I hope that you are wrong about your final judgment
on the human race. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; I do, too. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m
sure you do, too. <br><br>JM:&nbsp; Absolutely. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
trying to do whatever I can to help those who want to know and
hopefully it may spread. Thank you. <br><br>KC:&nbsp; Thank you. <br><br>
