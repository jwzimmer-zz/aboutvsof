Kerry
Cassidy
(KC):  Marcia Schafer herself is a contactee and a very gifted
intuitive; she has amazing gifts and information to share with you
from her contacts.


<br><br>


She&rsquo;s
written one book, <I>Confessions
of an Intergalactic Anthropologist,</I>
and it&rsquo;s available on her website which is <A HREF="https://www.beyondzebra.com/" target="_blank">www.beyondzebra.com</A>.


<br><br>


I&rsquo;ve
read her book. It&rsquo;s a fascinating book; it&rsquo;s well worth
the time. I encourage you to read it. It&rsquo;s a lovely, lovely
book. She&rsquo;s actually an old soul and I have to say that I know
her from other lives.

<br><br>


Anyway,
this is Marcia Schafer. She&rsquo;s also Bob Dean&rsquo;s partner and
I&rsquo;m not supposed to say that in the lead, I know, [Marcia
laughs] so I&rsquo;m saying it at the end of my introduction... I
want you to take note, Marcia Schafer.


<br><br>


She
is also an executive... I&rsquo;m not sure how you&rsquo;d term it,
maybe an executive coach. I&rsquo;m going to let her characterize
that herself.

<br><br>


Speak
to me, Marcia, and let&rsquo;s make sure that your mic is working.

<br><br>


Marcia
Schafer (MS):
 Hello everybody! [applause]

<br><br>


KC:
 Okay, Marcia, I&rsquo;ll let you take it from here.

<br><br>


MS:
 Okay. Well, thank you all for coming and thank you for having me.
When Kerry first invited me, I said: <I>You
know, I&rsquo;m not really so sure I should be here. I&rsquo;m really
not a whistleblower, I don&rsquo;t do conspiracy.</I>



<br><br>


AND
SHE SAID:  <I>No,
no, no, we want you to be a part of this.</I>



<br><br>


SO
I SAID:  <I>All
right, I&rsquo;ll give it a shot.</I>



<br><br>


So
with that we were supposed to put in our biographies and our
pictures, and I&rsquo;ve got to tell you I got a little bit upset
because I didn&rsquo;t get it in on time and Kerry and Bill went into
the old archives and pulled something themselves. And I just thought
it was totally inappropriate, but I&rsquo;m going to let you folks
decide as we begin to talk about metamorphosis.


<br><br>


So
this is what they put up of me and my bio [shows slide of a picture
taken behind her] [audience laughter] <I>Marcia
tried to rekindle her modeling career, but sadly in the intervening
years everything had gotten a bit pear-shaped</I>.
[audience laughter]


<br><br>


So
I learned to be on time with my stuff! [laughs]

<br><br>


Okay.
 What I&rsquo;m going to start with is an old Vedic saying. Well, all
right, it&rsquo;s not an old Vedic saying; I got it on the Internet.
But still it&rsquo;s good and it&rsquo;s worth sharing. It&rsquo;s a
story about the Bull and the Crow.
You may have heard it, but it&rsquo;s worth repeating, particularly
here and today. [showing a slide of the bull and the crow]

<br><br>


There
was the bull in a meadow that was watching an old crow stumble along
and he saw that the crow had no energy and was really struggling.


<br><br>


HE
WALKED OVER TO THE CROW AND HE SAID:  <I>Crow,
come here. I know how to fix what&rsquo;s wrong with you.</I>



<br><br>


THE
CROW LOOKED UP AT THE BULL AND SAID:  <I>What?</I>



<br><br>


AND
HE SAID: <I>You
just have to do what I say and you have to do it for three days
straight.</I>

<br><br>


THE
CROW LOOKED UP AT HIM AND HE SAID:  <I>Well...
okay.</I>



<br><br>


AND
THE BULL LOOKED DOWN AND HE SAID:  <I>All
right. You&rsquo;ve got to eat that.</I>



<br><br>


THE
CROW LOOKED UP AT THE BULL AND SAID:  <I>You&rsquo;re
kidding me, right?</I>



<br><br>


THE
BULL SAID:  <I>No,
crow, you must... for three days straight. </I>


<br><br>


CROW
SAID:  <I>I
am so not eating your poo, Bull!</I>



<br><br>


BULL
LOOKED DOWN AND SAID:  <I>Do
you want to get better? You must do it.</I>



<br><br>


SO
THE CROW SAID:  <I>I&rsquo;m
dying anyway -- what have I got to lose?</I>



<br><br>


For
three days he ate the feces from the bull, and at the end of three
days, you know what? The crow got strong and he was able to fly once
again to the highest trees.


<br><br>


So
he took off and he landed in this huge pine tree and right below him,
unbeknownst to him as he landed on the branch, along came a hunter.


<br><br>


THE
HUNTER HAPPENED TO LOOK UP, SEE THE CROW, GOES:  <I>I
hate those damn crows</I>.



<br><br>


POW!
Shot the crow...

<br><br>


And
the moral of the story: Bullshit can <I>take
you to the top, but it can&rsquo;t keep you there</I>.
[audience laughter]

<br><br>

And
I thought that there&rsquo;re so many people crowing about so much
bullshit these days that that was the perfect thing to open up with.
[audience laughter]
<br><br>

So
I mean, look, everybody is nervous these days. You&rsquo;re hearing
all this talk about 2012 and this old Mayan legacy that&rsquo;s been
left to us, and people are scared that Armageddon is just around the
corner.

<br><br>

Earth
changes &ndash; <I>Should
I head for the hills? Where should I go? Is there going to be water,
food? Where should I take my family</I>?
<br><br>

People
are giving you all their channeled information and their channeled
prophesies and telling you that <I>This
is the truth and we must do what I am saying because it&rsquo;s
coming from beyond.</I>
<br><br>

Extraterrestrial
invasions &ndash; People are telling you that all sorts of things are
about to unfold with extraterrestrials.


So
Kerry was trying to tell you what I do. I&rsquo;m actually a business
consultant of a very unusual type, because I also use my psychic
abilities and my experiences with extraterrestrial contact with
people in over 30 countries, helping them become humanitarian
pioneers.

<br><br>

But
I tell you, by the time they come to me they usually look like
this... [shows slide of a man freaking out, hands on the sides of his
face, screaming] from everything that&rsquo;s going on. [audience
laughter] It&rsquo;s a tough road for them to take.
<br><br>

So
as we begin to talk about things, what&rsquo;s really important to me
today and one of the biggest messages I can give you is that we have
to talk about: <I>What
is truth?</I>
Because everybody tries to give you their version of truth. You know,
who has the authority to say that they have the only version of it?

<br><br>

Your
job as you listen to each of us... just because we&rsquo;re up here
doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, and especially me. I have lived the life
I&rsquo;m about to tell you about and had the experiences I&rsquo;m
about to tell you about. I know they&rsquo;re real because I went
through it. You don&rsquo;t know me from Adam; you don&rsquo;t know
that.

<br><br>

You
have got to develop your discretionary abilities to a very, very high
level and just listen to everything and synthesize it into what may
make sense to you as we go forward.
<br><br>

Just
because you think an extraterrestrial may be the source, or some
channeled angel, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make it the barometer by
which you should live your lives. So question me in particular and
just look at it as a particular journey.

<br><br>

You&rsquo;ve
all had extraordinary experiences or been exposed to them to some
degree or you wouldn&rsquo;t be spending $150 bucks for this weekend,
I can assure you of that; so you know that a lot of this stuff is
going to be commonplace to some of you. But I just can&rsquo;t stress
enough how important it is that you all really just put on your truth
barometer and figure out what&rsquo;s right for you.
<br><br>

So,
what my job is, is to teach you to think <I>smartly</I>
because thinking smartly is a hybrid approach and it is using both
the intellect (the cognitive processes), and the wisdom of your
intuitive knowing.

<br><br>

This
may sound like some very nice New Age preachiness, but in my work
with people, as I&rsquo;m turning them on to putting on their higher
switches, this is something that we really get into because in the
human condition it&rsquo;s extraordinarily unique.

<br><br>

The
cognitive functioning, the intellectual reasoning that you have...
when you combine that with your eternal Soul-Mind and your eternal
Soul-Knowing, you have a very, very powerful tool to decipher
reality, but we don&rsquo;t flicker them on together all the time &ndash;
we use them separately, or one at the exclusion of the other. So I
want you to be thinking with your <I>head</I>
and your <I>heart</I>
at all times.
<br><br>

Now,
as we begin, we really need to be looking at... we&rsquo;re talking
about... God, you know, the <I>change</I>,
and all these things happening.

<br><br>

Are
these changing times right now? To some degree, yes, they are, but
we&rsquo;ve had change happening throughout history, but what&rsquo;s
unique is that we&rsquo;ve had change at an unprecedented level,
particularly over the past 50, 100 years.

<br><br>

Now,
we&rsquo;ve had beautiful green environments and healthy living, and
we&rsquo;ve turned around and we&rsquo;ve trashed it to where our
lifestyles are so polluted worldwide. Our food chain is tainted
beyond belief. Our breathing is fouled by the stench of horribly
putrid air, and everything that we touch, basically, is not in a very
good spot.
<br><br>

But
we&rsquo;re talking about, this weekend, change on an unprecedented
level that everybody&rsquo;s thinking that this amazing thing is
going to be happening, and happening very soon.

<br><br>

So
is there really any change that&rsquo;s going on for us? Yes, I&rsquo;d
say there is. I mean, you&rsquo;ve got to make up your own minds. I
know a lot of you already believe it, but I&rsquo;d say there is and
that it&rsquo;s on three levels.

<br><br>

Now
as I said, I&rsquo;m working with people in over 30 countries. These
are not people who you&rsquo;ll necessarily see to your left and your
right at a conference like this. These are everyday people who are
beginning to have some very profound things happen to them that they
are waking up to a new degree. They&rsquo;re having paranormal
experiences. Some are having extraterrestrial contact.

<br><br>

And
these are people that are in... you know, whether they&rsquo;re a
judge, a lawyer, an executive, a head of an agency, a doctor, a
biochemical researcher, a housewife bringing up six kids, you know, a
college student. I&rsquo;ve worked with people from 9 to 93. One of
my favorites is the 93-year-old. She sends me the dirtiest stuff on
the Internet, I just can&rsquo;t believe it! [laughs] She&rsquo;s a
hoot! But she&rsquo;s extremely aware and she actually had a very
prestigious occupation in her life.
<br><br>

So
something is going on in personal change because we&rsquo;ve come
from a very strong emphasis of getting more stuff &ndash; you know,
going to Macy&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re having a sale on Saturday &ndash;
to really taking time out to find that inner focus and what is
actually important to us.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
also seeing change on a social level. There are a lot of things
happening where... are the majority of people still going about, not
going paying attention? You betcha. But there is a tremendous stream
of awakening happening in everyday life, in every society, where
people are again beginning to look at things very differently.

<br><br>

And
you hear so much about the young. There&rsquo;re still the same old
kids doing the same old things that we did, but some of these
youngsters are extremely wise and extremely aware, and are talking
about things that I just never talked about when I was young and most
of my friends didn&rsquo;t either.

<br><br>

They&rsquo;re
looking at life with very sage, elder eyes. They know what they want
to do; they feel like they have a purpose to their life. At eight
years old they&rsquo;re going out and starting businesses and
beginning to do new things.
<br><br>

But
as we look at all this change, again I want to remind you that we&rsquo;ve
<I>always</I>
had change. You know, there was time where we would see the Vikings
come in on the shore and go: <I>Holy
cow! Sound the alarm!</I>
We&rsquo;d be afraid of the loss of our civilization and what was
happening. This is just another phase in our development.
<br><br>

But
there&rsquo;s another aspect to change. There&rsquo;s planetary
change. We&rsquo;re looking at things around us on the environment.

<br><br>

I
was really shocked to see the THIS [shows slide of the front page of
the NY Times] on the <I>New
York Times</I>,
August 9th, this headline... some of you may have seen it. Front
page: <I>Climate
change</I>.
Now, not only is it climate change, look what&rsquo;s below: <I>Seen
as threat to US security. Pentagon studies issue. Crisis may
destabilize regions and require military action.</I>
<br><br>

WHOA!!!
You know? [laughs] That&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d
see on Project Camelot! [laughs] So people are paying attention to
some degree to the planetary change, even though some still try to
deny it.

<br><br>

But
what is going on with this global warming? And is it something that&rsquo;s
happening here on the planet or is it something that could be further
on beyond? Because we tend to stop when we think about things, and we
tend to think about our direct parameters around us and the world.

<br><br>

But
what is going on out there in that unseen vast void of the universe?
We think of the world like this.... [shows slide of a normal-looking
Earth, then a slide showing electromagnetic fields around the Earth]
But there&rsquo;s all kind of fields and properties around the planet
that we really don&rsquo;t pay much attention to that we need to be
taking a look at that could be influencing us from beyond the borders
of our planet, and what&rsquo;s going on.
<br><br>

But
at the fundamental heart of this metamorphosis and this change that&rsquo;s
taking place is something that&rsquo;s a little bit different now,
and it&rsquo;s not necessarily a 2012 prophecy. It&rsquo;s not
necessarily extraterrestrial visitation.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
something very, very obvious and in front of us, and what is changing
are the perspectives that people have. We are now able to look at
things very differently because life has changed around us, so we
have new tools of interpretation.

<br><br>

When
I first came out, I think it was 12, 13 years ago, to publicly talk
about having a lifetime of extraterrestrial contact and what I
learned, there was still a bit of trepidation on behalf of people.
There were those people who said: <I>Yeah,
I think it&rsquo;s probably true. I want to hear what she has to say,
</I>and
there was still a great degree of people who didn&rsquo;t want to
hear anything.

<br><br>

But
now the majority of people are saying: <I>Well,
you know, I haven&rsquo;t had those experiences myself but I think
it&rsquo;s probably quite likely that it&rsquo;s out there,</I>
because we&rsquo;ve got media, we&rsquo;ve got technology, we have
all kinds of tools to help us reinterpret reality and what we&rsquo;ve
got going on around us.
<br><br>

So
we still have two camps. We have people who are looking at things
that [have] perspectives from the conventional eyes: the economy,
finances, mortgage institutions, politics, relationships,
powerbrokers, technology.
<br><br>

But
then we have people like who are looking at [an] unconventional world
in terms of what is it that science doesn&rsquo;t tell us? What is
really going on with space and solar activity? What&rsquo;s happening
out there with cosmic radiation and how does it affect us? I mean,
for gosh sakes, if a Sun, an orb billions of years away, can turn my
skin brown, then obviously if there&rsquo;s radiation fields and
activity out there that I&rsquo;m not aware of; it <I>can</I>
influence me, and influence me at depths and levels I&rsquo;m not
aware of.
<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
redefining extraterrestrial reality. So many of you are having your
own experiences, and we&rsquo;ve heard different interpretations
about human evolution and who we are and who we&rsquo;ve been.

<br><br>

Consciousness
is taking a radical new leap as we&rsquo;re looking at it beyond
Freud, beyond Jung, and into some new levels and some new depths as
you&rsquo;re exploring who you are and what you can do; and certainly
the historical redacts of looking at our history on this planet of
who we&rsquo;ve been and who we can be.
<br><br>

Quality
of life is taking precedence over some other things that are there,
like making money and having a 401K.

<br><br>

And
most importantly, there is a huge flow of your paranormal skill-set
being turned on within a subgroup of the population. It&rsquo;s not
happening with everybody, but it&rsquo;s happening with quite a few,
as you know in your own experiences that you&rsquo;re able to see,
know, and hear things and have extra abilities that were once
relegated to Jeane Dixon and just a few who were out there.
<br><br>

So
what am I doing with all of this information that has been given to
me? Because, as Kerry said, I&rsquo;ve had, as some of you may know,
kind of an odd lifetime and I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to learn a
lot of information &ndash; not from books, not from going to
conferences &ndash; but from extraterrestrials and entities who
aren&rsquo;t native to our planet.

<br><br>

Now
I&rsquo;ll tell you, if I hadn&rsquo;t had these experiences myself,
I&rsquo;d be looking at that woman up there and going: <I>She&rsquo;s
whacked; I just can&rsquo;t relate.</I>
But when they become personalized, then there&rsquo;s no doubt about
it, about what happened. And so I&rsquo;ve had a very unconventional
curriculum.

<br><br>

Some
of the things that I&rsquo;m going to briefly touch on today in the
time that we have are: I&rsquo;ve been introduced to the soul life as
a primary underlying force of our existence and being made to
understand that there is something more than just who we are.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
met &ldquo;the family&rdquo; in terms of many different species and
races out there.
<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
been introduced to some new things about genetics, consciousness,
looked at history in a way that hasn&rsquo;t quite been looked at
before.

<br><br>

And
most importantly, that has given me the understanding of what we&rsquo;ve
done a lot here on Earth and why we don&rsquo;t understand things, is
a new interpretation of what we call time-space.
<br><br>

This
is all leading up to what I have been taught is that... what the
future can be and that the future isn&rsquo;t set in stone.

<br><br>

And
so what I&rsquo;ve done is I am planting seeds of people around the
world rather than saying: <I>Buy
my book; read my book; oh I want to get on Oprah.</I>
Trust me, I do not want to get on Oprah and I don&rsquo;t want
anybody reading my book. It does not belong in Costco or any place
like that.

<br><br>

So,
you know, I&rsquo;ve decided to work with people on an individual
basis in giving them the seeds and the skills and the talent that
they need to be successful, to go forward and flower a new life.
<br><br>

Now
obviously, in the little amount of time we have, I can&rsquo;t cover
all those things but I&rsquo;m going to try to emphasize the soul
life, our futures, and planting seeds, along with some of these other
things.
<br><br>

Now,
you know when it comes to extraterrestrial reality, it&rsquo;s kind
of, for those of you who haven&rsquo;t had the direct contact,
there&rsquo;s kind of that &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do lunch&rdquo; kind of
attitude towards it.

<br><br>

I
get people calling me up or leaving messages saying: <I>Can
you arrange</I>...
it&rsquo;s almost like Match.com... <I>Can
you arrange for me to meet with an extraterrestrial</I>,
with a list of attributes that it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m running a
dating service. [laughter] It doesn&rsquo;t work that way! It doesn&rsquo;t
work that way at all.

<br><br>

You
know, there are so many different races out there that unfortunately
we tend to get confined to the beliefs that are fed to us by the
media. So we&rsquo;re used to the little Grays, you know, some
channeled information about reptilians, but don&rsquo;t be limited to
that. There are many, many different life-forms out there, some with
classical types of civilizations and cultures, and some who are way
beyond that.
<br><br>

The
slides that you&rsquo;re looking at now, these are life forms from
here. [showing slide of strange sea creatures] This is life from the
ocean. Now, tell me if that&rsquo;s not strange! You know, how can we
kind of look at what&rsquo;s out there and say: <I>Gosh
it just doesn&rsquo;t fit into my paradigm of reality?</I>


<br><br>

We
have all different types of life, and as I&rsquo;m going to hit on in
a little bit, that it&rsquo;s all sentient, and what I&rsquo;ve
learned &ndash; it&rsquo;s all conscious. Because as I&rsquo;ve
learned through my contacts with extraterrestrials, they also opened
up my capacity to communicate with the animal world and to realize
how sophisticated they are and what they have going on.
<br><br>

So
as we look at life that&rsquo;s around us, we can&rsquo;t really say
that this is really that much more strange.
<br><br>

Now,
I think we need to talk a little bit about their communication and
what they have to say because this is really important. What I want
to do is I want to give you some benefit of the wisdom that I&rsquo;ve
gained from working with a lot of different races.

<br><br>

I
think there&rsquo;s a joke in the universe &ndash; you know, it&rsquo;s
kind of like &ldquo;How does the chicken cross the road?&rdquo; &ldquo;How
do you get a human to do anything?&rdquo; [laughter] The answer is
play to his ego, tell him he&rsquo;s special, he&rsquo;s an
ambassador; we&rsquo;ll give him any appointment he wants... he&rsquo;ll
do anything we want. And this is so true.

<br><br>

You&rsquo;ve
so often seen people who&rsquo;ve been so enamored of having...
whether it&rsquo;s a channeled situation or they&rsquo;ve had a
contact face-to-face situation, and they get some information. They
go running out, they want to be on a talk radio show or they want to
be in the media and: <I>We&rsquo;re
going to have contact at 3 pm on August 12. It will be a meteor going
by, and if you look really hard, you&rsquo;ll see them.</I>
Over and over again, it never happens.
<br><br>

And
so what I have found, whether we like it or not, I feel that there&rsquo;s
almost like a fraternity hazing that goes on with some of us who have
this type of situation. Because when you find you don&rsquo;t
necessarily fall into that, and you question what&rsquo;s going on,
and you try to wake up your cognitive processing as you&rsquo;re in
this sometimes fugue state as you&rsquo;re with them, they gain...
they give you respect when you act a little differently and you show
you&rsquo;re independent and you don&rsquo;t necessarily fall in
line.
<br><br>

In
my situation what I encountered was all of a sudden I began to
receive some very advanced teachings about life, reality, humans &ndash;
what I call &ldquo;the wisdom track&rdquo;, and I felt very
privileged to be able to get that.

<br><br>

So
when you have the privilege of having an extraterrestrial encounter
experience, what I want you to know is that you can often fall into a
type of fugue state. It&rsquo;s like your Soul-Mind is coming on and
becoming active, but you need to keep that intellectual process open,
and keep your cognitive mind on and question, and not just accept
things as they come to you. And that&rsquo;s going to really make a
difference.

<br><br>

You
know, think about it. It&rsquo;s like when our researchers work with
gorillas, and you&rsquo;ve heard of Koko, the famous signing gorilla.
If you walk in and you&rsquo;re starting to work with Koko and all of
a sudden, she doesn&rsquo;t just say: <I>Red
ball,</I>
she says: <I>I
want carrot cake for dinner,</I>
you&rsquo;re
going to go: <I>Whoa!
I can go to a whole new level with this being</I>
and you can teach her at a more sophisticated level.

<br><br>

And
really, folks, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like sometimes with us,
is that when you go to a new level, they do too.
<br><br>

Okay,
what I want to do is share with you some of the messages that they
often bring because now I&rsquo;ve now told you to question their
messages, but what are some of the ones that they can share?

<br><br>

You
hear from everybody who has had contact, they&rsquo;ll talk a lot of
times about environmental concerns. Sometimes they&rsquo;ll have very
personal messages for people.
<br><br>

But
one of the things that happened to me after over five decades of
contact is when I was in my 40s, I had a very, very profound and very
different visit that changed my life.

<br><br>

It
was one week after what many of you here may know as the <I>Phoenix
Lights</I>
that happened on March 13, 1997. I live in Phoenix and I really
didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to them, even though they happened
over my house, but I had a contact visit a week later where they made
reference to that and they let me know that they had been there.

<br><br>

But
what they had, as I&rsquo;m going to distill it down, it was a very
profound, very long visit, but I&rsquo;m going to distill it down to
three particular messages, knowing that they have entrained me to
understand that the future is nothing more than a probability... the
future is mutable.

<br><br>

They
have helped me to understand, and this is so important for all of us,
that the future can be whatever we <I>will</I>
it and <I>want</I>
it to be. That&rsquo;s why we have to behave so differently and
become empowered.
<br><br>

They
talked about three things. They did talk about that there was going
to be what they called &ldquo;a Triune Setting,&rdquo; [this term is
the best that we understood it to be] that at some point in the
future...

<br><br>

And
I&rsquo;ve got to stop and tell you, you know, this drives me nuts,
because... the future... What? Next Thursday? 3012? You know, time is
different to them; they never really pin it down.
<br><br>

But
at some time in the future that there was going to be what they
referred to as a &ldquo;Portal Opening&rdquo; that would have great
significance for us.

<br><br>

Now,
I don&rsquo;t really, you know, get very involved in the 2012
phenomenon; I&rsquo;m very involved in today and just moving forward.
But I wonder because there&rsquo;s such a great astrological
configuration happening on that date that everybody&rsquo;s talking
about, if that&rsquo;s what they were referring to.
<br><br>

But
at some point they said this really does have significance because
it&rsquo;s an opening in and out of our Galaxy and our particular
place in the universe that has meaning, and it doesn&rsquo;t happen
but very rarely, in probably thousands and thousands of years.
<br><br>

They
also made reference to that in our time there was supposed to be the
discovery of records that would reveal a very different history on
our planet. They showed me pictures of what I thought were the
Egyptian pyramids and the Sphinx and that area, and they said that
when these are revealed there will be no refuting the history of the
extraterrestrial legacy.
<br><br>

I
can&rsquo;t imagine what would be on it because you can refute
anything and just say that it&rsquo;s myth and story and culture. But
they said that there was something there.
<br><br>

I&rsquo;ll
tell you, since that happened over ten years ago when that particular
visit happened, I also now wonder something very differently about
this. I wonder if, actually, this may not be Egypt, but it may
actually be a part of the ancient Atlantean lands that are down by
Bermuda and Florida being able to rise up and have some of these
monoliths on them. It&rsquo;s just a thought that I&rsquo;ve had.
<br><br>

The
third thing they said is something that they don&rsquo;t want to have
happen, and at that time they were very, very concerned about a
nuclear detonation going off in what seemed to be the Middle East
region. So far, ten, twelve years later, we&rsquo;re doing good. It
hasn&rsquo;t gone off.

<br><br>

But
what they said was that it&rsquo;s going to be a very naive situation
should the nuclear detonation take place, because that there&rsquo;s
a major fault-line and if it does it&rsquo;s going to trigger this
and therefore it&rsquo;s going to affect the quality of life... <I>For
everyone on your planet, and it won&rsquo;t be contained to a
particular singular region like you saw when you detonated the bomb
before.</I>
<br><br>

So
these are the nature of some of the messages and some of the things
that they can tell you and share with you.

<br><br>

Now,
I&rsquo;m saying this because are these true? I don&rsquo;t know. I
find them fascinating. I find them interesting and I&rsquo;m very
proud that I&rsquo;ve had the privilege to hear them from them. But I
also know that it doesn&rsquo;t mean that any of them are necessarily
going to happen, that they&rsquo;re potentials for our future that
can have greater bearing on us and what comes to fall for us.
<br><br>

The
other thing they shared... and I know I&rsquo;m going fast but I only
have so much time and so I&rsquo;ll be available later to go into
greater depth of all these things... is that they told me about our
past in a very different way.
<br><br>

What
they did is they said that: <I>Yes,
you were a genetically-altered species...</I>
and I learned about this way before any of this came out into the New
Age culture. They said that: <I>It&rsquo;s
a little different than you think, though.</I>
<br><br>

They
taught me about Zecharia Sitchin, who many of you have heard of,
before I was even aware of who the man was. They told me to go
explore his work because they said he&rsquo;s very close to what it
was.

<br><br>

And
they said after I explored it, that: <I>You&rsquo;re
a hybrid race, but it&rsquo;s not just that you had this Anunnaki
coming here who created you.</I>


<br><br>

They
said: <I>What
it is, is you&rsquo;re actually a mixture of twelve genetic strains</I>
of what we would call extraterrestrial DNA and that when the
life-form was tinkered with, it wasn&rsquo;t one cultural life-form
overlaying its presence, it was a genetic mixture.

<br><br>

They
went into some very interesting details about it with the science
that was used where what I call <I>harmonic</I>
or <I>sonic
resonance</I>
was used to... This may sound like total meta-poop; I know, because I
have scientific background, but it&rsquo;s interesting so I&rsquo;m
going to share it.

<br><br>

They
said that a sonic resonance... they used actually sound frequency
when they were doing the genetic tinkering to get the strains to gel
and to work with each other.
<br><br>

So
what all this does is it allows us to look at what we know with new
eyes and to think: <I>Well,
maybe; that definitively could be</I>.
And hopefully what it will do is will eventually entrain conventional
traditional science, the renegades who are working within the fringe,
to start looking along these new lines.
<br><br>

Because
we know that it&rsquo;s not a question of Darwinism or Creationism &ndash;
both have aspects and flaws within them &ndash; that it&rsquo;s
something else, and it&rsquo;s probably not just a third alternative
but multiple. And when you look at extraterrestrial presence on this
planet and the fact that there was probably genetic tinkering, it
certainly seems to make a lot of sense to me.

<br><br>

What
is really intriguing to me is how they went about all of this, and
the way that they gave me this really new curriculum. It wasn&rsquo;t
necessarily sitting down in a lecturing situation; it was a lifetime
of experiences that I had that I couldn&rsquo;t synthesize and didn&rsquo;t
realize that they were all coming together to have a focused meaning
until I was in my 30s, and I&rsquo;d been going through this since I
was in the crib.
<br><br>

What
they did was they actually took me to experience certain things where
I would actually be taken and I&rsquo;d be witnessing... I don&rsquo;t
know whether it was a hologram or a point in space-time that was in
the past, but I&rsquo;d be witnessing and looking at a group of
workers who were working under another race. I now later realize they
were showing me that man actually had been used for some slave
potential on this planet and had been harnessed for his capacity to
help... well, &ldquo;help&rdquo; is a generous word, isn&rsquo;t
it?... to help another species.
<br><br>

So
the point is that it&rsquo;s not what you expect. It&rsquo;s not like
going to Starbucks and it&rsquo;s not like just sitting down and they
teach you, but they can have a very unique process to get you to
understand a new system of reality and a new way of thinking, and it
can be very, very experiential.
<br><br>

So
those are just some of the things that I have been through with them.


<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;m most interested now is not really what&rsquo;s going on
with me, but what&rsquo;s going on with the culture and the way that
we&rsquo;re trying to get this out.

<br><br>

If
you look at [shows slide with cowboys, Daniel Boon-types&hellip; and
ETs ]... I love this ad from New Mexico. The New Mexican tourist
industry got a lot of flack for this: <I>The
best place in the Universe, New Mexico, Earth.</I>

And if you look closely, you see that they&rsquo;ve integrated the
extraterrestrial persona of their state in there, which I think is
very intriguing.
<br><br>

And
if you go along now and you go into the modern culture, people, as I
said, are really accepting more and more of what&rsquo;s out there.
<I>Am
I&rsquo;m going crazy? Was this place Korean just last week?</I>
[audience laughter]
[shows
slide of a cartoon of confused shoppers in a little,
formerly-Korean-run store] You know, this is pretty much what we&rsquo;re
looking at and what we&rsquo;re facing.
<br><br>

Okay.
So you know, as I mentioned before, what for me has been really
beneficial about the extraterrestrial contact is that it&rsquo;s
given me new insights into not just human behavior, but something
bigger. It&rsquo;s given me insights into where humanity fits within
other species. You know, because in some ways, we are just those
crazy flesh-eating mammals with herd-like tendencies, and we tend to
forget that. We tend to put ourselves at the top of the apex so that
we&rsquo;re the ultimate supreme species and we&rsquo;re a deity.
<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;ve learned through how extraterrestrials communicate...
because they use holographic processes. They will often send an image
to you that has an accompaniment of instant knowing, and that this
goes on in the animal world too.

<br><br>

Inter-species
communication is somewhat universal, and human beings use language,
and ordered thought processes, that does not seem to be communal to
the rest of what is out there.
<br><br>

When
we begin to penetrate into the species that are here beside us and
the animal kingdom and understand how <I>sophisticated</I>
their thought processes are and how much they know of what goes on...
that they have their own cultures and relationships with each other,
and they&rsquo;re not that different from us... it allows us to
integrate better with the concept of extraterrestrial reality.
<br><br>

Because
I tell you, people are much more likely &ndash; not you, but the
average person &ndash; is much more comfortable looking at the fuzzy
little animal (on the top) that talks [showing slide of a pair of
house cats]  than extraterrestrial reality and since I do both, let
me tell you, the ordinary people like the fuzzy little animals a lot
better.

<br><br>

So
what you&rsquo;ll learn and what the power of us... And love what
Gandhi had said. You know, people put it at the end of their Internet
messages, that: <I>The
moral fiber of a nation is judged by how it treats its animals</I>,
or something like that.

<br><br>

That
really is at the underpinning of our moving forward, is understanding
that we are a collaborative species, that humans are not cut out
apart the way that we set ourselves to, that we have to understand
that we&rsquo;re one of a multiple order, and that order... well, it
goes off into the space realms... has to start right here at home. We
have to start paying better attention to what goes on -- on the
planet and how we are treating our animals.
<br><br>

Now,
I said I had an interesting curriculum. One of the very profound
things that they started early with was the concept of reincarnation.


<br><br>

Now,
much of the world... if you ask any Buddhist they say: <I>Sure,
no problem; got it, its part of our culture.</I>
The Western world still has a problem with this. Reincarnation is
something that, while there is a lot of different type of evidence
for it, can&rsquo;t always necessarily be proved empirically.

<br><br>

But
what they did with me is, starting when I was 12, 13, 14 years old,
they would come at night and I&rsquo;d be pulled out and I would sit
there and I would watch myself in these different existences. I would
watch and I would see myself as...

<br><br>

I
was a tall thin black man in ancient Africa who was swept upon a
leopard and became part of the food chain. I saw myself as a slave in
ancient Egypt &ndash; I looked down at my feet and I saw the hard
ground that I slept on and the straw. I saw myself as being buried
alive with a man who was my husband because I was part of his
property.

<br><br>

All
these things where I was dying and had left my body, because they
were trying to get across the idea that we have an eternal soul and
that they needed me to know not to be afraid, that no matter what
happened in this lifetime, that wasn&rsquo;t <I>it</I>;
it&rsquo;s a part of the journey.

<br><br>

And
with that, I was able to go forward and tackle life with a very
different perspective than if I had been terrified and afraid: <I>Oh,
I&rsquo;m going to die.</I>
We&rsquo;re <I>all</I>
going to die. We just don&rsquo;t know when, you know, and we&rsquo;re
born, we&rsquo;ve lived, we&rsquo;ve died time and time again. We
just don&rsquo;t tend to remember it.
<br><br>

When
it comes to reincarnation, what I think is so important about it is
that not only does it remind us of the eternalness of our being, but
it allows us to sometimes look at life with some new eyes and provide
some different answers.
<br><br>

One
of the things that I was left with is the ability to look at somebody
and I can immediately see their Soul and I can see the trail of the
reincarnations that they&rsquo;ve had.
<br><br>

Now,
a lot of people say: <I>Oh,
we shouldn&rsquo;t get caught up in it; we belong in the here and
now.</I>
I agree in that wholeheartedly, but sometimes it gives us different
eyes to look at things differently.
<br><br>

A
woman I worked with just a few weeks ago and as I talked to her and
explained to her the most prominent series of visions around her was
one in the 1800s in England and how she was involved in the early
labor union development, and how the smog and the soot just assailed
her and she couldn&rsquo;t stand it; and she was so frustrated by
what was happening with the businesses and how they were taking
advantage of the people at that time.

<br><br>

At
the end she laughed and she said: <I>Well,
I&rsquo;m not so sure there&rsquo;s anything to this or not but I
actually got my Masters degree in studying labor law in England and I
have a real issue with the pollution. </I>

<br><br>

And
you will see that there are commonalities and carryovers and tie-ins.
Usually the lives that surround you now are often the leftover issues
that we&rsquo;re still dealing with that we&rsquo;ve pulled together.
And if you can pull it together with your soul purpose and go forward
and integrate it into your life as you move forward, then you
work-life can become your life-work.
<br><br>

So
for me the experience of working with the extraterrestrials, and the
whole journey of reincarnation, had a real profound impact because it
wasn&rsquo;t just about my journey, but it was about working with
other peoples&rsquo; journeys, too.

<br><br>

So,
yeah, we can&rsquo;t get caught up in it. It doesn&rsquo;t really
matter if you were Genghis Khan or Cleopatra. Who cares? But what
really matters is: What is your personal journey and what do you have
to do now as you go forward?

<br><br>

Now,
leading to this and that we&rsquo;re eternal beings, the most
important thing I&rsquo;ve gotten from these experiences is that
there <I>is
</I>actually
a &ldquo;science of the soul&rdquo;, and a lot of the things that
happen to us are because of this.

<br><br>

But
as humans... well, if we&rsquo;re not even really acknowledging that
there really is a soul, how are we going to begin to even uncover and
uncap this science? And I&rsquo;ve learned some fascinating things
from them.
<br><br>

Now,
this is where you put your hat on and decide. Even though I&rsquo;m
speaking authoritatively, don&rsquo;t let it fool you. [laughs] You
have to decide for yourself whether it&rsquo;s true or not.
<br><br>

From
what I have learned, the human being is a unique experience that&rsquo;s
a symbiont experience. There is this <I>energetic
electric residue</I>,
if you want to call it, that comes in and binds with the biological
unit, and there are two dual-operating systems that coexist &ndash;
which I think is interesting.

<br><br>

If
you know anything about the human body, you know you have the
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems which work together.
One controls the powerful things like blinking, heart beating,
respirations.
The other one says: <I>I
think I&rsquo;m going to move my hand and stroke my hair, and I want
to eat, and I&rsquo;m going to do some more complex operations</I>
<br><br>

Apparently
there are two systems that learn to coexist in our body, and one is
the one that is related to the biological unit.

<br><br>

When
we become activated and our soul gets turned on more as a primary
listening-point, then that operating system comes into greater power.
It gives you greater discipline, and it gives you greater
understanding, and greater control to move forward as a more evolved,
willful human being.
<br><br>

Now,
there&rsquo;s a whole... Obviously we don&rsquo;t have time for this,
you know, how the soul binds and how it separates. But the one
interesting thing that I think is really pertinent that I want to
mention is that a lot of you have heard about with extraterrestrial
experiences [that] people become paralyzed and they can&rsquo;t move.
<br><br>

What
they showed me is that many of the races know how to actually
disengage the soul from the biological unit.
<br><br>

What
they do, as they&rsquo;ve explained to me, is that they actually can
come in and through their abilities they can rotate your nervous
system &ndash; they can disengage it a little bit. What they say is
they just turn it a little bit so your synaptic junctions do not line
up and you&rsquo;re not able to control your body, and therefore
that&rsquo;s where the paralysis comes in.

<br><br>

Again,
I don&rsquo;t know if this is true. I have some medical and
scientific background but not to that extent, but I think it&rsquo;s
really interesting and I think it merits further exploration as we
look into the new types of sciences that we should be exploring.
<br><br>

So,
for those of you who have those paralytic-type
of encounters, oftentimes that&rsquo;s what happens. Or [if] you come
back from a lucid dream and you slam back into your body and you
can&rsquo;t really move for a while, the alignment hasn&rsquo;t taken
place.
<br><br>

The
reason I&rsquo;m sharing these types of things is that I want you to
just look at life differently and say that there&rsquo;s many
different explanations for all these crazy things that can happen out
there. Some of them might make sense and might actually be proven if
we move in the right direction in science.
<br><br>

So
there&rsquo;s this whole science of the soul that provides a lot of
explanation for what happens and why it happens that we have yet to
uncover, and once we do, things are going to make a lot more common
sense.
<br><br>

The
other thing is learning about that space and time and dimensions
don&rsquo;t coincide with our traditional understanding. I mean, why?
The human has an orientation and why we just don&rsquo;t get it is
because we think linear. We think <I>up</I>;
we think <I>down</I>.
We think <I>left/
right</I>,
<I>east/west,
north/south.</I>
And because of that we have to learn to think more <I>inside</I>
and <I>outside</I>
and move in a different direction.
<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
going to go really fast now because I just got the warning sign.

<br><br>

All
right, I want to talk to you real quickly and let you know that with
time-space and reality that there is something called a <I>nodal
point</I>
and when you hear about people talking about <I>attraction</I>
and things coming to you, part of it is tied into this.

<br><br>

What
we&rsquo;re able to do is we&rsquo;re able to get ourselves to this
crux of time-space energy where everything can flow out, and you can
do this through your consciousness. What happens is, when you get
yourself to the power of this nodal point and you start thinking in a
conscious direction, you can redirect the flow of the futures that
come to you.
<br><br>

All
right. So why are things happening now? Because, my friends, we have
these new eyes and capacity to reinterpret the world. Life used to be
like that... life is now like this... [refers to slide that shows the
famous &ldquo;American Gothic&rdquo; painting by Grant Wood in 1930;
next to the classic painting is a re-creation of the painting, but
with the farmer and wife talking on cell phones and the farmer has a
golf club instead of the pitchfork] because we have technology.,
Technology has given us the insider course to the answers for many of
the things that were not able to be understood before... and so, our
ancient alchemists are really today&rsquo;s modern scientists.
<br><br>

So
what I&rsquo;ve done for that first part is I&rsquo;ve given you a
preview of what it&rsquo;s been like and some of the things that I&rsquo;ve
learned. Obviously I can&rsquo;t dump 50-plus years into the course
of 45-minutes-to-an-hour, but I wanted to give you a little bit of
insight into what it&rsquo;s been like for me.
<br><br>

But
now I&rsquo;m more interested in something far more important. It&rsquo;s
not about me... it&rsquo;s about you. And this is what I want to
spend the last 15 minutes talking to you about.
<br><br>

You
all have come here and you&rsquo;ve all talked to yourself about, you
know: we&rsquo;ve got this mission, we&rsquo;re awakening [and] we
feel special.

<br><br>

You
have a new job assignment and it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re this
great prophet or anything. You&rsquo;re really door-holders; you&rsquo;re
in concierge services.

<br><br>

If
you want people to think differently and be open to your ideas, you
need to just gently introduce them to it in a way that&rsquo;s
palatable to them. And that&rsquo;s what your responsibility is.
Besides your own journey of awakening, you&rsquo;re also here for
other people.

<br><br>

This
[shows a series of slides of skyscrapers in cities] is how humans
tend to see the world. They tend to see it in their suburban
background, in their isolated houses, in their little communities,
and then their cities and they stay within their viewpoints. You
never even get them to look up into the sky hardly at all to see
what&rsquo;s going [on] there. So we see ourselves as this contained
globe.

<br><br>

BUT...
how <I>you</I>
see the world is different because you see it with the power of
metamorphosis and the power of change and of infinite possibility and
you know that what&rsquo;s been fed to us isn&rsquo;t necessarily
what&rsquo;s real.
<br><br>

So
your new job description is Metamorphosis and that you&rsquo;re
Change-Agents of a new degree because you&rsquo;re dealing with
extraterrestrial reality and human higher consciousness. And you have
to do it in a way that you do not appear disenfranchised, you do not
appear alienated from them, that they&rsquo;re able to listen to you
and they want to listen to you.
<br><br>

I
mean, I&rsquo;ve had this crazy background and extremely far-out and
I&rsquo;ve been very, very successful walking into many different
countries, many different corporations, many different businesses,
many different people, and have been able to give people some very
strong tools for progressing forward.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
all about the way that we communicate and the way that we do it. So I
need you to understand something about your audience because I want
you to have some tangible tools as you move forward.
<br><br>

This
is who you&rsquo;re working with on the planet now. [shows slide with
the &ldquo;EL&rsquo;s, OH&rsquo;s and EM&rsquo;s ] I tend to call it
&ldquo;Alphabet Demographics&rdquo;: <I>EL&rsquo;s,
OH&rsquo;s, and EM&rsquo;s</I>
<br><br>

Okay,
the EL&rsquo;s are what you&rsquo;d consider yourself: <I>Enlightened
Luminaries</I>.
You know, you&rsquo;ve seen it all... extraterrestrial, paranormal
experiences. You&rsquo;re in tune with those who connect with you in
the unseen world on the other side. Nothing fazes you and you&rsquo;re
well aware on the pathway.
<br><br>

The
OH&rsquo;s are what I call the <I>Ordinary
Humans</I>.
These are the people who are still out there. They may be interested
in what Oprah has to say; they think all this is kind of interesting.


And
in that group is the <I>Emerging
Human</I>,
the [noise or sound unclear]
and
those emerging humans, those are the people who are &ldquo;retarded&rdquo;
in terms of making headway with them, that they would be willing to
hear you if you communicate appropriately with them. This is what...
<br><br>

Kerry
once interviewed me and I called them &ldquo;the swing vote&rdquo;.
These are the people who are looking to know more about what&rsquo;s
out there, are fed up with what they&rsquo;ve been told because it no
longer fits the world as they see it, but they need to have it
packaged in a way that they can accept and is understandable to them.
<br><br>

This
is where it is incumbent upon us to stop thinking about ourselves:
<I>Oh,
I do this; and I read this book; and I have this; and have you heard
about this</I>...
and to sit down, shut up, and listen to them and to start
understanding where they come from, acknowledging who they are.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
not about you. It&rsquo;s about you extending your hand and saying: <I>I
hear you, you know. I have some things to offer,</I>
instead of overpowering them with what we have encountered on our
journeys and what we know because they have some extraordinary things
to share. These are the people who are going to determine our future.
<br><br>

We,
of course, do have the EM&rsquo;s, <I>the
Elementary Man,</I>
who is what I call <I>the
funda-mental,</I>
which I think is an appropriate word for them. These are the people
who are greatly filled with intolerance because they don&rsquo;t want
you challenging their paradigm. If you come forward with your ideas,
and what you know, and the things we&rsquo;re talking about here this
weekend, you&rsquo;ve just violated their world and their sanctity.
That is something that they just won&rsquo;t tolerate and will create
a very difficult life for you.
<br><br>

I
got this on the Internet. [show slide of this map]
I
don&rsquo;t know who to attribute it to. It&rsquo;s one of the most
brilliant things I&rsquo;ve ever seen &ndash; <I>The
World According to Americans.</I>
[google this and see the map &ndash; it&rsquo;s hilarious]
<br><br>

America:
We&rsquo;re Number One; We&rsquo;re Number One. Eastern and Western
Europe is, you know, <I>pussies</I>
and <I>communists</I>.
Coffee comes from South America. We only know Australia&rsquo;s
kangaroos. [audience laughter] You know, the polar cap&rsquo;s
cold... Santa!
<br><br>

This
is really how most of America sees things and I&rsquo;d love to give
credit to whoever it came from but it came through anonymously.
Evil-doers (Even though there&rsquo;re) bombs going here, you know...
[points to the Middle East] Mexico and South America, they do our
laundry and lawns. [audience laughter] You know? This is what we&rsquo;re
dealing with, and you&rsquo;ve got to remember and you&rsquo;ve got
to respect &ndash; this is their world too.
<br><br>

Okay.
So your tools are... remember -- it&rsquo;s all about perspectives,
and while this looks like a nice little design, [shows slide of an
elephant skin] this is actually elephant skin. And so your tools are
to show people that it&rsquo;s not what it seems, there&rsquo;s
something deeper underneath it.
<br><br>

And
so your approach is the &ldquo;New 3-Rs&rdquo;, which is not reading,
&lsquo;riting, and &lsquo;rithmetic. This is something I work with
people in great depth with, and this is important.

<br><br>

You
have to make yourself <I>relevant</I>.


<br><br>

You
know, if you&rsquo;re just sitting there on your commune and you&rsquo;re
just working with your own little sphere, it&rsquo;s not going to
work. You have to come into today&rsquo;s world if you really want to
be a change-maker. You have to do things within today&rsquo;s 21st
century and make yourself relevant to today&rsquo;s culture and
society.
<br><br>

You&rsquo;ve
got to be <I>realistic</I>.


<br><br>

You&rsquo;ve
got to look at what you&rsquo;re working with for the second &ldquo;R&rdquo;.
You have got to not just say: <I>Well,
you know, the aliens are going to be here on Sunday; </I>or:<I>
I&rsquo;m channeling them and you want to come hear them.</I>
You&rsquo;ve got to be realistic with who you&rsquo;re working with
and what you&rsquo;re dealing with, and you need to speak to them in
those appropriate terms.
<br><br>

But
most importantly, my friends, you&rsquo;ve got to be <I>relatable</I>.


<br><br>

You
have got to be able to be somebody that they&rsquo;re willing to look
at, and to listen to, and to not be necessarily bringing your stuff
on them, but you&rsquo;re entering into their world.

<br><br>

Two
thousand years ago you had a great teacher here and a lot of the
teachings that were really <I>relevant</I>
were lost.

<br><br>

One
of the things I will share with you, which you can dismiss or accept,
is that there was a group that he worked with, and in this group, he
taught them the ways of the common ordinary man. He taught them about
their behaviors and he taught them how to go forward, not just in
this lifetime but in their future lifetimes, as effective <I>messengers</I>,
messengers who will open the door, messengers of change... and in
doing that, you have to be relatable. As you read your old-time
readings, you will read about the ancient Essenes, how they would
change their robes when they went into town so they matched what the
people were wearing.

<br><br>

So
these three &ldquo;Rs&rdquo; are things I want you to remember. And
so, you know, the change that is happening, as I heard y&rsquo;all
talking about it before...  it&rsquo;s true.

<br><br>

<I>Enough
with all the spiritual mumbo-jumbo, Pal. What I&rsquo;m seeking is
real interchange,</I>
said the piggybank to the guru. [showing a cartoon of a coin piggy
bank sitting in front of a guru]
<br><br>

The
change is <I>us</I>.
When <I>we</I>
change, <I>everything</I>
changes. It starts within us, each and every one of us, and it has a
great cascading effect.
<br><br>

Now,
I&rsquo;ve got to say this before I finish up. The other part of
metamorphosis is financial, and that you have to realize that we&rsquo;re
no longer these spiritual monks walking along with an alms bowl
saying: <I>I&rsquo;ll
teach you for a dinner.</I>


<br><br>

We
have a lot of hang-ups about money and finances and, you know, it&rsquo;s
particularly apt now because of the state of the world. What we have
to realize is that this is how we flex our collective arm on this
planet, through financial maneuverings and money.
<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
not <I>money</I>
that&rsquo;s bad. It&rsquo;s getting hung up on money. It&rsquo;s the
key of loving money, of wanting, you know, amassing millions and
billions, and living for a 401K instead of quality of life. So you&rsquo;ve
got to get over this poverty consciousness of: <I>I&rsquo;m
spiritual, I&rsquo;m good, I&rsquo;m poor.</I>
<br><br>

What
is important for us is to be independent functioning members of
society, moving society forward. So it&rsquo;s the love of money, not
getting caught up in it, that is a critical tool for us to become
financially aware and not have a hang-up if somebody wants to pay you
for your services and that you have a right to earn a living. Okay.
So it&rsquo;s sound spiritual economics.

<br><br>

And
what I want to show you is that it&rsquo;s no longer where we just
used to be the wizard in the woods is what we were looking for, for
this magic change is that <I>this</I>
[shows slide of bright points of light in a dark forest] is the
everyday change-agent now. You may not like it, but a lot of you are
actually still back in the traditional avenues making headway and
making change.
<br><br>

Not
everybody comes to these types of things who are making a difference
on the planet and there have been a lot of people who are out there
developing new businesses, new technologies and doing the really hard
grunt work that&rsquo;s going to carry us all forward.

<br><br>

Sometimes
they still look like they used to, but you know, that with people in
change [loses cable connection to slides &ndash; deleted as not
relevant] sometimes they look like this. So sometimes that
businessman is really somebody very profound who&rsquo;s back once
again.

<br><br>

And
so what I&rsquo;m choosing to do with all the knowledge that I&rsquo;ve
had, rather than sitting down writing books and doing this type of
thing, is I&rsquo;m looking at people and I&rsquo;m giving them very
new tools to change.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
helping them on their incarnational trek to become aware of who they
were but how it has relevance to today; looking at their soul lessons
and then repositioning them in a business-type and
entrepreneurial-type of venture around the world; planting those
human seeds of change and giving them the practical vision and skills
that they need to be able to function in the world as it now exists.
It may not be the one that you like. It may not be the one that you
want. It&rsquo;s the one that we have.
<br><br>

And
so they&rsquo;re doing some very amazing things, you know, and I love
this quote: <I>Success
in almost any field depends more on energy and drive than it does on
intelligence because this explains why we have so many stupid
leaders.</I>
[laughter]
<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
trying to get rid of the stupid leaders and we&rsquo;re trying to put
in the people who can make a difference and understand the synthesis
of what is going on on the planet and that we need to move forward.
<br><br>

What
we&rsquo;re seeing mostly around the world are lifestyle communities
being built up, different ways of bringing up and educating the
children, food production changes, and a total reeducation such as
you&rsquo;re doing here with Project Camelot.
<br><br>

Now,
as I get ready to leave you, I want you to know one thing and this is
what has been made very clear to me by those who visit us and those
who teach, is that we are here together. We have a group
incarnational lesson and if we don&rsquo;t pull this off, things most
likely aren&rsquo;t going to be as optimal for us as they could be.
<br><br>

What
that group incarnational lesson is: Stop saying: <I>You
read </I><I>Urantia</I><I>.</I><I>
You read Jane Roberts. You know, I don&rsquo;t believe in this. </I>

<br><br>

We
have to look at each other and see the soul-lights within each other
and see who we are as a collective group. We have to truly, as
clich&eacute;d as it sounds, see the love in each other or it&rsquo;s
going to... stop being kind of pissy with each other and deciding: <I>I
don&rsquo;t like this; I&rsquo;m judging this</I>.
We don&rsquo;t have time for that anymore.

<br><br>

There
is a very short timeframe environmentally it looks like, doesn&rsquo;t
it, for us to make some things differently.

<br><br>

And
so it&rsquo;s all about seeing the soul-light and networking with
each other in a way that you never have before, making each other
smarter, and sometimes that networking involves a little bit of a
different partner, doesn&rsquo;t it?
<br><br>

You
really are your brother&rsquo;s keeper. This is what they told me.
That old biblical clich&eacute;... in this time, in this frame, it
has never been truer. You have to take care of yourself, but now
you&rsquo;re just as responsible for the other person; not: <I>Well,
it&rsquo;s just my stuff and my path</I>.


<br><br>

Yes,
I said it&rsquo;s up to each of us to change to make the change; now
we have to form the chain-link. Now we have to come out and work
together and do it in a way that&rsquo;s very smart.

<br><br>

The
real secret behind all this -- if you want to make a difference -- is
people who do great things don&rsquo;t take <I>NO</I>
for an answer. They just go ahead and they forge and they find the
resources and know what needs to be done.
<br><br>

They
also understand the power of kindness and you&rsquo;ll learn that
it&rsquo;s far better to be kind than to be right. Being kind in
business and being kind as you go forward in your ventures has
greater weight than anything else you&rsquo;ll ever do.

<br><br>

And
most importantly we have to realize it&rsquo;s not an
extraterrestrial that&rsquo;s going to save us; it&rsquo;s not an
angel. People who do great things know that man alone has the power
to work out his destiny in combination with his own intelligence &ndash;
that hybrid approach again, of the spirit, the soul, and the
cognitive reasoning.
<br><br>

So
when we talk about thinking outside the box, we&rsquo;re now taking
it to a new level in terms of what the box is, you know. You folks
already are thinking way outside the box.

<br><br>

So
when I look at metamorphosis, remember [that] behind the change on
this planet is a change in perspective. Your ability to see things
differently, along with other peoples&rsquo; capacity to now listen
to the things you have to say, is rooted &ndash; a lot &ndash; in
science, technology, and advances bringing us to a new world.

<br><br>

So
I love to end with this saying: <I>Brave
men earn the right to shape their own destiny</I>
by Arthur Schlesinger, and I like to put my own little twist on it.
To all my little sisters out there: <I>Brave
women earn the right to shape their own destiny.</I>
<br><br>

So,
I know that I left out a lot because we had some difference in the
time changes. I know I went fast in some areas, but what I&rsquo;m
going to say to you is I want to thank you so much for giving me the
chance to bring you a little view of what I&rsquo;m doing out there
in the world to try to make a difference.

<br><br>

As
I say, I&rsquo;m going to be here if you want to talk to me and get
some more detail on the things that I just quickly glossed over.
<br><br>

So
thank you for allowing me the time to be here.
<br><br>

 Thank you, Marcia.

RYAN (BR):  Marcia, I think I&rsquo;m going to employ you as a
consultant to help me improve the quality of my visual presentations.
[Marcia laughs] That was so beautiful! I love those pictures.
