it violated every concept of my whole idea of life and honor and democracy and fairness and decency.  And then I began to realize that the government we think we've got is not the government we have.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I said this publicly to people in conferences.  I said, "You people out there <em>blithely</em> think you live in a democratic republic... well, you don't."  And then what's all come out over the years - the shadow government - we don't know who they are.  We have no idea. We have an <em>inkling</em> of who they might be.</font><img src="bob_dean_5.jpg" width="450" height="372" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But these guys are unelected.  They are not... they are not responsible, they don't have any responsibility to congress, to the people, to the country... to <em>anything</em>.  And they're running the damn program.  And that drives me up the wall!  I could almost <em>kill</em>... my sense of anger is so deep over that...  that these self-appointed so-called experts that are running this program and keeping this...  the greatest story in human history from people.  The people have a right to know.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And let me tell you why I say that.  I shared this with Bill:  I have always believed that if this were to come out - <em>totally</em> - as big as it is, as dynamite as it is, that it would bring about an expansion of consciousness in people.  That we would stop thinking of ourselves as Muslim, Christian, Jew, whatever...  we would think of ourselves as human beings from one little, tiny planet on the edge of a middle-class, mid-sized galaxy.  And that knowledge in itself would bring us together as a species and as a race.  And I thought, "That is our survival."  If we can bring ourselves together and think of ourselves as 'one race, one people,' this knowledge that we're not alone and we've never been alone I think would do that.  (sighs)</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kerry Cassidy:  So... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bob Dean:  But the story is so big, honey.  Let me tell you something else.  Over the years I've learned...  what I learned in 1967 was <em>nothing</em> compared to what I've learned since.  Over the years, digging in, talking to people...  talking to people in high positions...  people who would - you know - sit at a conference and say, "Hey, let's sit down and talk.  Let me tell you what I just learned... "  I've almost come to the conclusion that the story is so damned big that the government may be right:  that the mass of people can't deal with it.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do you tell people that this species, this race that we're all a part of...  is a <em>hybrid</em> race?  That we were genetically created by an extraterrestrial intelligence...  how do you tell them that?  Ha...  carefully!  You look around and you tell them carefully, depending on <em>where you are</em>.  Now if you're in Baghdad, talking to some Sunnis or Shia, you don't even bring the damned subject up.  How do you tell them that every major religion on the planet has been initiated and orchestrated by extraterrestrial intelligence?  How do you tell Christian fundamentalists that that lovely man from Galilee two thousand years ago was a part of that program?  You <em>don't</em> tell them that, unless you've checked the exits and know how the hell you can run and get out of the house!  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  OK, well... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  You don't bring these subjects up.  How do you tell them, for example, that this <em>contact</em> and these abductions is...  the genetic program is still underway?!  That these people that are pulled out of their bedrooms and their automobiles at night, and are examined and samples taken and all...  and it is <em>shocking</em> to them...  and it is <em>frightening</em> to them...  and it's <em>harrowing</em> to them.  When they finally have to confront it, and maybe through hypnotic regression, they have to deal with it...  how do you tell them that that's part of the ongoing genetic development program?  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  But how do you <em>not</em> tell them, when they're in the <em>millions</em>, you know?  When there's <em>so many</em> of them out there, right now, that are <em>just</em> as aware as you are...  and as I am, and Bill...  you know, and Marcia, I mean... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are not in the minority as much as we <em>think</em> we are.  And that's the interesting problem, is that the government and what they've planned to do all those years back when they were running the country (which they're not any more)...  you know, wasn't the best decision they made back then.  And <em>now</em>, it's the worst thing to keep the secret going.  And you <em>obviously</em> believe that it's still important to wake people up.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  I still believe that there are... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Because you're here today.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  ...great masses of people out there who can deal with it.  You didn't fall to the floor sobbing when I just told you that <em>this is a fact</em>.  This is not just my idea...  these are facts that I have verification for.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Okay.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  You see, I <em>know</em> that...  I've talked to people on the inside.  I've had people come and share with me, who are on the inside.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  I bet...  I bet.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  ... And say, "Let me <em>tell</em> you... "  I've had military officers share with me, "I had men working for me," he said.  Over in...  outside of Las Vegas, "that when they were confronted with this, I had grown men with combat experience who broke down and cried like <em>babies</em>."  He says, "They can't deal with it.  I've had to send these men off to another assignment somewhere."  They couldn't deal with it.  They came face-to-face with an alien and broke down and cried like babies.  Now...  you say you can deal with this, right?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Okay, but...  these are people that have all...  have bought into a certain <em>mindset</em> that a lot of people on the outside - and I mean the civilians - never bought into anyway.  I mean it just depends who you're talking to, but you and I know that we're in a world that is...  is changing faster than anyone could even think.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  You're in a world that isn't at all what you think it is.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Exactly.  So...  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  As I have said, many times: you are living at the moment inside of, part of, one of the galaxy's finest, ripest, zoological gardens.  And if you think I just told you you live in a zoo...  you <em>do</em> live in a zoo!  Now, I don't know how this deals with your sense of ego and your self-respect, and who you think of yourself...  you are.  But you are an animal, living in a zoo.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, how does a mass of people, confronted with this reality, going to deal with this?  You're unusually enlightened and bright on this subject, because I think you have informed yourself.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Of course.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  You purposefully made...  tried to learn what it was all about.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  That's right.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  So, you've taken little bits and pieces of this and have absorbed them and digested them, and chewed them and masticated them, little bits and pieces at a time.  So you have a pretty good smart there about what's really happening.  And you're still walking around, like a normal human being!</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Sure.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  But you're an exception.  You know, you're...  I saw an audience filled with people like you when I spoke the last time at my last presentation.  And I was speaking to the...  I was, what do they call it...  singing to the choir?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Yes... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Yeah.  You're part of the choir.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Alright.  But, who is it that's coming to you? I mean, what about Majestic?  You are familiar with the Majestic-12?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Oh, yes.  Yes, yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Well, how... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  They don't call themselves that anymore...  but they exist.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  I understand.  What do they call themselves?  What is their new name?  Do you know it?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Oh, yeah well used to be...  PI-40 was the last term I heard.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  PI-40...  alright.  Well, that's fine, so there's forty... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  I don't know what the hell that means...  there's probably forty members of it now.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  And have they approached you?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  I've met several of them, yeah.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Because they know you're very well informed... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Well let...  can we get back to the subject here, we were talking about just briefly earlier...   why the hell have I gotten away with what I'm doing.  I've got a big mouth, I've come out bluntly and honestly and I've...  shared my anger.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I think...  and I've said this publicly...  after I began speaking all over the world and all over this country, about subjects as sensitive as the ones we've just been talking about...  I concluded there was <em>someone</em>, <em>somewhere</em> who wanted me to do this.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Sure.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  ... or I could not have gotten away with it.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Absolutely.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  And I don't know who that someone is...  I may have met him or her...  They may have been among those who have come up to me at conferences and  shook my hand and said, "Damn good job.  Keep it up," you know, something like that.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Okay, so...   what Dan Burisch says is that part of Majestic wants disclosure, and part of Majestic does not.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Well but...  Twenty years ago they were split down the middle.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Alright.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  We <em>know</em> this... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Right.  So where do you think...  where do you think it's at today?...  Do you think that... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Robert Wood...  do you know who Bob Wood is?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Absolutely.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Okay, you know his son Ryan?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Alright.  Bob Wood said this to me at a conference in Long Beach a long time ago...  he said, "I know two members of Majestic."  He said, "They said they're split down the middle and it's a ferocious damned fight."  He said, "It's vicious."  He says, "One half says 'Yes, bring it out' and the other half says not only 'No' but 'Hell no, and not <em>ever</em>' "  And that group is still calling the shots.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Okay.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  You see, we've got a shadow government thing here...  this is a little bit of interest to me, as an American, and it should be of interest to you... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Absolutely.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Do you know how much money a trillion dollars is?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  No concept, but I hear you.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  It's a <em>lot</em>.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Yeah.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Okay...  In this country, for three years...  '98, '99, and 2000...  each year there was 2.7 trillion dollars missing from the Pentagon accounts that they could not figure out where the money went.  They knew they had it, and then it was <em>gone</em>.  Now that's 2.7 <em>trillion</em> a year for three years.  Now...  you think these guys aren't funded well?!</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  (Laughs)</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Oh, hell, they're funded better than the United States Army, for Christ's sake.  The United States Army doesn't get that kind of...  you know, we get money in the <em>billions</em>, but not in the <em>trillions</em>.  And not 2.7 trillion a year for three years... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Right.  Are you referring to <a href="https://solari.com/about-us/catherine" target="_blank">Catherine Fitts</a>, her research?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Well, I haven't met the lady...  I have a great deal of respect for her... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Sure.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  I have a very close, dear friend, who...  I will tell you this and I will deny I ever said it.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Okay.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  There's a member of PI-40 who runs a think tank in Washington, D.C...

And he told Catherine one time, he says, "You want meet an alien?  I can arrange it... "  And she got...  and she evidently scurried off.  And so, he was never forced to deliver on his promise.  But if you ever are in Washington, and you get a chance, say hello to John for me, will you?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  I will do that.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Okay, I... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  That story is on Catherine's website... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Oh, is it?!</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  She said she always regretted to this day...  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  ... that she never took him up on it?

You know.  "Are they the Lizards, or are they the Reptiles," or are they 'this' or are they 'that'...  it doesn't matter...   we're dealing with some groups out there that...  are a million years ahead of us in evolution, technology, and development.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are intelligent races out there that are a <em>billion</em> years ahead of us.  We found stars out there, that probably have planets, that are three times as old as our star...  meaning that probably the planets and the intelligent life on those planets around those stars maybe three times older...  we've been maybe, what...  11 billion?  Well, that's <em>nothing</em>.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The universe, the last they figured, was 14 billion.  And then they had an astronomer...  I love this...  they had an astronomer one day who said, "We can't figure this out...  we found stars that are older than the universe."  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  (Laughs)</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  ... and I thought, "Nitwit.

And there are cultures, civilizations, societies...  that are a <em>million</em> years ahead of us.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now...  I used...  I like this because it's an exercise I like to throw out to kids.  I put together a curriculum one time for grade school kids, on this subject.

Well, actually, you've shown me a remarkable amount of consciousness, of love, of...  you know, you have a vibrant spirit that's very amazing...  you're very eloquent...  for you this has <em>not</em> been all bad.  This information has enlightened you, and made you who you are today.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  Yeah, it certainly has.  What I am today is a total product of not only 78 years on this planet, but I've always liked to say that you know...  I've lived a...  couple of hundred lifetimes, because I'm totally convinced of the reality of reincarnation...  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Good for you.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  I just made my mind up that I ain't coming back here <em>again</em>.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  (Laughs)</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  The point I'm getting at is, I have a love-hate relationship with the human race...

But what I'm doing here with you and your little camera, is to some degree, doing <em>just that</em>.  If my words have any meaning or any value, to not only to you guys, but to anyone in the future who sees this, it is that I <em>love</em> this race...  (sighs)... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've been a part of it, for 78 years, this time.  I've seen pure hell.

(deep breath)  It's very difficult to talk about.  I've been <em>abducted</em>.  I don't look upon it as an abduction...  I look upon it as an invitation, and...  I've been aboard some of those ships several times.  I've had even friends come up to me and say, "Oh my God...

Yeah, no hypnotic regression needed.  When that...  when that happens to you, it makes such an imprint on you, that you don't need to be hypnotically regressed to remember.  I mean, it's <em>there</em>.  It's like a <em>scar</em> - it's there.  No no, I've been aboard several times, and I suspect much of the information I've got about the depth...  the <em>depth</em> of the societies and the civilizations and the cultures...  that exist out there, that makes me know how <em>glorious</em> some of them are... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then I look around this <em>mud-heap</em> that we're living in here, and I think, knowing what it could be...  and what it's not...  and hopefully, what it <em>might</em> be. (emotional)... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've touched a nerved here...

That's another story.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No, I've shared with you this afternoon a couple of little things.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Well, we're honored.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  <em>Why</em> I feel so strongly that this truth...  that we're not alone, we've never been alone, that we're intimately involved in this inter-relationship.  <em>We are family</em> with them.  And yes, we are 'in a zoo' and they are...  in a degree, to an extent...  our 'zookeepers.'  Now you don't share that with everybody out there.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Old Jerry Falwell, wherever he may be right now, God bless his soul...  No, he's not <em>there</em>, Marcia, there is no such place as that...   she's pointing <em>down</em>.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  (Laughs)</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  No, Hell doesn't exist.

I believe that.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  But, there are people out there that I've...  I spoke in Dallas one time.  That's what they call the Bible Belt.  It's right in the middle of 'Bible Belt,' in Texas, you know.  And I laid some pretty hairy things out there in front of 800 people one afternoon.  And I looked at people's faces and I saw their eyebrows rise and their mouths drop, and...  little old ladies going (gestures with mouth open and hands on face)...  you know.  And after it was all over with, down comes the aisle, here comes this rotund, round little Baptist, fundamentalist minister...  with his Bible under his arm and he's heading for me.  And I thought, "Oh, God, we're going to be rolling on the floor here in a minutes, because I've shared some pretty blunt things to that group over there in the'Bible Belt. "</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well...  got the shock of my life.  This little Baptist minister comes up...  makes...  <em>leaps</em> up onto the stage.  It must have been 250 pounds of...  you know...  comes up on to the stage, throws his arms around me, and as I said, we're going to roll on the floor here, and he's going to beat me half to death with his Bible... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He hugs me, kisses me, and says, "Oh, Brother Dean, you've said it the way it needs to be said."  And I was in a total state of shock.  But that's only happened once.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  (Laughs) That's amazing.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  It...  it was an interesting experience for me.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  That's great.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  But it encouraged me to continue to be outspoken and blunt.  And as I've done...  as I've said, in my last presentation in San Jose, I laid it out pretty bluntly, pretty close to what I shared with you this afternoon, only not entirely.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I don't speak publicly anymore.  I've been invited may times...  I've turned down invitations.  I turned down a trip abroad...  another conference up in Laughlin... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But this is probably my last interview.  And I've given you a lot of...  garbage here.  I've given you a lot of material.  If, within that mass of stuff I've shared, if you can find one or two items that are worth keeping, that's fine.  But as I said, I have a love-hate relationship with the human species, and I just know what we could be and what we're not.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I learned years ago...  before I retired in '76...  the government knew, not only <em>everything</em> the SHAPE study had in '64...  the government knew all of that and more, years and years before.  They just were not sharing it with anybody.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Right.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  We were...  we were confronting and dealing with intelligences from other planets, other star systems, other galaxies...  and some of the contacts we've had have been intelligence from other dimensions.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, I'm all fascinated by the work Michio Kaku, this brilliant scientist in New York, who is a physicist who is involved in string theory... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Yes.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  And I think their latest conclusion is...  that they concluded there are at least 11 different dimensions.  And I've always said that death...  when we die...  the soul, which I believe is an immortal living creature in itself, simply goes over to the next dimension, which we look upon as death.  Well, it isn't death; it's just a higher form of life.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I've been making my plans recently to...  to make the transition.  Marcia says, "Don't get up alone to go tonight."

It's the beginning.  My conclusion is, and I haven't been given, "blah, blah, blah," you know, "this is what's going to happen"... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've concluded that it involves probably major contact.  I mean <em>major</em>.  If you think the Phoenix Lights, which I'm sure you're familiar with... </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Sure.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  You're familiar with the Hudson Valley Incident some years back?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Mm-hm.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  ... Which makes the Phoenix Lights look like nothing...  as I said, small potatoes.  I think that these exposures, these fly-overs, are going to probably gently continue to increase...  and I think in 2012, somehow...  I anticipate, and I hope to hang around maybe that long...  if I can get my arthritis to settle down.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think, major contact.  I think we're going to have it whether we like it...  whether we're ready for it or not.  I think that by that time we will be so close to destroying ourselves with a thermonuclear exchange, that they're going to step into the zoo and...  put the orang-utans over <em>here</em>...  and the baboons over <em>here</em>...  and the chimps over <em>here</em>...  and they're going to say, "Now look:  these are some facts, guys.  Time to wake up, time to grow up."  This is what Robert Heinlein called 'Graduation Day'.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  Has it occurred to you...  I'm not sure if you've heard Dan Burisch's testimony, or seen his interview...  we did an interview with him, in which he talks about the fact that, from what he's been told, some of the aliens that have come to visit were time-traveling humans from the future.  Has this entered into any of your contact experiences, or knowledge that you've come across?</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  No, it's always...  it's been a...  well, how do I say this?  It's been a <em>given</em> to me that time travel is a <em>reality</em>.  Now, I don't know if I've been <em>told</em> that, but I seem to instinctively accept it and understand it.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Time, as we understand it, and this dimensional thing, and the time and space, is so...  so primitive and so fundamental, you know...  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Time is infinite, space is infinite, and time and space is connected so deeply involved together...  that time travel is just accepted...  it's a given.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, this primitive little society here...  still likes to play with the idea, you know, make movies and all that, and tell stories and...  <em>wonder</em>, and...  to <em>me</em>, the fact that some of these <em>dimensional</em> people...  that in <em>itself</em> is form of time travel.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you come here from another dimension...  that is so totally different in many respects than what we have here...  you're literally coming from another time.  Now, whether it's <em>our</em> time, and another time and place...  you see, we are so limited in our concept, physically...  in terms of physics and all, that we really can't even discuss it.  </font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are <em>entering</em> the end of the Great Year.  Now...  our astronomers tell us that we're <em>moving</em>...  this little tiny solar system, and all of its little, pathetic little planets...  even beautiful Jupiter...  we're all moving in a form in the galaxy...  we're on the edge and we're shifting...  and we're reaching a point where we're going to be aligned somehow...  with the center of the galaxy.  Now, don't ask me to explain how that works, but I do know...  I do believe that we are completing a Great Year.  This age of Pisces is closing.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I always felt that the beautiful young man from Galilee was part of that because he ushered it in...  and, eh, I've often wondered if he might now drop back in to usher it out.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I'm not talking religion to you, I'm talking spirituality.  Because that young...  that <em>spirit</em>, that <em>soul</em>, that <em>great soul</em> that incarnated in Galilee back then...  is alive and well, and I've told some of my fundamentalist friends, who think I'm cracked.</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KC:  (laughs)</font></p>    <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BD:  ...
