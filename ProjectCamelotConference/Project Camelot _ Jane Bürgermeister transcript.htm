<font color="#990033"><strong><em>Introduction:</em></strong></font>
<br><br>

BILL
RYAN (BR):  Some people have written to us and they&rsquo;ve said:
<I>Look,
you&rsquo;re not going to have a policeman with a gun knocking on
your door accompanied by a doctor with a syringe. They haven&rsquo;t
got the resources to do that</I><I>.</I>


<br><br>

How,
actually, could they enforce it if they wanted to? How could it
happen? What would be the sanctions which they have?
<br><br>

JANE
BÜRGERMEISTER (JB):  Well, the French government released, or
circulated, to the heads of departments an internal document of 19
pages which outlined quite clearly their method, and this is what I
assume is happening in every country. They&rsquo;re going to set up
vaccine centers that are outside hospitals and GPs [General
Practitioner]. Some of these are going to be secure.

<br><br>

People
are going to be told to go there, first of their own free will, and
then they&rsquo;re going to receive calls, whatever, telling them to
appear at a certain time. Those people who do not come are going to
eventually be collected and forced to go there.
<br><br>

BR:
 Do the resources exist to actually do that? Because you&rsquo;re
talking about transporting, and enforcing, and rounding up, and
making contact with hundreds of thousands of people and possibly many
more than that.
<br><br>

JB:
 Absolutely. If so many people refuse, it will be impossible. But
they are assuming that the vast majority of people will either go of
their free will or, when they get the call from, say, a police
authority, telling them to appear, or a notification, they will go
reluctantly but they will still obey that call.

<br><br>

The
number of people who will actually refuse to go, and stay at home
when they&rsquo;re informed it&rsquo;s a criminal offense not to go,
will be very small. And it will be a criminal offense not to go.

<br><br>

However,
if it turns out that hundreds of thousands and millions refuse to go,
then they cannot carry it through. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s
important for every single person to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and not to
go along with it.
<br><br>

<font color="#990033"><strong><em>Start of Interview:</em></strong></font>
<br><br>

BILL
RYAN (BR):  This is Bill Ryan from Project Camelot. I&rsquo;m here in
Vienna on the 8th of September, 2009. I happen to be in Vienna
because I just returned from a conference in Poland.
<br><br>

I
have just met Jane Bürgermeister who, up until now, has been a figure
shrouded in mystery. [laughs] It&rsquo;s my great pleasure to
introduce you visually to the world here by being the first person in
the Internet community to have made a trail to find out &ndash; and
here I&rsquo;m going to make a joke &ndash; &ldquo;whether you really
exist or not.&rdquo; I can demonstrate to everyone that you truly do.


<br><br>

What,
may I ask, Jane, was your response when you realized that you had an
opportunity, basically, to give a message to the world on camera,
which is what I want to support you in being able to do?
<br><br>

JANE
BURGERMEISTER (JB):  Well, thank you, Bill, for taking the trouble to
come all the way here. It&rsquo;s a bit off the beaten track here in
Vienna. It is, however, a significant place as it turns out. It is
the place where Baxter contaminated
72 kilos of vaccine
material with the live bird flu, and so nearly triggered a global
pandemic just a few months ago in February.

<br><br>

This
attempt to trigger a pandemic failed because of the alertness of
people in the Czech Republic who detected it in a laboratory
bio-test. However, it has
now turned out that Baxter still has at least a large amount of that
72 kilos of bird flu.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
coming to a point where we have only perhaps a few weeks until the
government here in Austria, and other governments around the world,
intend to start injecting people with the so-called swine flu vaccine
material which we have every reason to fear is going to be a big
hazard to our health &ndash; and has been designed to be a hazard to
our health &ndash; even if it isn&rsquo;t contaminated with the live
bird flu virus, as it might well be.

<br><br>

So,
my message that I want to give to people, if I can give any message,
is that time is running short, that we, all of us, now have to
recognize the scale of the threat and danger to us individually and
collectively, and we need to take steps and organize to stop this
mass vaccination program as soon as possible.
<br><br>

BR:
 As we were discussing, when we were just chatting before we started
this video interview, you feel a tremendous sense of urgency, don&rsquo;t
you? This is driving you right now.
<br><br>

JB:
 Well, unfortunately, we have seen how, in spite of mounting and
growing protests in the USA and now in Europe, the latest polls show
that 29 percent of the Germans are categorically going to refuse the
swine flu vaccine.

<br><br>

In
spite of all that, the governments are pressing ahead relentlessly.
WHO is pushing, with tremendous determination, this unwanted,
unnecessary and dangerous program on us and it&rsquo;s coming in just
a few weeks.
<br><br>

BR:
 What&rsquo;s interesting to me is that we, like you, get reports
from all over the world and it seems that governments in every
first-world nation, and maybe other nations too, seem to be
preparing, almost like marching in step with this thing. This is
coordinated, isn&rsquo;t it?
<br><br>

JV:
 Absolutely. And if you look at the legal framework, they are all
following the same legal framework. It&rsquo;s the International
Health Regulations of 2005 which gives WHO, the World Health
Organization based in Geneva, the power to control how governments
respond to this pandemic &ndash; which WHO has itself declared.

<br><br>

Every
country has a more or less identical Pandemic Plan which hands power
over to the World Health Organization, which allows the World Health
Organization to take over the police and health forces. Every country
will set up a Crisis Committee which will determine what vaccine
centers are established, what groups are going to be targeted for
vaccination, and so on.

<br><br>

That
is the reason why it&rsquo;s so coordinated and synchronized, because
there is a single body behind it, and this is the World Health
Organization, the UN, and the people who back that: the banking
cartel and family dynasties, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
<br><br>

BR:
 Now, let&rsquo;s just back up a moment here and, for those people
watching this video who don&rsquo;t know who you are and why we
should be talking here in Vienna, can you just give a little bit of
your background, the things that you shared with me personally?

<br><br>

For
instance, I didn&rsquo;t even know that you were at the University of
Edinburgh, how long you&rsquo;ve been in Vienna, what you&rsquo;re
doing here, and just a little bit of a bio. How did you get to this
place? Sometimes you must wake up in the morning asking yourself the
same question. [laughs] How did you get here?

<br><br>

JB:
 Well, my dad is Austrian and my mother is from Ireland and I was
born in Switzerland. I went to Edinburgh University where I did
English literature and language and a bit of philosophy and so on.

<br><br>

I
came to Austria in the year 2000. I started working here as an editor
for a medical journal specializing in diabetes. I quit that of my own
free will and started writing for medical wires: <I>Reuters
Health</I>, for the <I>British
Medical Journal</I>, <I>The
Scientist</I>, <I>Nature</I>,
and so on, so I acquired an understanding of the medical field and
how to do research in this area.

<br><br>

Then,
I eventually moved into renewable energy because I believe that&rsquo;s
a tremendous potential for humanity, until one day this winter a
neighbor showed me the report in a local newspaper saying that Baxter
had contaminated this vaccine material and 36 people had to go to
hospital to be treated preventatively for the bird flu.

<br><br>

Then,
of course, I understood this is a tremendous threat, and that because
Biosafety Level 3 regulations are in place in these sorts
of facilities,
it can&rsquo;t have
been an accident.
<br><br>

BR:
 So, your experience gained as a medical journalist immediately
helped you to realize that something very unusual and important had
happened here. Is that right?
<br><br>

JB:
 Absolutely. Absolutely. I also felt competent about doing the
research into it and filing charges, which I did eventually. Because
of that background, I had done quite a lot of work in that field, so
I felt competent I could handle it.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. Now, something which I do want to ask you is that many people
have understandably asked the question: <I>Who
is this woman and where has she come from out of nowhere?</I>
And I can resonate with that because people say that about us and
people feel sometimes an understandable sense of territoriality. It&rsquo;s
like: <I>Wait a minute, this
is my area.</I> Or: <I>Wait
a minute, I&rsquo;ve been researching this for 20 years. Where does
this newcomer come from?</I>
<br><br>

Now,
were you conscious of the fact that when you started to write about
this stuff, people would be saying: <I>Who
is this person? We never heard her name before.</I>
<br><br>

JB:
 I have to be honest and say my concern was to try and stop, and
publicize, what I saw as a big crime and threat. I was very concerned
that there was no publicity, no action being taking by the Austrian
government, and that Baxter could release this material the day
after.
<br><br>

BR:
 And it should have been news headlines all over the world.
<br><br>

JB:
 Absolutely.

<br><br>

BR:
 It was underwhelming, wasn&rsquo;t it?
<br><br>

JB:
 It was underwhelming and that created the risk that they were just
going to repeat the same maneuver and a pandemic was going to be
ignited.

<br><br>

Because
I, myself, had come to realize that the media was totally controlled,
through my own experiences working in the media, I didn&rsquo;t make
too much effort in trying to alert the newspapers. I sent the story,
or the pitch, to <I>BMJ</I>.
The editor wasn&rsquo;t interested. I wasn&rsquo;t too surprised.
<br><br>

BR:
 That&rsquo;s the <I>British
Medical Journal.</I>
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes, for which I have worked. <I>The
Lancet</I> wasn&rsquo;t
interested. I sent it to the Austrian papers; no response. <I>Profil</I>,
an Austrian magazine,
actually wrote an article whitewashing Baxter, in spite of all my
information.

<br><br>

As
an individual, I saw very few opportunities for halting this
mechanism, or <I>truck</I>
that seemed to be hurtling towards unleashing a pandemic. So I filed
criminal charges in the hope of putting a spoke in the wheel and
forcing an investigation. I&rsquo;d never done that before and...

<br><br>

BR:
 Did you have professional help in doing that? Because I wouldn&rsquo;t
know how to start filing changes against anybody.
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes, to be honest, a lawyer did tell me I had to file criminal
charges and where to go and what were the basic laws, so I did get
that advice.
<br><br>

On
my mother&rsquo;s side of the family, there were some lawyers, so my
mum, too, was very good at kind of legal reasoning and stuff like
that, so I decided to give it a shot. I&rsquo;d never done it before,
but I thought I might as well give it a try.

<br><br>

The
evidence was there. It was just a question of laying it out clearly,
so that&rsquo;s what I did and the police did start investigating.
<br><br>

BR:
 This is the police here in Vienna, right?
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes. Yes. My understanding is that three police forces are
investigating: the police in Vienna, the police in
Korneuburg
and the Unit for
Protection of the Constitution and Fighting Terrorism was also
investigating &ndash; I know that for sure, because I was summoned
there for an interview.

<br><br>

However,
what has alarmed me is the fact that nothing has happened. The
government is continuing to press ahead with its program of mass
vaccination with these Baxter vaccines. There are no security checks
in place to ensure that the material isn&rsquo;t contaminated. The
situation is such that I might as well never have filed the charges.

<br><br>

Last
week, the head of the Unit for Protecting the Constitution and
Fighting Terrorism was forced to resign, it seems, and replaced by
somebody who appears to be much more loyal to the powers that want
this vaccination program to go ahead. The same is true of the
Austrian Criminal Police &ndash; the head was replaced by somebody
who also has a track record of working for these so-called New World
Order corporations.

<br><br>

So,
I increasingly feel these structures in government are not going to
be effective in stopping and halting this danger and that&rsquo;s why
we have to now move towards organized civilian resistance to the
vaccines.
<br><br>

BR:
 But, you must be encouraged because parallel with your
metaphorically waking up that morning to realize: <I>Wait
a minute, what&rsquo;s wrong with this picture? There&rsquo;s
something happening that shouldn&rsquo;t be,</I>
a lot of other people all over the world have been becoming very
aware of this and very active. You must be feeling heartened by that,
yeah?
<br><br>

JB:
 Absolutely. I mean, the response has been amazing and exponential.
Every day it&rsquo;s amazing to see the progress.

<br><br>

Today
I heard that the Greek police are going to refuse, and have
officially refused, to take the vaccine &ndash; which is quite a
significant milestone. This is the police force which the government
will rely on to force the Greeks to take a vaccine. According to
polls, the Greeks do not want to take the vaccine, so eventually, it
will come down to the government having to either force them, or try
and frighten them, into taking it by tricking
a pandemic.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
just one example. In Germany, there is enormous resistance and so is
there in France, not to mention the USA, and increasingly, in the UK.


<br><br>

Unfortunately
my language skills are limited. I don&rsquo;t speak Spanish, or any
other language, so I&rsquo;m only able to track, [and] am on to,
what&rsquo;s happening in the countries where I speak a bit of the
language, which is France, Germany, and the English-speaking
countries.
<br><br>

BR:
 I just came back from Poland, where I gave a talk about a whole
bunch of stuff, including this, to a large number of very awake and
aware and concerned people. I was heartened because, maybe like
yourself, I didn&rsquo;t know anything about what was happening in
Poland.

<br><br>

People
are very, very concerned. They&rsquo;re very aware that there&rsquo;s
a problem here. It&rsquo;s being discussed a lot, and just now, I
showed you a document that had been prepared by a very highly
respected Polish medic saying that this is completely out of order,
it shouldn&rsquo;t be happening, the vaccines are likely to be
contaminated, [and] the whole thing is spurious.

<br><br>

There&rsquo;s
evidence that this wave is sort of growing all over the world and
some of this has been caused by your own civilian initiative.

<br><br>

Now,
just to back up a little bit, somewhere down the line, and this may
seem like quite a long time ago now, you lost your job &ndash;
probably because of this &ndash; didn&rsquo;t you?
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes I did. To be honest, I can&rsquo;t even remember now when it
was, but I think it was at the end of June, or the beginning of July,
I was unceremoniously informed that the reports that I had been
scheduled to write were not required. Since I had been working there
for almost two years without any complaint, and no reason was given,
it was clear to me that this was connected with the fact that I had
filed these criminal charges.

<br><br>

I
also went to the US embassy in Vienna and filed charges with the FBI.
In part, it was a symbolic gesture because the reputation of the FBI
is, perhaps, not the greatest.
<br><br>

BR:
 Those charges that you filed, was it <I>with</I>
the FBI or <I>against</I>
the FBI?
<br><br>

JB:
 With the FBI.
<br><br>

BR:
 So, basically asking the FBI to investigate.
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes.
<br><br>

BR:
 And you filed them at the American embassy here in Vienna?
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. Now, some people in America have tried to follow the paper
trail and said that they couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence that these
charges had been filed. It is possible that they never left whatever
room it was which you filed them in, in the American embassy?
<br><br>

JB:
 Not really, because I even sent copies by email to, actually,
various FBI departments, because I&rsquo;m well aware, in the
meantime, that there are within every police structure, these people
who are obstructing investigations.

<br><br>

So,
my aim was not just to file them physically here in the US embassy,
but also to spread the word around other FBI departments throughout
the USA and I think I sent them to about ten or twelve.

<br><br>

BR:
 Okay.
<br><br>

JB:
 I was also assured by an agent working at the US embassy that she
had sent the physical charges that I had filed in the official post,
or whatever, to their Washington headquarters, so that was an
assurance I received.
<br><br>

BR:
 You must have reference numbers and records or some kind of receipt
or copy.
<br><br>

JB:
 No.
<br><br>

BR:
 No?
<br><br>

JB:
 I'll be honest. The FBI has not contacted me. I rang them and they
informed me that I would not necessarily get contact from them.

<br><br>

The
situation is the scale of my charges was monumental in the sense that
it kind of more or less alleges that the US government,
pharmaceutical companies and banking cartels are operating together
to push forward this mass-murder program under the guise of offering
people vaccinations.

<br><br>

So,
I mean, I would have been amazed if they&rsquo;d handled it as a
regular kind of complaint, you know, given it a file number and all
the rest of it. It took a while for the Austrian police to assign a
case number to my case, too.
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. The reason behind my question there was there are some people
who've tried to follow that trail and they&rsquo;ve said that they
cannot find any evidence &ndash; in the American system that they&rsquo;ve
tried to find these things in &ndash; that these charges have been
filed. I just wondered whether there&rsquo;s any answer that you can
give to that in terms of a reference number: this is where to look,
this is what it says.

<br><br>

JB:
 No, I can&rsquo;t do anything.
<br><br>

BR:
 Nothing like that?
<br><br>

JB:
 I filed them. I have the evidence that I sent them to the FBI. I
have the emails.

<br><br>

What
the FBI did, unfortunately, is outside my control. If they haven&rsquo;t
registered it, if they haven&rsquo;t assigned it a case number, if
they haven&rsquo;t recorded it, as it is their duty and requirement
to do so, that&rsquo;s their problem and I&rsquo;m not responsible
for their lapses.
<br><br>

BR:
 Sure.
<br><br>

JB:
 And that&rsquo;s it. Anybody who wants the emails proving that I
also emailed the FBI is very welcome to have them. I mean, I think
they&rsquo;re even up on the web somewhere, so...
<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. To some extent, what you did was almost like a symbolic act,
as well as actually initiating charges, which actually... I mean is
not the kind of thing that most people usually take it upon
themselves to do. So, it was quite a valiant David-and-Goliath action
there. But, it was symbolic and it was encouraging to a lot of
people. Do you feel that people have responded to it in that way?
<br><br>

JB:
 Well, I think there&rsquo;s been, as you pointed out, a growing
recognition that this really is a threat and there&rsquo;s solid
evidence that this is a threat.

<br><br>

This
is something that I tried to lay out in the charges, to explain the
empirical evidence for my views, so people can read through it and
see why I&rsquo;ve reached these conclusions; so can the FBI agents,
so can the police, and so on.

<br><br>

On
the other hand, there&rsquo;s no denying that these structures are
extremely corrupt, and if no investigation is initiated, no case file
numbers are assigned, it becomes increasingly clear over time that we
the people cannot rely on these so-called police and law-enforcement
branches to do their job and protect us against a threat.

<br><br>

This
is what&rsquo;s becoming increasingly clear is that they&rsquo;re not
doing their job; that the evidence is handed to them, they&rsquo;re
not arresting the people they should be arresting, they&rsquo;re not
stopping the whole infrastructure for this mass vaccination program,
in spite of the dangers.

<br><br>

So,
at this point, people are realizing that the justice system and the
law enforcement system has nothing more to do with justice and law
enforcement and this needs to be rebuilt and reconstituted. Indeed,
our entire societies need to be reconstituted on the basis of law and
order, justice, the Constitution, if we are to have any hope of a
future.
<br><br>

BR:
 Just before we went on camera here, we were talking a little bit
about the UFO phenomenon, which is something that you don&rsquo;t
even pretend to know anything about and there&rsquo;s no reason why
you should &ndash; it&rsquo;s a different area. You asked me whether
I believed in that kind of information, and of course, the answer is
that we do -- because we&rsquo;ve extensively researched it.

<br><br>

But
there are power levels here that -- whichever line of investigation
one follows in these alternative areas, whether it&rsquo;s
alternative health, cancer cures, free energy, the suppression of all
kinds of information of government activities that have been taking
place for longer than even I&rsquo;ve been here -- you find that
there is obstruction in the organization of our governments, and our
militaries, and our intelligence services.

<br><br>

You&rsquo;ll
find that the citizens, if you try to ask questions, you just don&rsquo;t
get anywhere. You have to be very dogged, and then there are all
kinds of psychological operations that are mounted against anyone who
dares to stand up against Goliath in the way that you have done.

<br><br>

JB:
 That&rsquo;s certainly true. I was aware of my working within the
mainstream media that it is systematically controlled by a central
group who have economic interests with oil or renewable energy, or
suppressing renewable energy.

<br><br>

But,
what was new to me was the insight into the extent which the
alternative media also seems to be controlled. When I tried to do
what I could do, which was file these charges, publicize these
charges, I found myself attacked and accused of not having filed the
charges, of not existing, of all kinds of lies, and the people who
did it... I knew they were lying, because they had the emails in
their possession which showed that I&rsquo;d filed. At least at the
FBI, I&rsquo;d done my bit. I can&rsquo;t be responsible for what the
FBI does.

<br><br>

So,
it became clear to me then that these people were actually trying to
obstruct justice and obstruct the discovery and action against this
program and that they probably had been put in the alternative media
long ago to direct peoples&rsquo; attention away from the
legislation, which allows mass false vaccination programs.

<br><br>

Most
people I&rsquo;ve spoken to have never heard of it. They have no idea
about the International Health Regulations and about the National
Pandemic Plans that allow this.

<br><br>

Somebody
I know even wrote to the Austrian Health Ministry recently and
inquired about this and was told by, I think, a lawyer or a senior
official that there was no way Austrians can be forced to take this
vaccination.

<br><br>

But,
this official obviously hasn&rsquo;t read the National Pandemic Plan
and doesn&rsquo;t know about the International Health Regulations,
which make it absolutely crystal clear that Austrians, in the event
of a pandemic level 6 emergency declaration, actually have to follow
the orders of the World Health Organization, and the World Health
Organization, [both of whom] <I>can</I>
force people to take vaccinations and also to go into quarantine.

<br><br>

So,
the extent of the ignorance of people about this vital legislation
has astonished me. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t know about it, until I did
the research and you would have thought that the alternative media
would have been telling people about this for years, and informing
them about this danger. But it seems they haven&rsquo;t been. There&rsquo;s
a big, big knowledge gap here that has to be filled.

<br><br>

BR:
 There&rsquo;re a lot of items on the
interest and agenda list of the alternative
media, and to some degree, like any media, they react to what the big
story is right now. But, they <I>have</I>
reacted and there is a groundswell of awareness and understanding,
which does seem to be reaching places that it hadn&rsquo;t reached a
little while before, so something&rsquo;s definitely moving here,
isn&rsquo;t it?
<br><br>

JB:
 Absolutely. The way I see it, in spite of the obstacles, in spite of
all these obstructions, the word has got out with phenomenal,
unbelievable speed, which I would never have believed was possible in
a million years. It&rsquo;s just been a miraculous kind of almost
inexplicable form of communication, to my mind, which is taking
place, you know.
<br><br>

BR:
 If you see this as a game &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t use that word in
a trivial sense &ndash; if you see this as a game, how is the game
set up now? What do you think the moves in the game are likely to be?


<br><br>

Are
the citizens of the world starting to wake up more than was
anticipated? What&rsquo;s likely to be the response? Can you think
the way that &ldquo;they&rdquo; &ndash; whoever &ldquo;they&rdquo;
[are] &ndash; how are they thinking? And what might they do?

<br><br>

JB:
 Well, I believe that the speed of the awakening has taken these
people by surprise and it&rsquo;s making them extremely nervous and
worried. They have put in place this plan for the collapse of the
economy in parallel or synchronization with this mass vaccination
program, which is designed to kill or injure a large number of
people.

<br><br>

Then
I think they have plans for famines and wars and various other
things, and for moving countries under the control of the World
Health Organization and the UN which, indeed, will be the result of
this pandemic... declaration of One World Government.

<br><br>

I
don&rsquo;t believe that they are very flexible and can see any way
to back down now, so I think they&rsquo;re pressing ahead. They&rsquo;re
even accelerating their efforts to get this vaccine into the
population by stealth and secrecy.

<br><br>

I
think they&rsquo;re going to try and trigger a pandemic by whatever
means they can in the next few days, weeks. They&rsquo;re going to be
putting it out in schools, as well as injecting it into people. There
was an incident in a Swiss train where vials of so-called swine flu
that was supposed to be being transported to the National Flu Center
exploded on a Swiss train.
<br><br>

BR:
 Was that avian flu or swine flu?
<br><br>

JB:
 Swine flu. That was swine flu, back in April, so we have some
glimpses of the methods that they&rsquo;re willing to use to spread
disease &ndash; very, very curious incident why it was being
transported on a train at all. And by accelerating this pandemic, by
making it ever more virulent, they hope to panic people into taking
the vaccine, which will make it truly disastrous and justify false
mass vaccinations.

<br><br>

I
think they hope that the hierarchical structures in the habit of
obedience will be sufficient, in the panic and confusion that ensues,
to see them through this. That&rsquo;s what I think they hope and
believe.
<br><br>

BR:
 <I>The habit of obedience</I>.
I love that term.
<br><br>

JB:
 Unfortunately, we -- all of us -- have to examine ourselves at this
point and ask how far have we internalized a habit of deference and
obedience that is really not justified, and needs to be... We need to
regain our sense of our own judgments and reliance on our own
judgments and our willingness to stand up against patently corrupt
and criminal authorities and refuse to go along with it.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
why I&rsquo;m now thinking that what we need is actually a kind of
organized, peaceful revolution, so that we can finally take back our
governments, restore our legal systems and our constitutions, and
rebuild our economies, our health systems and our education systems
-- and put these people who are responsible for this in jail, once
and for all, so they cannot continue doing this damage to us.

<br><br>

Even
here in Austria, I think word is spreading and people are going to
refuse. It will be interesting to see how it works out. I mean, my
hope would be that the movement reaches the point where the
nonviolent refusals will be more than enough to destroy and shatter
this plan.
<br><br>

BR:
 Some people have written to us and they&rsquo;ve said: <I>Look,
you&rsquo;re not going to have a policeman with a gun knocking on
your door, accompanied by a doctor with a syringe.</I>
<I>They haven&rsquo;t got the
resources to do that.</I>
How, actually, could they enforce it if they wanted to? How could it
happen? What would be the sanctions which they have?
<br><br>

JB:
 Well, the French government released, or circulated, to the heads of
departments an internal document of 19 pages which outlined quite
clearly their method, and this is what I assume is happening in every
country.

<br><br>

They&rsquo;re
going to set up vaccine centers that are outside hospitals and GPs
[General Practitioners]. Some of these are going to be secure. People
are going to be told to go there, first of their own free will, and
then they&rsquo;re going to receive calls, or whatever, telling them
to appear at a certain time, and those people who do not come are
going to eventually be collected and forced to go there.

<br><br>

BR:
 Do the resources exist to actually do that? You&rsquo;re talking
about transporting and enforcing, and rounding up, and making contact
with hundreds of thousands of people and possibly many more than
that.
<br><br>

JB:
 Well, initially, if so many people refuse, it will be impossible.
But, if they are assuming that the vast majority of people will
either go of their free will, or when they get the call from, say, a
police authority, telling them to appear, or a notification, they
will go reluctantly, but they will still obey that call. The number
of people who will actually refuse to go and stay at home when
they&rsquo;re informed it&rsquo;s a criminal offense not to go, will
be very small. And it will be a criminal offense not to go.

<br><br>

They&rsquo;re
assuming that the vast majority of people, when they get a call out
of the blue, as it&rsquo;s planned in Switzerland, that the police go
through the registry of people who live in the canton, ring them up
and tell them to go to the vaccine center, that most will do it, and
that there will be actually very few that need to be collected by the
police.

<br><br>

I
think they have special pandemic police task forces there; they won&rsquo;t
be counting too much on the regular police to do this. And they&rsquo;re
anticipating, I think, that they can go around and collect those
people.

<br><br>

However,
if it turns out that hundreds of thousands and millions refuse to go,
then they cannot carry it through. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s
important for every single person to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and not to
go along with it.
<br><br>

BR:
 So, it&rsquo;s a propaganda war, or a propaganda game.
<br><br>

JB:
 Absolutely. They don&rsquo;t have the resources. They&rsquo;re
relying on people going of their free will to go to these vaccine
centers. Then they&rsquo;re relying on just being able to make a call
to people telling them it&rsquo;s a criminal offense not to go,
putting psychological pressure on people to go. Then they&rsquo;re
relying on a very relatively small number of people actually saying:<I>
No, I&rsquo;m staying in my home. I&rsquo;m not going on any account,</I>
and waiting for the police to knock on the door and drag them off. At
that point, they will have sufficient forces, if few people do it, to
actually go around and collect people from their homes.
<br><br>

BR:
 Now, fear and concern for one&rsquo;s personal safety is a great
motivator. Are you expecting, just as in 1918, that there&rsquo;s
going to be a second wave of the existing swine flu in a mutated form
which really <I>is</I>
a problem, accompanied by very alarmist media reports showing people
dying and funerals and all of this kind of stuff, that&rsquo;s going
to scare people into lining up for their voluntary vaccinations?
<br><br>

JB:
 Absolutely. It&rsquo;s already happening. I think the scientists in
Canada have looked at people who&rsquo;ve died from the so-called
swine flu and they found that those people have the damage to their
lungs, which is consistent with them having got the bird flu.

<br><br>

And
so, how is it explicable? I mean, they must have been given the bird
flu. So, they&rsquo;ve been getting it from somewhere and it could
have been from the kind of contamination of vaccine material that
occurred here in Austria, where normal vaccine material was
contaminated with the bird flu.

<br><br>

So,
they&rsquo;re already starting, and trying to trigger this really
virulent pandemic. The CDC and WHO have stopped counting or tracking
these cases, so we could be seeing the multiplication of these
virulent cases already now in the USA and Canada.

<br><br>

At
some point the media will focus on it. They will focus on the
terrible deaths of these people from holes in their lungs and
whatever, and this moved
[unclear] panic when vaccine
centers are opened.

<br><br>

People
will be saying: <I>Oh, those
people who were saying it was the vaccine have got it all wrong. They
were lying to us. It&rsquo;s actually the virus that&rsquo;s the real
danger.</I> People in this
fear and confused state of mind will think, maybe, it was all lies
about the vaccine and they&rsquo;ll rush off and get their vaccine
which will then kill them and create an even more virulent virus.
<br><br>

BR:
 Yeah. Something which I realized just a short while ago was that, in
order to really introduce something dangerous to large numbers of the
population, they don&rsquo;t have to vaccinate everybody. Just to
illustrate the point: if I don&rsquo;t get vaccinated, but you do and
so does your friend and then we all meet for dinner to talk about it,
and I say: <I>Well, I&rsquo;m
all right, I haven&rsquo;t been vaccinated</I>
-- there&rsquo;s something now cooking in your bodies that I&rsquo;m
going to catch simply because we shook hands over dinner.
<br><br>

JB:
 Absolutely.
<br><br>

BR:
 So, they don&rsquo;t have to get everyone, right?
<br><br>

JB:
 No. I mean, I think that they would also like to use the opportunity
to put in people these nanochips. There&rsquo;s mounting evidence
that Baxter, and so on, is planning to put into its swine flu vaccine
these nanochips. And certainly WHO has put in place the legal
framework and the technical framework to vaccinate everybody. So, I
think they really are aiming for maximum possible coverage.

<br><br>

But
to kill people, they don&rsquo;t need to vaccinate everyone. They
just need to vaccinate enough people to unleash this really virulent
pandemic.

<br><br>

Eventually
people will just put on their face masks or use their colloidal
silver. Sensible people will already be thinking of taking these
measures. If there&rsquo;s any threat of a virus, they&rsquo;ll be
having their face masks on and boosting their immune systems with
vitamin C and...
<br><br>

BR:
 And D3, I believe.
<br><br>

JB:
 D3. And so, to try and reduce the number of people who survive by
taking these measures, I think they would like to get as many
vaccinated as possible, because this will mean the disease goes
straight in your bloodstream and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do,
basically, once it&rsquo;s there.

<br><br>

BR:
 Okay. So, what you&rsquo;re flagging up here is that there are two
scenarios going on here. This all sounds very black and stark, but
there&rsquo;s the genocide scenario and there&rsquo;s the total
control scenario, and they can go hand-in-hand with each other.
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes. I believe that&rsquo;s the plan. The WHO has, I understand, put
in places a comprehensive electronic surveillance system already. And
as soon as we get our nanochips with all the information about our
health and the health insurance associations and whatever, they&rsquo;ll
be able to track us by satellite and computers, whatever they have,
for the rest of our lives, even if we survive the pandemic, the
vaccination, the wars, the famines, and so on.

<br><br>

So,
in this way, they will have managed to not only establish a One World
Government, but also a technical structure to control every single
one of us on the planet.
<br><br>

BR:
 We&rsquo;ve had it told us by a number of insiders on and off record
that this whole structure just exists already. They&rsquo;ve got the
databases. They&rsquo;ve got a lot of information on most people.
They&rsquo;re doing all this for a reason. This is like the final
match that&rsquo;s lit to the fire, if you like.

<br><br>

So,
my question to you then is, based on what you know -- because you
must also have people writing to you, presumably confidentially,
offering information.
<br><br>

JB:
 I&rsquo;ve had a few private, confidential emails from people who&rsquo;ve
been saying they agree with what I&rsquo;m saying, with the
bioterrorism charges, but because of their positions, they&rsquo;re
not able to come out and say that openly, and obviously, I don't
publish that kind of thing either.

<br><br>

But,
I&rsquo;m not a goldmine of secret information. The thing is: it&rsquo;s
all out there. It&rsquo;s all out there if you just read the Pandemic
Plans, if you read the International Health Regulations, and so on.

<br><br>

The
reason why people are mystified is because the mainstream media
consistently deflects attention from these crucial facts or puts a
spin on them, which misleads people about what their nature... like
this pandemic is natural and caused by pigs -- when it&rsquo;s <I>never</I>
been found in pigs.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
not new, the swine flu. According to the <I>New
England Journal of Medicine</I>,
there&rsquo;s an article documenting cases of it in people since
2005, 2009. It wasn&rsquo;t spreading. It wasn&rsquo;t lethal, you
know.

<br><br>

So,
the mainstream media is what&rsquo;re really mystifying, misleading
people. All I&rsquo;m doing is looking at the facts behind the media
and bringing them together into relationships, so that people can see
the bigger pattern. That&rsquo;s it.
<br><br>

BR:
 What&rsquo;s the time scale, do you think, from here? This is the
eighth of September and we&rsquo;ll get this out in the next few
days, if we possibly can do because time is of the essence. What do
you think is going to happen as we roll on towards the New Year?
<br><br>

JB:
 Well, I think these few weeks are crucial to humanity. I believe all
the plans are in place to start these vaccination centers from
October, and indeed, people are going to be offered time off work &ndash;
in cities like Boston, two hours, I think, unpaid leave to go and get
their swine flu jab. Kids are going to be offered it free.
<br><br>

So,
everything is going to be done at first to persuade people to take
this vaccine. And already we have to stop that! We have to make sure
the protest is significantly large that these vaccine centers do not
start injecting children, the gullible, the uninformed, whatever,
with disease which can then be transmitted to other children sitting
in schools, to their parents, and then to their colleagues at work.
<br><br>

BR:
 That&rsquo;s a perfect place to spread it all: <I>in
schools</I>, isn&rsquo;t it?


<br><br>

JB:
 Absolutely. Unfortunately, the army is another place. The soldiers
are very vulnerable. They seem to be the first ones involved to get
these mass forced vaccinations.

<br><br>

So,
we don&rsquo;t have a minute to lose. It&rsquo;s going to be too late
when the call finally comes through, the
forced
vaccinations [and] demands come through &ndash; barring a miracle.


<br><br>

So
far, they haven&rsquo;t managed to spark the virulent pandemic they
hoped to. In April, I think they really hoped that they had set free
a virus that was going to mutate and become very virulent, and they
didn&rsquo;t manage it. And maybe they won&rsquo;t manage it this
time either, but the more people they vaccinate, the greater the
chances are that they really will spark a lethal pandemic.

<br><br>

Bear
in mind, Baxter sent two kilos of live bird flu virus. It&rsquo;s
still in the company&rsquo;s possession. It could be put into the
vaccines here and if every Austrian or every third or second Austrian
gets it, it spreads rapidly to Germany, to the Czech Republic, to
Slovenia, to Poland, and it will kill many, many people.

<br><br>

BR:
 Well, it spreads almost instantly nowadays, in these days of modern
travel. I mean, in 1918, people were traveling by steamships, and
this is rather different now.
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes, and particularly the schools and the workplaces and so on. I
think we don&rsquo;t have that much time. I think they are reckoning
with being able to move towards forced vaccinations towards the end
of the year; maybe kind of gradually from November, December [and]
January. But, I think we have to stop even the voluntary mass
vaccinations starting from October.
<br><br>

BR:
 So, what&rsquo;s your message to people here? Because some people
will be watching this thinking: <I>Right,
I&rsquo;m going to get my colloidal silver and everything else and
I&rsquo;m not going to get vaccinated and thanks for the information.</I>
But is that enough?

<br><br>

JB:
 Well, I personally believe it isn&rsquo;t because we&rsquo;re in a
situation here where, even if you have your colloidal silver and your
face mask, your neighbor might get vaccinated or you might be in
contact with somebody at work.

<br><br>

So,
it&rsquo;s in the interest of everybody to try and stick together and
do things like protest outside vaccine centers, protest to make sure
schools stay closed. There&rsquo;s no reason to keep them open. Or if
kids have to go to these schools, they should be given face masks and
other sensible measures to protect them in school from these viruses.


<br><br>

So,
I believe that we should all be looking out for each other because,
ultimately, we&rsquo;re looking out for our own interests when we
stop this pandemic from being ignited and gathering speed.

<br><br>

However,
if all you&rsquo;re willing to do is take the colloidal silver and a
face mask -- fine, as long as you&rsquo;re willing, then, when the
order comes for you to take it or to go to quarantine, to resist at
that point or be faced with being imprisoned or whatever. At that
point, I would suggest it&rsquo;s getting a little bit late.
<br><br>

BR:
 How much support are you getting personally? How do you feel?
Because you&rsquo;re like a lonely soldier here fighting this in
Austria, sort of unconnected, at least physically, with the rest of
the world -- what it is that sustains you and keeps you going and
gives you the strength to keep on fighting? Because it&rsquo;s not
easy, is it?
<br><br>

JB:
 Well, I have to say I look at the evidence and I see that there is a
real threat also to me. I mean, I am also going to be one of the
people who could be infected by this pandemic virus, who could be
forced to take this vaccination.  I&rsquo;m stamped a criminal if I
don&rsquo;t take it and this is not a very palatable kind of
prospect.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
not exactly how I want to spend my time, either sick or prematurely
dead from something like this. So, I&rsquo;m motivated also by
self-interest, [laughs] as well as the desire to see other people, of
course, freed from this threat.
<br><br>

BR:
 Do you have a team who are working with you? Do you feel supported
logistically, emotionally, financially? Or is it just really that
you&rsquo;re just standing alone here in Vienna?
<br><br>

JB:
 Oh, no. I mean, I have<B>
</B>Johann Michelson
[spelling uncertain] in
Switzerland has volunteered to put up my website.
<br><br>

BR:
 I met him the other day. He&rsquo;s a wonderful man.
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes. And he&rsquo;s done great work and put up a wonderful website.
And a lot of people
support and send
emails and reports and information that I put up on my website and so
on [ <A HREF="https://www.theflucase.com/" target="_blank">https://www.theflucase.com/</A>
]. Here in Austria, there&rsquo;s somebody who has an email database
of 140,000 emails who&rsquo;s starting to send out information, so
even the Austrians are getting to hear what&rsquo;s happening. So, I
certainly feel not <I>alone</I>.


<br><br>

However,
there&rsquo;s no doubt about it that I, for example, have very little
financial resources and I more or less have to try and scrape by and
this limits how effective I can be. I can&rsquo;t cover countries
outside of Europe or try and launch the kind of legal action that I
would have wished to launch, the injunctions.

<br><br>

In
cases like Africa or Latin America, no substantial funding has come
from any source whatsoever to help in this battle. So it&rsquo;s been
individuals sending relatively small sums of money or offering to do
things like a DVD or whatever, that has, nevertheless, been very,
very important.
<br><br>

BR:
 And you&rsquo;re personally contactable. If there&rsquo;s anyone
watching this now who&rsquo;s able to offer material support, in a
position to do that, they can reach you through your website, right?
<br><br>

JB:
 Yes. They can just find my email address. I&rsquo;m certainly very
visible, I think, for anybody who wants to actually contact me. But
so far, there has been no foundation or wealthy person or anything
like that who has offered support.

<br><br>

And,
I&rsquo;m not even saying they need to offer <I>me</I>
personal support, but there&rsquo;s been no major support for any
injunctions, or any kind of these legal actions, or for the movement
as a whole. It really is a grassroots movement and that&rsquo;s a
heartening thing to see that it has become very strong in spite of
the fact that there has been very little support.
<br><br>

BR:
 Well, your work is an inspiration to many others, may I say. I think
this really is a David-and-Goliath example that you&rsquo;ve given a
lot of people here.

<br><br>

Are
you hopeful? Are you optimistic? Or are you depressed about the whole
thing, thinking: <I>My God,
we&rsquo;re all about to be wiped out here?</I>
Or do you think that it&rsquo;s just something which <I>is</I>
going to work out well, but we&rsquo;ve got to do a lot of work
between now and then?
<br><br>

JB:
 Well, my <I>heart</I>
tells me without any doubt this is going to work out well for
humanity. My <I>mind</I>
looks at the evidence and I get worried. [laughs] You know,
unfortunately I think we all have to play our roles and depend on
every single person now. The structures of government have failed us.
They&rsquo;re against us. They&rsquo;re actually turning against us
to try and destroy us.

<br><br>

It
really is up to every single individual now to stand up, say &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
and organize to remove these structures once and for all and open the
way for us, every single person, to have a new future of dignity, of
freedom, where we can enjoy our lives free of stress, free of worry
as we were meant to enjoy our lives, and open the way for the next
generation to have proper, healthy opportunities, sensible working
conditions, good education systems, and for humanity to begin a new
era free of these monstrous plots against us.
<br><br>

BR:
 Jane Bürgermeister, thank you so much.
<br><br>

JB:
 Thank you, Bill.
