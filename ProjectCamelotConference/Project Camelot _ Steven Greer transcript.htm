I&rsquo;m Kerry Cassidy from                Project Camelot.</p>                <p class="style7">Bill Ryan (BR):&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m Bill Ryan. This is Sunday,                  the 26th of July, 2009. Have I got that right? I personally                  want to say that I&rsquo;m delighted to be here with Steven                  Greer. <img src="steven_greer_kerry_cassidy.jpg" width="500" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="15" align="right"></p>                <p class="style7">Of all the people who we get emails asking us to interview,                  you are number one on quite a long list. The reason for that                  is that people see Project Camelot as continuing to kick the                  ball that was kicked off by the Disclosure Project back in                  1993. You started something that we&rsquo;re doing our best                  to support you with in terms of bringing the truth to the world. </p>                <p class="style7">Steven Greer (SG):&nbsp; Oh, good. Thank you.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; We want to thank you for that.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Oh, you&rsquo;re welcome. Thank <em>you</em>.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So we have some questions for you, but they might                  not be the most comfortable of questions.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Oh, I can take any questions.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Okay. And we&rsquo;ve heard that you&rsquo;re not                  a wilting violet, as they call it, or whatever. So what we&rsquo;re                  wondering here... because we have different philosophies, I                  think, and different approaches, and I think that&rsquo;s really                  interesting. </p>                <p class="style7">I know that we started out, maybe, at the same place in terms                  of we&rsquo;re taking witness testimony &ndash; and certainly                  you did &ndash; and that tactic was very effective and has                  stimulated us to go down the road we went on. We&rsquo;ve been                  doing this for a little over three years now. </p>                <p class="style7">I just wondered if you have a philosophy that you feel like,                  or a trajectory, that brought you from witness testimony to                  free energy, and if you could talk a little bit about that                  road.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Well, obviously the Disclosure Project involves                  many elements. One is the disclosure of the fact that we&rsquo;re                  not alone. </p>                <p class="style7">The other is that there are highly classified projects that                  have been run illegally for about 50, over 50 years, dealing                  with this. </p>                <p class="style7">And, number three, you cannot say that this has been kept                  secret and it&rsquo;s real without giving <em>la raison d&rsquo;etre...                  Why</em> would something like this be kept secret?</p>                <p class="style7">Now, in the early days it could be argued that, well, there                  were religious issues, that the people would panic at the idea                  that there was life in outer space... or that there were theological                  objections. And in fact these still exist. </p>                <p class="style7">I had a junior Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist say the                  reason that some of the information about the ancient structures                  on Mars has been withheld is that it would &ldquo;collapse                  the foundations of all orthodox religions in the world.&rdquo; To                  which I said: <em>Great! </em>&nbsp;</p>                <p class="style7">I mean, it&rsquo;s time people who think the world&rsquo;s                  6,000 years old and we rode dinosaurs bareback need to get                  a life. </p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; We agree with that.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; <em>[laughs]</em> Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Okay, so that was one area. But the largest one...                  and this is when everything went deep black in October 1954 &ndash; we                  know it to the day &ndash; was because they had actually figured                  out, and mastered, the electromagnetic / gravitic propulsion                  systems. So that was 55 years ago.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Okay, so 55 years ago there was the ability to master                  those technologies. And obviously, when the Rockefeller Commission,                  that reorganized the Department of Defense and the CIA, was                  put together by Eisenhower, what they did was reorganize it                  in a way so that these sort of issues were handled under work                  for other programs, and aerospace contracting entities, and                  high-tech entities, and really took it out of the oversight                  of the president and the Congress.</p>                <p class="style7">And that&rsquo;s when it all &ldquo;went south&rdquo; and                  has been that way ever since. </p>                <p class="style7">The reason for that is because, if you acknowledge that UFOs                  are real, the very next thing that any <em>bona fide</em> scientist                  or policy analyst is going to ask is: <em>Well, how in the                  hell are they getting from one star system to another?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">And when that question is asked, it will be answered, because                  we have people on our team who can answer it in great detail. </p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Yeah, they&rsquo;re not going around in rocket ships.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; And when that is answered &ndash; I&rsquo;m trying                  to finish one thought here &ndash; when that is answered, you&rsquo;re                  going to then see the end of oil, gas, coal, nuclear power,                  all of it. There&rsquo;s a five-hundred-trillion-dollar asset                  base that they&rsquo;re sitting on and protecting. Two or three                  hundred people in corporations in the world control half the                  wealth of the planet &ndash; the net worth of the planet. </p>                <p class="style7">So the secrecy has to be understood within a larger macro-economic                  geopolitical crisis where there&rsquo;s been accretion of enormous                  power in the hands of relatively few people, and that this                  has gotten worse, not better, since the gilded age of the Industrial                  Revolution&rsquo;s dawn. It&rsquo;s actually worse now than                  it was in the time of Cornelius Vanderbilt and the Rockefellers.                  It&rsquo;s worse now than it was.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yeah, I definitely understand.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; So that, I think is&hellip; And so our focus, as                  we&rsquo;ve learned more and more about the reasons for the                  secrecy and the kinds of technologies that are extant, is that                  we have concluded that it&rsquo;s very, very important to be                  able to bring out those energy systems &ndash; at least what                  I call the &ldquo;Level One&rdquo; systems, the ones that you                  could put on a box over here... something about the size of                  a coffee table. And I&rsquo;ve seen these. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, of course, seeing them and being able to bring them out                  and having people release them is another matter. But I&rsquo;ve                  seen them. </p>                <p class="style7">They extract energy from... some would call the zero-point                  energy field, some would call it the quantum vacuum flux field...                  whatever you want to call it. But in the fabric of space-time                  around us there&rsquo;s enormous electromagnetic potential                  that can be touched into and brought out, and that is one of                  the practical implications of disclosure. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, there are many implications. One is informational,                  one is diplomatic contact, and one is the issue of the science                  and technology which could transform the planet, get us off                  of oil, stop global warming, end the crisis of the have and                  the have-nots and the poverty in the world. So that, I think,                  resonates with many people.</p>                <p class="style7">There are a certain number of people who are interested in                  extraterrestrial life. There&rsquo;s a much larger number of                  people who are concerned about the environment, energy crisis,                  the poverty in the world, etcetera.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So, is what you&rsquo;re saying that what you were                  propelled towards is the latter? Because I know your emphasis                  is now really free energy, or it seems to be.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No it isn&rsquo;t. No, no, no.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Well, it seems to be. Maybe I misunderstand&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; You need to not mis-state my priorities. Let me                  be very clear on this. We have three programs going on with                  equal bore &ndash; equal bore &ndash; simultaneously.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Oh, really? Okay.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp;&nbsp; Number one is CSETI, the Center for the Study                  of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, which is an interplanetary,                  interstellar, diplomatic initiative.&nbsp; That was the founding                  entity and it&rsquo;s still the primary focus. </p>                <p class="style7">The second is the Disclosure Project. That started as <em>Project                    Starlight</em> when I was briefing the CIA director and the                    Clintons and all these people.</p>                <p class="style7">It then evolved into the Disclosure Project when Clinton said: <em>I                    won&rsquo;t do it because I&rsquo;ll end up like Jack Kennedy. </em>And                    the Congress people that we met with said: <em>This is too                    big a fish for us to reel in. We&rsquo;re not going to do                    it.</em></p>                <p class="style7">So it kind of devolved onto our shoulders. Then that&rsquo;s                  why we did in 2001 &ndash; to correct the date &ndash; the                  National Press Conference event and the Disclosure Project.                  And that still continues. We still continue to do that.</p>                <p class="style7">Then the third is the OrionProject.org and the focus on trying                  to identify people who have an understanding of these new physics                  and sciences so we can bring out some of the practical applications.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Okay.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; So those three things are going on with equal bore.                  We have teams of people working on all of them.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Oh, I see. </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sort of the coordinator or head of those                  three projects, but they&rsquo;re interrelated. They&rsquo;re                  actually three sides of a pyramid or whatever... not pyramid,                  but three sides of one entity and three facets that are interlocking.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I had a misunderstanding. Part of the reason is                  because&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No, that&rsquo;s good that you brought it up because                  a lot of people do have that misunderstanding.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; &hellip;we get a newsletter. The Orion Project,                  or however you refer to it, newsletter comes into my inbox                  and it is, you know, exclusively talking about more of the                  free energy side of things. So it&rsquo;s a misconception,                  you know, but is out there, as you say. It&rsquo;s very interesting                  to hear that you&rsquo;re continuing these other&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Yeah. And people have to understand... You know                  people say: <em>What about disclosure?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">I say: <em>We have the testimony of 110 of these military                    witnesses out there. We have DVDs and other materials and                    books out there with thousands of pages of government documents.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">We have put this positive proof and testimony out there and                  that then has launched a worldwide disclosure movement in many,                  many countries, as you know.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Mm-hm.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; At this point, when we started that endeavor, it                  was 30 or 40 percent of the public thought these were real.                  Now it&rsquo;s 80 percent. Some countries &ndash; in polls                  that they did recently here in Spain it was 90-some percent &ndash; think                  that we&rsquo;re not alone and ETs are real.</p>                <p class="style7">So we feel that the big over-arching strategy of establishing                  that fact happened. What has not happened is, at least within                  America, an official acknowledgement of the issue and the ending                  of the secrecy. But this is due to a complex problem that I                  work on behind the scenes, for that&rsquo;s where the problem                  is.</p>                <p class="style7">The problem is within Majestic. And the problem is within                  conventional political leaders and the military-industrial                  complex. </p>                <p class="style7">When we started this effort I had about a third of this Majestic                  group who thought what we were doing was something they would                  support. Now it&rsquo;s 70 percent. Now the other 30 percent                  would probably like to see me dead. </p>                <p class="style7">But the point is &ndash; and they&rsquo;re vicious &ndash; there                  are 70 percent of them now who are really lining up. This includes                  the elements within Majestic that are in Europe, that are within                  the Masonics, that are within a lot of secret organizations                  that are fed up with the secrecy and know that we&rsquo;re                  at the end of how far we can take this silly game of secrecy                  and secret power. </p>                <p class="style7">So a lot of the work that I&rsquo;ve been doing, and it has                  directly to do with disclosure, has to do with trying to fix                  that highly dysfunctional dynamic which cannot be ignored. </p>                <p class="style7">You cannot pretend like those lions aren&rsquo;t out lurking                  in the jungle. You don&rsquo;t have to capitulate, but you                  have to try to educate them and give them another vision.</p>                <p class="style7">One thing I say to the people is that people who are addicted                  to secret power, it&rsquo;s... Kissinger once said power is                  the ultimate aphrodisiac... that then the secret power would                  be that on steroids and Viagra and every other thing &ndash; quite                  blunt. </p>                <p class="style7">And so, one of the real issues becomes what can you&hellip; You                  can&rsquo;t just take away. You have to give. </p>                <p class="style7">So my job is to try to also give some of these leaders, both                  conventional leaders and people who are within these classified                  projects, a new vision &ndash; a vision that can guide the                  world out of its current direction, into a path of peace, safety,                  justice, free energy, and a whole new transformation of our                  civilization on this planet &ndash; very quickly. </p>                <p class="style7">Because, you know, we&rsquo;ve run out of time, in my opinion.                  I don&rsquo;t think we have another 50 or 100 years to fritter                  away. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; As it happens, neither do they. I mean, what we                  get from our secret witnesses and from people that are exposed                  to the Illuminati philosophy constantly is that our time is                  running out, in terms of&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">Like, we just heard from a secret witness &ndash; and I&rsquo;m                  running this by you to hear whether this coincides with what                  you know &ndash; that there is around ten months left of food                  before it runs out on the planet, and that there&rsquo;s another                  three to four years&rsquo; worth of oxygen. </p>                <p class="style7">I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if this is down to the minute or                  not, or whether it's more vague than it was stated to me, or                  more... You know, where you would fall in that category, in                  terms of how you understand that.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Let me say that there are a lot of&hellip; My father-in-law                  used to famously say: <em>Paper does not refuse ink</em>; and                  in the modern era, that the computer screen does not refuse                  digits. So, in other words, anything can be said. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, one has to&hellip; My own assessment of that is that                  there are competing interests that try to use whatever axis                  that they have to provide a certain paradigm that is highly                  eschatological. The eschatological axis within Majestic is                  a very powerful one. </p>                <p class="style7">I remember meeting with a member of a Royal Family in Europe                  back in the &lsquo;90s and his entire purpose in providing                  funding to abduction researchers was to &ndash; and I know                  who they are, all the mainline ones &ndash; was so that they                  would put the information out to the public so that the public                  would learn to hate enough of the aliens so that we could have                  an interplanetary war, which would be the Armageddon that would                  precipitate the return of Christ. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yeah, we&rsquo;ve heard this.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Now, this was a very specific <em>Opus Dei</em> perspective                  and that is really what is driving&hellip; It&rsquo;s like                  Ahmadinejad in Iran saying that, well, it&rsquo;d be okay if                  we went to nuclear war with Israel because that would force                  this Twelfth Imam, which is their return of their Christ, to                  return to Iran.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; So this eschatological <em>end the world</em> perspective                  is&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So you&rsquo;re actually saying... Just to cut to                  the chase here, you&rsquo;re saying that this man&rsquo;s testimony,                  to what I just said about ten months and four years, is basically                  him being programmed by the controllers, in a certain sense.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;through a glass dimly&rdquo;.                  In other words, yes, we&rsquo;re headed for a crisis. Yes,                  we&rsquo;re headed towards a <em>hiatus</em>, can I call it                  that, in the situation. </p>                <p class="style7">But what they don&rsquo;t understand is that it is the end                  of one era and the opening of another. It isn&rsquo;t the end                  of life on Earth. It is not going to be the end of the human                  race on this planet. These are all&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; We would certainly agree with that.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; This is&hellip; And so the conflation of certain                  misinterpreted spiritual traditions, whether it&rsquo;s from                  the Book of Revelations or elsewhere, or the Mayan calendar                  and 2012, has created this sort of eschatological juggernaut &ndash; which                  is very Scientological, it&rsquo;s very Majestic, and it has                  a lot of underpinnings within the philosophy of why the secrecy                  has continued on like it is.&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">This is one major axis of why the secrecy is continuing. The                  other one is the technological and money and control, the macro-economic                  control of the planet.</p>                <p class="style7">My point to people is that... For example, now I&rsquo;ve                  been doing this for 19 years and I&rsquo;ve had&hellip; You                  know, if you brief the CIA director you&rsquo;ve had some good                  access, and that&rsquo;s 16 years ago. My family put the first                  man on the Moon. So I have had access to people within classified                  projects for a lot of my life. </p>                <p class="style7">For example &ndash; and I know that we&rsquo;re going to probably                  disagree on this because I saw what you wrote on your blog                  after my talk last night &ndash; there are people who have                  been exposed to what they wanted them to see. This Bob Lazar                  was one that they then allow to speak out.&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">Now the question is: <em>What&rsquo;s the agenda behind that                    allowing?</em></p>                <p class="style7">I have had more than a dozen people who have worked in facilities                  in Dulce and in Pine Gap in Australia and other places where                  they have actually been <em>growing</em> the Gray and Reptilian                  species that people <em>think</em> are ETs. </p>                <p class="style7">And the people who&rsquo;ve been in the projects <em>think</em> they&rsquo;re                  working alongside an alien &ndash; and they&rsquo;re not. They&rsquo;re                  absolutely what are called <em>nano-bio-machines</em> and they                  are <em>Programmed Life Forms</em>. There is no question that                  that is going on. </p>                <p class="style7">So the larger question becomes: <em>If someone comes up to                    you with just an empirical observation, what is it they&rsquo;re                    seeing?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Now I&rsquo;m going to cross over into something even more                  controversial. </p>                <p class="style7">We have some people at Lockheed, and another program... I                  can&rsquo;t say where it is but it&rsquo;s in the South in                  an underground facility, and its chief scientist is someone                  I knew very well. </p>                <p class="style7">They have developed electromagnetic systems where they can                  put someone into a state, and they can go into &ndash; and                  this gets into a cosmological, complex discussion now &ndash; a                  lower astral, or denser astral field. And some would call this <em>demonic</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">They can actually see beings and creatures there and bring                  them in three-dimensional and materialize in flesh and blood &ndash; through                  these electronics. </p>                <p class="style7">So a lot of these things that people are seeing have nothing                  to do with interstellar and extraterrestrial. </p>                <p class="style7">So when I&rsquo;m talking... when I talk about the interstellar                  civilizations that also have transdimensional capability...                  You can&rsquo;t go through interstellar space at the speed                  of light or less.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s a cosmological indigestion happening                  within ufology and disclosure that I find disturbing because                  people are conflating <em>interdimensional</em> with <em>extraterrestrial</em> with <em>PLFs</em>,                  that are Programmed Life Forms, man-made. </p>                <p class="style7">All of this is being put together as if it is one thing, and                  it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s, unfortunately, much more complex                  than this. This is exactly why&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; We would agree with that as well. It&rsquo;s very                  complex.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; This is why, when Martin Cannon, back in the late &lsquo;80s,                  put together a 2000-footnoted paper and collection proving                  the military-human involvement with abductions, and that the                  creatures they were using were not ET... It wasn&rsquo;t some                  alliance between Majestic and these ETs. The ETs wouldn&rsquo;t                  bother with &rsquo;em.</p>                <p class="style7">Now, I say they&rsquo;re <em>aliens</em>, but they&rsquo;re                  not <em>extraterrestrials</em>. Okay? And now we&rsquo;re getting                  into&hellip; and people say I&rsquo;m being cheeky. I&rsquo;m                  not, because these are very bizarre creatures. Some of them                  even&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to take it one step further.</p>                <p class="style7">You&rsquo;ve all heard of Roswell, and you&rsquo;ve all heard                  that there have been a number of electromagnetic weapons systems                  that have targeted and knocked down interstellar vehicles...                  not at a great kill rate in the early days.&nbsp; &ndash; I                  hate to use the words <em>kill rate</em>. It&rsquo;s terrible. &ndash; But                  it&rsquo;s become more and more efficient since SDI, and since                  the &lsquo;90s, particularly in the last five or ten years.&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">What happened, however, in the early days... They had enough                  crude stuff. And of course, we had things like the Philadelphia                  Experiment &ndash; which did not happen in Philadelphia. It                  happened in Rhode Island. That was just a cover story... that&rsquo;s                  another whole discussion. </p>                <p class="style7">But that was in the &lsquo;40s. So there were very advanced                  electronics that were already being used. And by the time the                  extraterrestrials showed up when we were detonating nuclear                  weapons, we were able, at Roswell, at our only nuclear bomb                  squadron, to have one of these weapons and a radar dome, or                  configuration, that caused the two of those to crash.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; There were bodies on that. Some of them were living,                  and I have a witness who actually handled one of the living                  ones as late as 1950-&rsquo;51 here in Virginia not far from                  where I live, at Camp Pearry <em>[spells]</em> P-E-A-R-R-Y,                  a very top secret facility.

So the highly compartmented programs that                  deal with this issue&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; And this is the thing: Everyone talks about antigravity                  and this and that, but what they forget are the enormous advances                  that have happened between the early &lsquo;40s and now in                  genetics and bioengineering and neuroscience. </p>                <p class="style7">Those have gone into application where they now have created                  these creatures that people think: <em>Oh, that&rsquo;s an                  extraterrestrial.</em> I say: <em>It is NOT an extraterrestrial!</em> </p>                <p class="style7">So the whole thing has deliberately become confused so that                  people will make an assessment that there are the good aliens                  and the bad aliens. </p>                <p class="style7">And if we step into that &ldquo;cowboys and Indians&rdquo; mindset,                  they can then divide the human race into another war footing                  that will fulfill the Majestic plan that was hatched in the &lsquo;50s,                  that will take us, as Douglas McArthur said in his last address                  to the Congress, to interplanetary war, which is the World                  War III they want.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; So most of retail ufology &ndash; I would say 90-plus                  percent of it &ndash; has embedded within it this message and                  this information and these images for the purpose of Majestic.                  Now, I think people do it completely innocently because&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. </p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; I want to ask a direct question here because this                  is personal, and I haven&rsquo;t said this on camera before.                  So here we go. I&rsquo;m an abductee, and I&rsquo;m a mountaineer.                  I was abducted out of my tent in December, 1981 in the Himalayas                  on the slopes of Makalu, which is in Nepal on the border of                  Tibet. And that wasn&rsquo;t done by the military. </p>                <p class="style7">This was done in December, in winter in the Himalayas. I was                  taken out of my tent, floated over the glacier in the middle                  of the night and it was minus 40 degrees. This wasn&rsquo;t                  the military who were doing that. They couldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not saying all contact has been military.                  I&rsquo;m being very specific. I&rsquo;m saying that there&rsquo;s                  enough&hellip; Let&rsquo;s look: If you have a nugget of gold                  and you dump a whole bunch of fool&rsquo;s gold on it&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; &hellip;and no one&rsquo;s doing an assay. And the                  question becomes: <em>What part of it is extraterrestrial,                  what part of it is interdimensional&hellip;</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly.</p>                <p class="style7">SG: <em>&nbsp;&hellip;what part of it is manmade?</em> And                  what part of it is some mixed-up, where people...? </p>                <p class="style7">And here I&rsquo;ll make it a little more complicated. There                  are people who&rsquo;ve had ET contact and when these classified                  projects find out about it they will then target them for an                  abduction so that their paradigm and their perception of this                  will become confused. This is&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Okay. I think what happens here... We are aware                  of this level that you&rsquo;re talking about. We&rsquo;re                  aware of all these different dimensions because we&rsquo;ve                  basically... (&ldquo;dimensions&rdquo; &ndash; not <em>dimensions,</em> but &ldquo;dimensions                  of this argument&rdquo;) ... because we&rsquo;ve been exposed                  to these levels by different secret witnesses, okay? </p>                <p class="style7">But, and I think if we have a disagreement, what it is, is...                  I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s <em>completely</em>, you know?                  It&rsquo;s not an either/or question. It&rsquo;s a <em>how                  much?</em> It&rsquo;s a percentage, as you say. </p>                <p class="style7">It&rsquo;s going to be: Is there, sometime, abductions that                  are ET-related that are <em>real</em> ET-related &ndash; okay? &ndash; and                  handled by a certain group of ETs? Is there a MILAB element                  to it, and is that maybe the largest portion? Highly probable.                  Okay?</p>                <p class="style7">But is it exclusively that there are only good ETs? I think                  that when you extrapolate that, that&rsquo;s where I have a                  problem. </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; I think the problem is with the caricature of the&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Because I think that that&rsquo;s, philosophically,                  a problem of a limited way of looking at reality.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No, I think the problem is a Manichean                  view that has to divide entire species into good and bad. This                  is precisely what Hitler did when he would say, you know, the                  Jews are bad and they&rsquo;re dirty and they&rsquo;re this&hellip; I                  think we have to be extremely careful&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary to do that                  quite so much as it is in terms of the overall&hellip; I mean,                  were talking universes. Okay? We&rsquo;re talking multiple                  species out there that go beyond this solar system, certainly&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m very aware of that. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; &hellip;and we&rsquo;re talking about life in general,                  okay, so&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; But the point is that&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think we can sit here and make a statement                  like what I heard you say on stage yesterday, which was: <em>There                  are no bad ETs</em>. I mean, how absurd.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No, I think you could say that there is no evidence                  that the planet has been invaded by <em>hostile </em>&ndash; is                  the word I used &ndash; civilizations that have an intent&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So far, to you; that you have not&hellip; In other                  words&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t prove a negative.

But it is the point. You can&rsquo;t prove                  a negative, but what you can do is go with the evidence that                  you do have. </p>                <p class="style7">One of the sets of evidence we have through CSETI, which has                  gone around the world and made contact all over the world with                  thousands of people... We have never had a harmful event happen.                  We have never had anything resembling anything that has frightened                  or harmed anyone on the contact team.</p>                <p class="style7">On the other hand, we have had members of our team that have                  been targeted with these psychotronic-related military-type                  abduction events, including myself.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right. I agree.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; So, what I have to go with is the evidence that                  I have. I also know that there&rsquo;s the <em>stage craft,</em>                  to use an Institute for Strategic Studies document that I have,                  that talks about the stage craft of abductions because of its                  psychological warfare value to the agenda of an <em>Us versus                  Them</em> Manichean  worldview                  that would redound to the benefit of the military-industrial                  complex. So this is very circular.</p>                <p class="style7">I think that what I&rsquo;m saying is one has to be very careful                  if you&rsquo;re going to be involved with disclosure and contact                  in saying: <em>This group is bad, this group is good. </em></p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;re good and we&rsquo;re bad.

I think that the paranoia over interplanetary                  war <em>per se</em>, and that scenario, is laudable, okay.                  In a certain way we understand that you&rsquo;re coming from                  a heartfelt perspective when you talk about <em>Let&rsquo;s                  not get caught up in polarities. </em>Okay? </p>                <p class="style7">But what we don&rsquo;t want to do is analyze this scene,                  this scenario, and the realities that are out there, and say                  we&rsquo;ve come to definitive statement where we can say: <em>There                  are only good ETs.</em></p>                <p class="style7">Now, let me tell you why that&rsquo;s dangerous as well, because                  what that does is leave people, humans, and humanity possibly                  in general, in a vulnerable position. They are then going around                  following ET like the Pied Piper down whatever road they&rsquo;re                  taken.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No. I&rsquo;ve always said, and unfortunately you                  haven&rsquo;t read my books and things, but&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Actually I have.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Well, I have made it very clear that there are two                  things that are equally dangerous &ndash; the deification of                  these visitors or the demonization of them.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Exactly.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Both are equally dangerous, and I&rsquo;ve said                  this since the &lsquo;90s.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Then we&rsquo;re in agreement.

My point is that we&rsquo;re living in a universe together;                  we&rsquo;re going to have to live together in that universe.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely!</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; The solutions are not going to be name-calling and <em>We&rsquo;re                    better than you are</em> and <em>Those are in service to                    self</em> and <em>Those in service to others</em> and this                    whole thing. </p>                <p class="style7">I think we have to look at this from a much larger picture,                  and that is not only Earth, but the whole cosmos is going through                  a quantum moment.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right, that&rsquo;s true.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; It is not just an Earth moment.

There&rsquo;s no way&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Well, if they were here and they were invading and                  they were hostile, they would not have waited for us to have                  the kind of weapons we have today. They would have absolutely                  shut this civilization down in 1945.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; On the contrary... I mean, we have to actually get                  into a whole socio-political look at what it is to be an ET                  space-faring culture in search of planetoids or planets, and                  building new environments, and then what you do with them. </p>                <p class="style7">In a sense, you can actually take the Earth as a microcosm                  and you can look at <em>How did it go when we took over different                  continents here&hellip;</em> </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Yeah. But see, this is the whole problem&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; <em>&hellip;and what was the model?</em> Then we                  get to space and we also have to figure&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; This is a huge problem.

This is why, if you                  look at&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; There is a <em>philosophy</em> that there&rsquo;s                  a quarantine. </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No. There <em>is</em>. If you look at even what                  Neil Armstrong said after&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Why? Because an ET told you?

It&rsquo;s in Timothy                  Good&rsquo;s book, <em>Above Top Secret</em>. You can read                  it.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Yep.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m sure you have. You&rsquo;ve read it.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; A mind-controlled astronaut is what you&rsquo;re                  talking about. You&rsquo;re gonna give me testimony from a                  mind-controlled astronaut.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No, no. </p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s hear where this goes. I&rsquo;m interested.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; He said that when... We were basically warned off                  the Moon, and that&rsquo;s why we didn&rsquo;t continue to                  go.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And I believe these warnings exist. There has been                  evidence that we&rsquo;re warned off Mars because certain craft                  have never made it there, have been shot down, have disappeared,                  have had technical problems that haven&rsquo;t been explained                  by NASA.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Well, and one can put a xenophobic spin on that.                  Or one can say that perhaps there&rsquo;s a wiser cosmic order                  that says that until a civilization reaches a certain amount                  of civility for the civilization, and peace, they are not allowed                  to travel amongst the stars; that the entry ticket <em>is</em> peace.                  And I think that <em>is</em> the situation.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Okay, I understand that&rsquo;s your philosophy. </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No, it&rsquo;s not my philosophy. It&rsquo;s what                  the evidence&hellip; This is not how I started out. This is                  what I have found to be true from many different witness testimonies                  and the observation overall and accurate&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But our witness testimony would contradict that.                  So what do you do with that?</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Well, fine, I&rsquo;d like to speak to them.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely, and maybe we&rsquo;ll have to                  compare notes. You know, really, to be honest with you, this                  is valuable, because what happens, for better or for worse,                  is we&rsquo;re both out there. We&rsquo;re both investigating                  these questions and they are open questions. Actually, the                  information has&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; They are. But I think it&rsquo;s rather unhelpful                  that you go onto a blog and say that what I&rsquo;m saying                  and doing is sinister. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But I said it was&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG: &nbsp;I think that, you know, I have never said anything                  harmful about you. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s insidious.

You know, you invited me to                  an interview.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to provide an interview.

So the point is&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; <em>[laughs]</em> It&rsquo;s mutual. See, you don&rsquo;t                  know this and I&rsquo;m sorry we didn&rsquo;t have time to                  tell you our philosophy of how we conduct an interview, but                  I did kind of warn you&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; You obviously want to have a debate.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; &hellip; that we have differences of opinions.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; We have differences of opinion, and that&rsquo;s                  fine, but I think the most dangerous thing we can do is with...                  See, everyone has partial information.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; To start making sweeping judgments that are negative...                  And you can say: <em>Well, it&rsquo;s not negative. We&rsquo;re                  just saying that they&rsquo;re in service to self versus service                  to others,</em> and couch it however you wish. </p>                <p class="style7">But if we go down that path, we&rsquo;re already creating                  a new cosmological <em>Us versus Them,</em> which is the absolute                  recapitulation of the mistake on Earth for the last 10,000                  years. I think we can do better than that. I think we have                  to learn to look at these things&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">And let&rsquo;s say that everything that your philosophy and                  how you&rsquo;re viewing this is correct.

Now that goes on on the diplomatic                  front and between nations on the Earth, and I think we have                  to be very careful not to engage in that sort of anthropocentric                  projection of the current state of duality of the human condition                  on these visitors. I think it may be much more difficult to                  make those kinds of assessments. </p>                <p class="style7">But if we go down that path, what we&rsquo;ll be doing is                  that we&rsquo;ll be dragging the baggage of the old era into                  this pivotal time, this embryonic time, where we&rsquo;re trying                  to transition to a new civilization &ndash; the hallmark of                  which <em>will</em> be universal peace.&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to be going into a period                  of time of competing planetary systems having wars.

That&rsquo;s not a polarized position.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Right. But let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; And it doesn&rsquo;t mean we want to shoot them                  in the head, either.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Okay, but let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s true. I don&rsquo;t                  think it is true but maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. It&rsquo;s possible,                  I mean. I don&rsquo;t pretend to know everything. Maybe I&rsquo;m                  wrong. </p>                <p class="style7">But let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s true. What might have instigated                  that? </p>                <p class="style7">Now, let&rsquo;s go back 100 years. We&rsquo;re in horse-and-buggies                  and rifles and things. My grandmother, born in the late 1800&rsquo;s                  post-reconstruction South, saw her son design the Lunar Module,                  put the first man on the Moon, and now her grandson doing what                  I&rsquo;m doing. </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;ve gone from horse and buggies to the capacity for                  interstellar travel and antigrav, and dematerialization and                  transdimensional technologies, from gunpowder and the early                  stages of the Industrial Revolution. At the same time we&rsquo;ve                  gone from rifles and machine guns to thermonuclear weapons. </p>                <p class="style7">Is it a coincidence that the sort of <em>Pandora&rsquo;s Box</em> that                  opened when we started detonating thermonuclear weapons was                  because it was having an effect beyond just the Earth, transdimensionally? </p>                <p class="style7">Is it possible that the trajectory they saw our civilization                  going on, these ones you think may not have our best interest                  in heart, may have seen us going on a trajectory that, if it                  continued on that trajectory would lead to us going into their                  neighborhood with weapons of mass destruction, with our unchecked                  simian tendency towards war-making and what have you?</p>                <p class="style7">So, I&rsquo;m trying to say let&rsquo;s look at this for just                  a moment through another perspective that&rsquo;s non-human,                  if we can. It&rsquo;s very difficult because we are human.                  I think&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I met Robert Solace. He watched the craft fly over,                  okay? In Montana, the missile silos, and turn them off. I&rsquo;ve                  talked with him in his house about these experiences, as you                  have in your Disclosure Project&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re totally on the same page on that. There&rsquo;s                  no doubt whatsoever that they came and they are absolutely                  adamant that this technology not go... first of all, not happen                  on the Earth&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; It would destroy the planet.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; &hellip;but second of all, not go beyond. It&rsquo;s                  actually interdimensional in its destructive ability.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Correct. Yes, I&rsquo;m very aware of this.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So, I think we&rsquo;re in agreement on that.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; In other words, what kind of hornets nest did we                  pick? And therefore, what kind of provisions and things are                  going on as a consequence of that? So, I always say&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">You know, everyone starts getting into the, oh, <em>This alien                    agenda</em> and <em>That alien agenda</em>, and I would say: <em>What                    would be more constructive is that the human agenda be fixed.                    That we learn to live on this planet and fix&hellip;</em> </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; No disagreement there.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; &hellip;<em>fix our own home. Create a peaceful                    civilization rather than worrying about other motives from                    other civilizations.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">Here&rsquo;s what I predict. I predict that if we were to                  do that, and learn to live together without clubbing each other                  over the head and killing each other on this planet &ndash; <em>as                  below, so above</em> &ndash; that we would see a change, perhaps,                  in the cosmic order for that reason.</p>                <p class="style7">So, rather than engaging in debates and speculation about                  the agenda, perhaps harmful aliens and this and that, I would                  say why don&rsquo;t we create a civilization of abundance and                  of peace and of enlightenment here? And go into space with                  that intent and see what the response to the cosmos will be                  then? </p>                <p class="style7">It may be the response that we&rsquo;re getting now is a directly                  proportional response, karmically and otherwise, to what we                  have been doing to each other.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely. We are attracting... like a mirror. </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; You know, in the last 100 years we have killed <em>160-million</em> of                  our own fellow humans. I think that if you reflect on that...                  And I was seeing an interview with Robert McNamara towards                  the end of his life where he was reflecting on the terrible                  mistakes he made in Vietnam and the other wars of the 20th                  century. </p>                <p class="style7">What I think is that there needs to be a sort of <em>Let&rsquo;s                    look at ourselves</em> and I think that many times&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But let&rsquo;s not do that to the exclusion. It&rsquo;s                  not an either/or question. In other words, what I hear you                  saying is let&rsquo;s be a little more sort of Earth-centered                  in our view of reality and not worry about the agendas of those                  other beings out there. And let&rsquo;s concentrate on building                  our nest and making it a good, healthy place, and playing nice                  with each other. There&rsquo;s no disagreement with that.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No, it&rsquo;s not either/or. I&rsquo;m saying let&rsquo;s                  do that. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re doing the OrionProject.org.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; We have absolutely no disagreement with that.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re also doing the contact,                  diplomatic effort. And we invite all these&hellip; We always                  invite all these civilizations to make contact.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But actually you&rsquo;re assuming that there&rsquo;s                  no intervention going on. And I think this is getting to the                  root of the question. In other words, do you know about <em>screen                  memories</em>? You must know about them if you&rsquo;ve been                  as deep as you have.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Well, yeah, the psychotronic programs that have                  been in existence for many years&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; All right, because you obviously have a positive                  view of all your interaction. And, you know, not to get personal                  on this level, but to say that if I meet a being who thinks                  they&rsquo;ve only had positive interactions with certain ETs                  or animals or whoever they are, then I might look at that person                  and I might question... </p>                <p class="style7">This is my issue &ndash; I might question whether or not that                  person really knows what they&rsquo;re having because they                  might be screen-memoried and they might actually be having                  some negative interaction in there and not know it. Now, obviously                  I&rsquo;m not&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; So you&rsquo;re back to the positive and the negative                  and the polarity&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; But we live in a 3-D level and we are moving to                  the 4-D&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; And see, this is... The whole point is that&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Actually it goes beyond that, so don&rsquo;t interrupt                  me, because I want to finish here.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that simple.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Absolutely, and we agree on that. It is <em>very</em> complex.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Right.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re multidimensional beings. We live on                  lots of different levels. We are spiritual beings first&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Mm-hm.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; &hellip;and humans second. Okay? We actually are                  just inhabiting these human bodies at the moment, in my view.                  Okay?</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Correct. Short-term lease.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I have had a number of Samadhi experiences myself,                  so I totally know where you&rsquo;re coming from with that,                  and I appreciate that. But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact                  that it is <em>extremely</em> complex, this picture of what&rsquo;s                  going on here. </p>                <p class="style7">None of us have all the answers, and to make definitive statements                  that we feel you are making out there &ndash; okay? &ndash; and                  to actually limit... to put blinders on to such an effect to                  say: <em>There is nothing to be worried about, at all, humans                  out there. Just worry about your own little playground.</em> And                  meanwhile, out there, are... </p>                <p class="style7">Because I got to tell you, if you&rsquo;re aware of psychic                  and you have psychic perception, you know there are entities                  that do not have bodies that <em>are</em> negatively oriented.                  Now &ldquo;negative,&rdquo; again, becomes a judgment. And                  how do you want to call negative&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Those aren&rsquo;t <em>extraterrestrial</em>. Now                  you&rsquo;re confusing the whole cosmological&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not confused. On the contrary, I&rsquo;m                  using an example&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never denied that there were those kind                  of entities...</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Okay. Fine.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; But those aren&rsquo;t extraterrestrial, physical&hellip; Some                  of this may be definitional.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I know that. Let&rsquo;s extrapolate from there.                  I&rsquo;m simply focusing, right now, on what you might term                  a &ldquo;negative entity&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t have a body,                  and I&rsquo;m saying&hellip; </p>                <p class="style7">Or you could even say fire. Now, fire is an entity. It&rsquo;s                  a non-&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t have a body, and yet it has                  a power, it can create itself. So, in a sense you could say                  it&rsquo;s negatively oriented if it burns your house, but                  on the other hand it could keep you warm.</p>                <p class="style7">So by the same token we could find entities that are in physical                  bodies &ndash; &nbsp;again, spirits having a physical experience &ndash; which                  could be an ET, it could be us&hellip; it&rsquo;s so multidimensional.                  Don&rsquo;t you see what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Oh, absolutely. </p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; In other words, if they are spirits as we are spirits,                  then they can be moved by the positive polarity as they could                  be pulled by the negative polarity. </p>                <p class="style7">It could look, from the dimension of being in this 3-D world                  that we&rsquo;re inhabiting called Earth, in this human body,                  in this experience, and how they impact us, could in fact be                  ultimately negative to our growth cycle. That is, in fact,                  something that has been posited as a very real possibility. </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Well, anything is possible. I mean, obviously. I                  just don&rsquo;t see the evidence for that. I do see the evidence                  for humans killing each other. I do see weapons in space where                  we have targeted these visitors&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I appreciate that.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; &hellip; and all of that. So, I mean, we can talk                  in circles all day on this.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yeah. Sure.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; My position is that there has not been an action                  against the Earth and humanity from an extraterrestrial, interstellar,                  physical civilization to here, that I think would cause us                  to want to have a sort of armed conflict response. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, are there experiences people have that they interpret                  as negative? Absolutely. </p>                <p class="style7">I&rsquo;m going to tell you something, and people don&rsquo;t                  like to hear this, but in a major trauma case, if a child comes                  in and there&rsquo;s no time for anesthesia, and I have to                  put a chest tube in the chest wall of that child, I must look                  like the most horrible monster and devil that ever lived. </p>                <p class="style7">My <em>motive</em> is to <em>save</em> that child. My motive                  is to <em>help</em> that child. But to anyone seeing it who                  would just walk in from another planet or off the street, they&rsquo;d                  go: <em>What is that monstrous doctor</em>&hellip; or <em>What                  are they doing?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; You&rsquo;re doing what you must.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; And what my motive is, is that I&rsquo;ve                  got five minutes or less to save that child&rsquo;s life. So,                  all I&rsquo;m                  saying is that this sort of anthropocentric&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a matter of perspective.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; &hellip; and it is a matter of perspective. I think                  that&rsquo;s why I prefer to be cautious, cautiously optimistic,                  put out a positive view on how we should be interacting with                  this thing. It is not irresponsible. I am not insidious. I                  think that these sort of characterizations are highly offensive,                  as I have never attacked you folks publicly. </p>                <p class="style7">I found I was attacked on your blog today. It was unfortunate.                  But my perspective, I want to be very clear&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; No, no. Your <em>philosophy</em> was attacked. <em>You</em> were                  not attacked.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Yeah, well, whatever.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Actually, you were complimented.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; But I just have to say that that is why we&rsquo;re                  wanting to be cautious because it is so easy for humans&hellip; I                  mean, look what happened after 9/11. It is so easy for humans                  to take shreds of information and then go on a war footing                  or go on a conflict footing.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; We agree with you.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; This is the inherent danger of some of the things                  that you&rsquo;re saying, is it can shove humanity.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yeah, okay. I understand.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Okay. And there&rsquo;s one thing to have a private                  conversation about speculating about the motives and the agendas                  of the aliens, but when you start talking to the people of                  the planet about this and you start putting out&hellip; and                  positing that there are these &ndash; and to use your word,                  and the polarity negative and this and that &ndash; this <em>would</em> throw                  the planet into&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">And it would also throw the planet completely into the camp                  of Majestic, who for years has been trying to... and has also                  taken presidents aside, like Reagan, and tried to convince                  them of exactly the argument you&rsquo;re making so that he                  would spend hundreds of billions of dollars on SDI. I think                  this gets into serious policy issues.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yeah, yeah.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Okay. And I have responsibilities here that you&rsquo;re                  not aware of. So to say I&rsquo;m irresponsible... You don&rsquo;t                  know what my responsibilities are. And therefore&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; I want to&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No you do not! What I&rsquo;m saying here is that&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; I want to ask a question which is very&hellip; I                  want to take this back, now. Just wait a second, let&rsquo;s                  cool down and I want to just make an analogy. </p>                <p class="style7">Now, an analogy that I sometimes use, and it                  usually results in nods of agreement, is that we&rsquo;re like                  fishermen on a South Sea island, in the middle of the Pacific                  Ocean, having believed for generations that we&rsquo;re the                  only people in the whole world. </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;re sitting around a campfire cooking our fish and                  we&rsquo;re trying to figure out: <em>That big metal ship on                  the horizon, what do they want with us? That metal bird that                  keeps on circling around our island, what are they doing? Is                  it real? </em>And<em> Did you see it? </em>And all this kind                  of stuff.</p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;re trying to figure out the intentions, assuming                  that we believe in their existence, of these other beings that                  we&rsquo;re suddenly starting to realize might exist in our                  universe on this little tropical island.&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">Now, the problem is that if we really do look at this as a                  human situation which is quite real, really, what experience                  do we have as South Sea island fishermen to figure out &ndash; </p>                <p class="style7"><em>Maybe they want to cut our trees down. Maybe they want                    to save us because the sea level&rsquo;s rising and they                    want to take us to another island. Maybe they want our minerals,                    or maybe they want to convert us to Christianity. Maybe they                    want to eat us, kill us, or maybe they want to make friends.</em> How                    do we know?&nbsp; </p>                <p class="style7">The danger is &ndash; and this is a question now &ndash; the                  danger is that I&rsquo;m here around this campfire with you                  guys and I hear you saying those other men in those big ships                  and those metal birds <em>must be friendly</em>. </p>                <p class="style7">And I&rsquo;m saying: <em>Wait a minute. We need to be a little                    bit careful here because, actually, even though we do get                    into fights on this little island every now and then, how                    do we know we can trust them? Maybe we can, maybe we can&rsquo;t.                    What&rsquo;s your experience?</em> </p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s an attempt to characterize, by analogy, how complex                  this is. That&rsquo;s why I said that it was irresponsible,                  as I would do if I was around that campfire, as an elder of                  this community saying: <em>They&rsquo;ve got to be friendly,                  we&rsquo;ve got to trust them, you&rsquo;ve got to trust them. </em>This                  is what the Incas said about the Conquistadors!</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Yes, but your metaphor is, again, an anthropocentric                  projection onto something that I think is non-applicable. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that, in addition to that, our... I keep coming back                  to this. Not only in my personal experience, but the experience                  of hundreds of people, thousands of people, that we have had                  involved with our diplomatic contact programs, have not had                  any of this sort of experience that would lend us to believe                  that there are civilizations that are hostile to the Earth                  and to humanity.</p>                <p class="style7">On the other hand, I have had many sources describe to me                  the Programmed Life Forms, the military involvement with hoaxing                  abductions, a false-flag operation to create an alien threat                  that we can unite against. </p>                <p class="style7">So I have to go on the knowledge and the experience I have,                  and it isn&rsquo;t just observing something from afar, because                  we&rsquo;ve actually had contact. We actually have more information                  than something just floating up above the island. So the analogy                  breaks down very quickly. </p>                <p class="style7">And even if there was this potential for one or more of these                  planetary civilizations to be of concern to us, my answer would                  still be the same:</p>                <p class="style7"><em>There needs to be engagement. There needs to be a diplomatic                    d&eacute;tente. There needs to be a rapprochement. There                    needs to be an enlightened approach to this where we really                    move out of a sort of duality that leads to conflict on Earth.</em></p>                <p class="style7">I think that regardless of what your assessment of the agenda,                  the path of wisdom and safety is that.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Okay, we don&rsquo;t disagree with that, okay? Let&rsquo;s                  talk about where we agree&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; I agree fully, and it needs to be in the public                  domain.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I mean, we certainly agree on the end objective.                  Okay? The end objective, from our point of view. Okay? We are                  not part of the military-industrial complex. Okay? </p>                <p class="style7">We&rsquo;re doing what we do because we believe in truth,                  because we&rsquo;re dedicating our lives. And, indeed, our                  lives literally have been in danger because of what we believe.                  We do it on a daily basis and you, of all people, should understand                  this.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; Mm-hm.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; So we&rsquo;re not taking this lightly. Our end                  result is not to be what <em>they</em> may desire as <em>their</em> ultimate                  end-game. In other words, we&rsquo;re not here to support their                  end-game and we&rsquo;re not na&iuml;ve about what we&rsquo;re                  doing either. So neither of those things is true. Okay? </p>                <p class="style7">We are not trying to promote sort of a fear-based paradigm                  such that people get into a place where the only thing they                  can think of is to shoot ET in the head, to be graphic, or                  to allow for space-based weaponry.</p>                <p class="style7">I mean, we basically agree with your philosophy in that way,                  wholeheartedly. In fact, I would say, we are dedicating our                  lives to that. </p>                <p class="style7">However, on the other hand, we are also not going to sit here                  and pretend that we know all the answers. And we&rsquo;re also                  not gonna assume that all contact is positive. On the contrary                  to what your&hellip;</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; You&rsquo;re going to say whatever you think.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Yeah, obviously we are. But in terms of this discussion                  and for the reason that we&hellip; You know, you&rsquo;re sort                  of saying our blog thing, our posting, you found offensive                  because we&rsquo;re saying... What you&rsquo;re saying on stage,&nbsp; and                  again, you&rsquo;re on stage. You&rsquo;re on stage actually                  more often than we are, far more often &ndash; and I have to                  say, therefore your responsibility is great.</p>                <p class="style7">Perhaps your approach is a bit simplistic in that you are                  assuming that if you talk about the potential that there are                  other things going on, or a potential for other ways of looking                  at the question, that the jump that the whole audience out                  there is gonna make immediately is to fear and panic. And that                  they&rsquo;re gonna jump on this bandwagon of the military-industrial                  complex, and all go out and grab their guns and knives and                  want to go shoot ET and fight with each other and other worlds,                  and so on. That&rsquo;s not... In other words, you&rsquo;re                  going from... </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; But the problem is, is that I&rsquo;m completely                  aware that my position is the minority position. Okay? I&rsquo;m                  acutely aware that.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; Actually, that&rsquo;s not true either. I mean,                  there are plenty of people out there that are advocating peace                  and love, and getting on their cars and jumping up and down: <em>Please,                  ET, come save us because you&rsquo;re all good.</em> </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; No. I would actually challenge you to look at Hollywood,                  the UFO community, the books and videos that are out on this                  subject. They are overwhelmingly negative and terrifying. I think                  that this is one of the problems.</p>                <p class="style7">BR:&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; I think that one of the problems is that we have                  to look at this with a long view. And the long view, as I see                  it... And this is all I can do is go by my own moral compass                  and what I think is right. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m irresponsible.                  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m simplistic, and all these sort                  of characterizations. </p>                <p class="style7">I think that I have a responsibility to help articulate a                  path forward that is wise and that does not redound to further                  fear and panic and negativity on this planet, but that moves                  us forward in a positive way and that can lead to what I&rsquo;m                  certain will be the future for this planet.</p>                <p class="style7">That&rsquo;s one of, not only world peace, but universal peace                  and a wholly, completely new, transformative civilization on                  this planet that isn&rsquo;t thousands of years off or even                  decades off now. I think it&rsquo;s very, very near. </p>                <p class="style7">So, I think that that&rsquo;s what I wish to articulate. There&rsquo;s                  no simplicity to it. It&rsquo;s actually a rather complex concept.                  It&rsquo;s also a way of engaging spiritually.</p>                <p class="style7">I want to share a dream I had. I don&rsquo;t share this very                  often, but... Back when my friend Shari and I and another member                  of my team all got metastatic cancer in the same month and                  we were all going to die. She died, but she was still alive.                  And Bill Colby had died, been killed trying to help us just                  before this. It was a terrible time, actually, for me.</p>                <p class="style7">I had a dream. And, of course, I&rsquo;m human. I was angry.                  I was mad as hell at what was happening to us. </p>                <p class="style7">I had a dream &ndash; I think I was in England doing some                  crop circle work &ndash; and in the dream there were these                  giant lions that were stalking me. They were going to try to                  kill me. (It&rsquo;s funny because Dr. Tom Bearden talks about &ldquo;the                  lions&rdquo; of this cabal, and I&rsquo;d never heard him use                  that term at the time I had the dream.) </p>                <p class="style7">But here were these huge lions, and they were stalking me                  and they were going to kill me. And it was this lucid, lucid,                  full-color dream. </p>                <p class="style7">I didn&rsquo;t run. I didn&rsquo;t get angry. I didn&rsquo;t                  have hate in my heart. I opened my heart and went to a place                  of universal love and consciousness and I engaged each lion                  in their eyes. </p>                <p class="style7">We were doing this, following each other around, and eventually                  they became so engaged with that energy that, even though they                  had huge claws and fangs, they actually flipped over on their                  back and I was petting them like this, like they were big pussycats.                  We had become&hellip; It completely diffused that situation.</p>                <p class="style7">I use that as an analogy of sort of an <em>aikido</em>, spiritually,                  of the engagement I&rsquo;m endeavoring in, both with the public,                  with Majestic, with the visitors. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m                  doing.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I understand. </p>                <p class="style7">SG:&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it in summary.</p>                <p class="style7">KC:&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s a great description of your                  approach and what&rsquo;s motivating you.
