<br><br>

KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  We&rsquo;re very honored to have Alex Collier join us.
This is pretty much unprecedented. He does not speak, as you may
know, often or even has in quite some time.

<br><br>

So
I just wanted to say that I got a message over a year ago that the
Andromedans wished to speak and that they wished Alex Collier to come
to Camelot and that we could provide a service or a platform for
that. So we&rsquo;ve been working to have that happen. It&rsquo;s
taken quite some time.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
really happy that this can happen today and we just want to say thank
you very much for making this possible to the hidden beings here and
around us at this time.

<br><br>

So,
Alex, I&rsquo;m actually not going to give you a big introduction
beyond that today. I&rsquo;m going to let you speak for yourself.

<br><br>

Ladies
and Gentlemen, Alex Collier. [applause]
<br><br>

ALEX
COLLIER (AC):  Can you all hear? All right. Great. I want to thank
all the speakers. I was at home yesterday watching the streaming and
God, they were just... you know, George Green, and just all of the
speakers &ndash; just fantastic. They give so much.
<br><br>

I
know that all of you here give so much and you try in your own way to
share the Light. I mean, there&rsquo;s two ways to be the Light &ndash;
one is to be the candle and the other is the mirror that reflects the
candle.

<br><br>

We
live in an extraordinary time on Earth. I mean, absolutely
extraordinary. In the next several years, you&rsquo;re all going to
think you&rsquo;re living in a science fiction movie. You are living
in a science fiction movie, except it isn&rsquo;t a movie, it&rsquo;s
reality.

<br><br>

If
you want information on me, I think there&rsquo;s some on the Web,
both pro and con.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
just going to get right into it. I&rsquo;m going to give you some
updates and then we&rsquo;re going to talk about some things that I
was specifically asked to speak to you about from Morenae.


<br><br>

Einstein
said: <I>You cannot solve the
problems of the world with the same thinking that created them</I>,
and that is no more relevant than it is today. We have enormous
problems, or challenges &ndash; I should say: <I>challenges</I>
&ndash; that take enormous amounts of brainstorming and solutions.

<br><br>

The
difficulty in trying to solve some of the issues that we have is the
fact that we do not have all the data. The two gentlemen that were up
here prior to, alluded to that. So did Robert Dean; Mr. Green; Bill
and Kerry have; so many of the speakers, as we keep trying to go
forth and gather all the information to try to solve this out.
<br><br>

I,
like many of the other speakers and each of you, have a small piece
of the puzzle. Now, we&rsquo;re going to talk about some of that
today.

<br><br>

I
know that there&rsquo;s an awful lot of talk about Disclosure. I know
that in the Exopolitics community, there&rsquo;s a great deal of talk
about Disclosure.

<br><br>

I
personally don&rsquo;t believe the United States government&rsquo;s
ever going to admit it. It&rsquo;ll probably come from another
country, India or China, first. Or the extraterrestrials themselves
are going to show themselves and just say: <I>Hey,
this charade&rsquo;s gone on long enough</I>,
which is probably the highest probability at this point. We will talk
about some of that today.
<br><br>

I
had honed my presentation for an hour because that&rsquo;s what I
thought I had, so in talking about solving the problems, at the very
top of our power structure, the planet Earth lives in a pyramidal
power structure.

<br><br>

Extraterrestrial
civilizations no longer use that power structure &ndash; the
pyramidal power structure. They have been using a holographic ever
since the end of the Orion Wars -- which would be in our linear time
about 360,000 years ago.

<br><br>

Since
then, most of the civilized, benevolent civilizations, including some
of the rogue regressive groups &ndash; and they are a minority &ndash;
have been using a holographic social structure, and we&rsquo;re going
to talk about that today.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
also going to talk about creating a new <I>Domain
of Knowing</I>, a space in
which we can create an opportunity for Earth to be mentored, because
we need some help here. We are a little bit in over our heads.
[laughter]
<br><br>

So,
it takes me a little while to warm up here; I&rsquo;m a little rusty.
[laughter]
<br><br>

As
of the last several days, much of the Cassini project has been
classified. The reason for that is because of all the mother ship
activity that has now been filmed and documented in the Saturnian
system, around Saturn.

<br><br>

We
also have, a million-and-a-half miles off of the South Pole, a
20-mile craft that has sat and is stationary. NASA and other
organizations&rsquo; telescopes have been monitoring it for eight
months. They watch its trajectory to us. It is now stationary and
there are craft going in and out of this 20-mile structure. I don&rsquo;t
know any more about it than that.

<br><br>

I
also want you to know that there is a very large planetary structure
coming in, 18 degrees right ascension of Neptune&rsquo;s orbit. It
should be visible sometime in the next year.

<br><br>

There
is an awful lot going on and, of course, you&rsquo;re all paying the
bills and no one&rsquo;s being told anything about it.

<br><br>

Now,
it goes far deeper than <I>spooking
the herd</I>. That is really
not the intention here at all.

<br><br>

The
intention here, and what&rsquo;s really been going on, is simply
this: Bob Dean made a reference yesterday to almost feeling sorry for
the government about the situation that they&rsquo;re in. I would
have to concur with him on that, in the fact that the government made
some treaties, cut some deals for technology, in exchange for
experimentation and observation... and they were tricked.

<br><br>

They
really did not know what they were getting themselves into, and now
the hand has been dealt.

<br><br>

There
are many people within the UFO community that say that all the
extraterrestrials are benevolent. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is in my
own personal opinion, and based on the knowledge that I have, that
that is completely irresponsible to say. [applause]

<br><br>

We
live in a duality, because if it was all love and light, we would not
be going down this road to global fascism and the Powers That Be
wanting to eliminate two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s population. That
is not love and light.

<br><br>

So,
we have a lot of things to cover, and a lot of things are going to be
occurring.

<br><br>

The
economic situation is what it is. Mr. Green gave a fantastic
presentation yesterday. There is absolutely nothing that I disagree
with him about. He made a reference to buying gold and silver. I
think that&rsquo;s a really good idea. However, you cannot eat gold
and silver.

<br><br>

It
is imperative that you start storing food and I will tell you simply
why. If they do crash the dollar, which they are going to do in order
to create a global currency and a global government, you won&rsquo;t
be able to buy food. He made reference to the currency being devalued
six-to-one in the next several months. Gasoline will go to $18, $20 a
gallon. Truckers will not be able to deliver products. What you have
is what you&rsquo;ll have.

<br><br>

It
is imperative to, if you can, start forming within your community,
community gardens, figuring it out. You need to start talking about
this.

<br><br>

I
know most people are simply not open to it. Just do the best you can.
I mean, we&rsquo;re all fighting the fight.

<br><br>

Now,
America is on the front line of this and the reason is simple.
America created a new <I>Domain
of Knowing</I>. America was
created to get rid of the aristocracy of the Old World, to create
something new, to create individual liberties, to create personal
freedoms. That was never known in the world before.

<br><br>

We
have that, and because of our apathy, we have lost virtually all of
those. It is no one else&rsquo;s fault. It is our own fault.

<br><br>

We
have known since The Sixties that the CIA has been trafficking
narcotics. We know this. We have known that the CIA has been
assassinating and overthrowing governments.

<br><br>

We
have known that there&rsquo;s been a cover-up of what there is on the
Moon and inside our Solar System. We know this. We know that there is
extraterrestrial life. We know this. That is no longer the
discussion. We know that the government has become corrupt.
<br><br>

The
people &ndash; the personages &ndash; that rule the planet are not
<I>us</I>.
They are not <I>human beings</I>.
And I will say this with my very last breath: They are not <I>us</I>.
[applause]
<br><br>

Now,
what happened was that they took over because they think
holographically. It was very easy to get around the pyramidal power
structure on Earth because it&rsquo;s completely obsolete everywhere
else out there.

<br><br>

So,
if you come in using a holograph, using holographic thinking, what
you do is you create your structure everywhere so no matter what
happens, whether one group gets taken out, another group gets taken
out, is gone -- the other components are still there to rise up and
still manage and control, because each of these components have a
picture of the whole.

<br><br>

They
have all the technology and everything they need to continue to
control and dominate and brainwash. We&rsquo;re over our heads here,
but we&rsquo;re not alone.

<br><br>

Now,
what happened was they took over. It was very easy to take over the
governments: You dangle technology, you dangle knowledge, you dangle
ancient history, and you give them this technology <I>in
secret</I>. <I>You
have it. We&rsquo;re going to give it to you.</I>
The United States of America made this mistake.
<br><br>

So,
Bob Dean, again; Mr. Dean made a reference yesterday to the missing
trillions of dollars from the Federal Reserve. I have been told it&rsquo;s
$24 trillion dollars, is what they carry on their books, and
virtually most of that has gone into the secret space program and the
colonization of our Solar System.

<br><br>

You
can choose to believe that or not. It doesn&rsquo;t matter and it
doesn&rsquo;t change the reality of it.

<br><br>

So,
what happened was, the pirates took over the ship. The governments,
realizing that they had all this technology and that they were a
thousand years more advanced than we were, instead of telling
everyone: <I>Hey, we have a
problem here,</I> and
standing tall and doing the right thing, they joined the pirates.

<br><br>

We
are literally only now, as passengers on the ship, finding out and
realizing that we&rsquo;ve been hijacked. That&rsquo;s the movement.
And many people are going to have a very difficult time when they
realize that reality is not at all what they think it is or what they
thought it was. Even those of us who have been exposed to this for
many, many years have <I>&ldquo;Oh
shit!&rdquo;</I> moments.
[laughter] It&rsquo;s impossible not to, you know?

<br><br>

Yes,
our politicians sold out. It was easy to corrupt them. [sighs] We
have an enormous mess. They&rsquo;re stuck in the middle as well.

<br><br>

Over
the next year, year and a half, there&rsquo;re going to be so many
changes.

America
is the focal point here of this and the reason for that is because
Americans, despite our educational system, are still very smart. We
are very able to think out of the box. We are excellent
problem-solvers and we are armed to the teeth. They constantly will
have to be looking over their shoulder unless they take us out.

<br><br>

Ladies
and Gentlemen, that&rsquo;s the goal. They cannot have a World
Government without taking out the U.S. &ndash; and I mean taking it
to its knees.

<br><br>

Now,
this is not where the whole presentation is going, but it&rsquo;s
important to give you this background because the world used to look
to us for the ideals of freedom. Immigrants all over the world have
come to America. My grandparents were immigrants to this country,
because they believed in individual liberties. They believed in
freedom. They believed in the principles that were in the
Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of
Rights.

<br><br>

Ladies
and Gentlemen, <I>that</I>
is who we are. We are not the crap that they show you on television.
[applause]

<br><br>

Gentlemen,
you are not the weak-kneed, sissy morons they try to portray us on
television, either. You are strong; you are family-oriented; you have
faith, and you are warriors. And you&rsquo;re going to need to take a
stand and defend your country and your family. Make no mistake about
it.

<br><br>

The
two gentlemen that were here talking about the Super Soldiers? Yeah.
They&rsquo;re here. They&rsquo;re definitely here. They&rsquo;re
hybrids. They&rsquo;re here, and there&rsquo;s more that&rsquo;s been
going on.

<br><br>

I
was hoping that one of them would talk about what happened in Dulce,
New Mexico, but they did not. And I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to
go there either because... [sighs] ... Oh, God, it&rsquo;s sick. It&rsquo;s
sick. [audience response, questions]
<br><br>

Now
I... There&rsquo;s other things to cover, but I bring it up because
many people that have the knowledge, that have been in Black Ops,
Special Ops, that have been involved in the ET component, know about
that small rogue group &ndash; and they&rsquo;re not gone yet. Some
of them are still here. All right? And they still create and wreak
havoc.



I
also want to tell you &ndash; and I have been asked to share this
with you &ndash; about the vaccine, the new swine flu vaccine.
Morenae
has told me to tell you or everyone that this vaccine will
permanently damage your DNA. So, whatever else comes out of that, it
will permanently damage your DNA. [applause]
<br><br>

Now,
many of us in the community and in the world as a whole, we can&rsquo;t
even agree on what the problem is and because of that, we will never
even agree on a solution. So it&rsquo;s imperative that open dialogue
continue to occur.
<br><br>

I
know that for those who have been in the Exopolitics &ndash; that&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;m basically calling the UFO community, <I>Exopolitics,</I>
now &ndash; you have had a remarkable amount of patience. And your
biggest tests are coming, because as more and more of this
information comes out, more and more people are going to want to ask
you, who they thought were crazy: <I>What
the hell&rsquo;s going on?</I>


<br><br>

They&rsquo;re
going to want to know. And you&rsquo;re going to have to try, in a
very calm manner, explain it to them even though you yourselves are
going to have all the butterflies &ndash; you&rsquo;re going to be
wondering: <I>How the hell am
I even going to deal with this?</I>
&ndash; Because you have some background information.
<br><br>

Now,
this ET component is really about us. It is our destiny to travel the
stars. It is our destiny to continue to move out and colonize space,
especially our own Solar System. It is not our destiny to be killed
by vaccines and war.

<br><br>

You
will have to make those choices. My choices are already made. My
decisions are clear. I am the father of five children. There is no
way I&rsquo;m going to back down and I&rsquo;m going to sell them
into slavery. Never going to happen! [applause] Okay? You need to
make your own choices.
<br><br>

Okay.
I once asked Vissaeus,
one of the Andromedans who has since crossed over, what was to become
of us. (Some of this may be a review for some of you.) What was to
become of us? What was going to happen to our race, to our
civilization?

<br><br>

He
just looked at me and he said: <I>This
is how we see you: Responsible, freedom of self-determination,
becoming truly self-confident and free, to unconditionally be
responsible for oneself without being </I>coerced<I>
to accept some higher authority.</I>
<br><br>

In
our Galaxy, [as] the more advanced the civilizations have become in
the center of the Galaxy, the riffraff had to start moving out to the
outskirts of the galaxy. The riffraff &ndash; just like <I>Star
Wars</I>, okay? We are in the
boonies and that&rsquo;s why we have some riffraff here. We&rsquo;re
not the only planetary race that is having problems with the
riffraff.

<br><br>

But
what&rsquo;s unique about us is that, genetically, we are considered
-- to the Andromedan race &ndash; [to be] genetic royalty.

<br><br>

I
have been saying this since day one: <I>We
are extremely unique</I> and
it&rsquo;s because of that uniqueness, we have enormous strength. We
have enormous capacity for emotions. We have enormous intent and
drive to not only survive, but to create. What we lack is faith in
ourselves.
<br><br>

At
the end of World War II... Well, let me put it another way: The Nazis
didn&rsquo;t lose the war. Okay? Germany lost the war, but the Nazis
were brought here and to Russia.

<br><br>

Now,
the mind technology, the mind control, the space technology, the
reverse engineering, the technology that they had been given prior to
the war by a small group of extraterrestrials from the star system of
Aldebaran,
was brought here and honed and polished and combined with other
technology that the Zeta
Twos [Zeta Reticuli 2], the Dows [Ed note: spelling of &ldquo;Dows&rdquo;
is uncertain; googled and found nothing.] -- what many
folks know as the Grays &ndash; all those began to compliment
each other; remarkable technology.

<br><br>

Technology
we absolutely need here. I mean, the combustion engine has been
obsolete for 70 years. I understand that India also is now going to
experiment on wireless electricity. Hell, Tesla did that in 1902 in
Colorado Springs. We know it works. Okay? But those that were funding
his experiment asked him: <I>Where&rsquo;s
the meter?</I> And he says:
<I>Well, there is none. It&rsquo;s
free.</I> They shut it down.
<br><br>

The
question is... well, we&rsquo;ll get to that. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m
jumping around here.
<br><br>

The
reality is, Ladies and Gentlemen, what kind of country do you want to
live in? What kind of world do you want to live in? Clearly what
we&rsquo;re doing now doesn&rsquo;t work &ndash; it has run its
course.

<br><br>

We
have a government that has a lot of problems. We have corruption
within it... not all of it, but we clearly have corruption within it.
They have sold out and have been totally compromised. They themselves
don&rsquo;t know what to do and their only solution is to turn the
power of the military and the power of the pharmaceutical companies
against the American people. That&rsquo;s their solution.
<br><br>

That
is not okay. That&rsquo;s not okay!

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
time for the UFO, the Exopolitics community, to start creating
another <I>Domain of Knowing,</I>
and that Domain of Knowing is two things: <I>What
does a holographic social structure look like? How can we live with a
holographic social structure, mirrored after some of the principles
that our Founding Fathers laid, but it wasn&rsquo;t perfect? </I>

<br><br>

What
could we do now? And we&rsquo;re not just talking about the United
States. This has to be a global thing; this has to be a global
movement. What does that look like?

<br><br>

So
we need to create and start groups, dialogues, talking about living
in a holographic structure where all the information that is
available &ndash; Black Op, Secret, Top Secret, Above Top Secret &ndash;
is available to everyone.

<br><br>

We
could just start with the information that we do have; the rest of it
will come. It&rsquo;s going to collapse on itself because it&rsquo;s
no good. It cannot stand on its own. The minute we turn our focus
away from them and they can&rsquo;t feed off our fear, it will
collapse in a heartbeat. Because where focus goes, energy flows.
<br><br>

As
long as they keep you looking at it, they are using the energy of
your soul, of your spirit, to feed this monstrosity. It&rsquo;s time
to just ignore them. Turn your focus away and let&rsquo;s create what
we really, really want &ndash; but we have to decide what that is.

<br><br>

Along
with that, I have been asked to start asking people to talk to people
&ndash; you&rsquo;re the first to hear this &ndash; about what would
it look like for you, for Earth, and we&rsquo;ll start with the
Exopolitics community. What would it look like for you to be mentored
by several benevolent extraterrestrial races? What would that look
like?
<br><br>

What
would we need to do to establish, not only that communication, but at
the same time have us feel safe, with checks and balances, so that
they could walk their talk and we have to walk our talk?

<br><br>

Open
mentorship is our destiny. It&rsquo;s going to happen anyway, but we
cannot wait for the government to turn itself around. It can&rsquo;t
because it&rsquo;s not in control. Right? It is not in control. So,
we have to turn our focus away from all that drama and figure out
another way.
<br><br>

What
I want to do now is read to you what I was given way-back-when
regarding creating a <I>Domain
of Knowing</I>. This also
came from Vissaeus:
<br><br>

<I>Create
another Domain of Knowing, communicating, and being. In other words,
the domain of calling forth or generating your intent needs to be
more distinct. </I>

<br><br>

<I>Your
physics, as you call it, is a good example of this calling-forth.
There have been men on your planet who have called forth new domains
of thinking that never existed before here. </I>

<br><br>

<I>They
invented it. They didn&rsquo;t fantasize it, they didn&rsquo;t
pretend. They literally created this new context from what you now
call physics. </I>

<br><br>

<I>Your
humanity is strong with this kind of example. No being, however,
makes the distinction that this is what they are. </I>

<br><br>

<I>I
would like to give you an example: your concept of human rights. It
wasn&rsquo;t so long ago that no such thing existed on your planet.
It just simply didn&rsquo;t exist. You Terrans did not have any
rights. Only the kings and the priests had their rights, but most of
you Terrans do not have any rights. So you and other Terrans created
human rights from nothing. </I>

<br><br>

<I>You
created the domain that created not only the rights to come forth,
you created the language and then you communicated it, and this
communication that you gave had power because it was full of intent.
It has the power not only to represent and to invoke, but also to
literally bring it into being. </I>

<br><br>

<I>This
is what your races need to do in order to clearly know yourselves.</I>
<br><br>

Now,
in talking about that, let&rsquo;s talk about religions for a moment.
The pyramidal structure of our governments primarily have come out of
ancient Rome, and Rome was essentially controlled by 13 families.
Those 13 families still exist today.

<br><br>

Many
of the world&rsquo;s religions, though they&rsquo;ve had a tremendous
amount of value and have brought an enormous amount of comfort to
many people in our history and in our present day, they focus on
shame, guilt, sin, and control.

<br><br>

Ladies
and Gentlemen, that&rsquo;s the trap. They don&rsquo;t focus on
self-responsibility. They don&rsquo;t focus on life or respect. They,
in fact, create more division than we have ever known.

<br><br>

Now,
did they start out that way? With the exception of the Roman Catholic
Church &ndash; I&rsquo;m just going to be blunt about it &ndash; no.
But the Powers That Be are masters of infiltrating movements. What
they do... and I&rsquo;ll give you the best example I can give you is
that of a charitable foundation.

<br><br>

A
foundation is created using the power of the people and the monies,
the resources of the people, to do something that is of a benefit to
humanity. As it&rsquo;s moving and it begins to gain power and it
starts to spread and shift consciousness, awareness, the Powers That
Be will walk in and say: <I>Hey,
we really believe in what you&rsquo;re doing and we&rsquo;re going to
give you a 25-million-dollar grant to help you continue to do your
work. But we want to put one of our members on the Board, just to
make sure that the money is spent wisely.</I>


<br><br>

Then
they do it again, and now you have a second Board member. And now you
have a third Board member, and before you know it, that movement,
that foundation, instead of going up and creating more consciousness,
more awareness, is now heading the other way. Now they also control
the wealth of that foundation.

<br><br>

We
have been thinking in a pyramidal structure and a third density
structure. They&rsquo;re in fourth density and holographic. We have
to think the same way and we have to be talking about: <I>How
is it that we got ourselves into this?</I>


<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
essential that we put blame to the side for the moment. There&rsquo;s
plenty of that and there will be plenty of that.

<br><br>

What
we need is the knowledge. We need to know how these structures work,
so that we can create something different, something in total
opposition to it, because I can&rsquo;t imagine everybody&rsquo;s
happy with the way things are.

<br><br>

And
this isn&rsquo;t just about the United States. This is about the
global population because the extraterrestrial races don&rsquo;t see
us as separate countries. They see us as one race, and we&rsquo;re
all between a rock and a hard place, pretty much &ndash; at the
moment.
<br><br>

Taking
personal responsibility is huge<I>,</I>
but it really is the first and the biggest step to achieving full
consciousness.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
going to read you a quote that I found. It&rsquo;s from a gentleman
named Little Hawk. He&rsquo;s a Native American Indian with the
Mohawk tribe: <I>Take credit
for your mistakes, not what you do good -- because you&rsquo;re
supposed to be doing good anyway.</I>
<br><br>

We&rsquo;ve
all made mistakes; we&rsquo;ve all screwed up, but that&rsquo;s part
of the learning process. If you had all knowledge and you were
all-seeing, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to be here. So collectively and
individually, we need to start looking at the world and saying: <I>What
has my contribution been?</I>


<br><br>

Now,
I&rsquo;m not talking about going out and trying to save the world.
It&rsquo;s not about that at all. It&rsquo;s really about each one of
us individually. It&rsquo;s about being the Light. It&rsquo;s about
not feeling shame for our mistakes. It&rsquo;s about absolutely
learning that you are not a sinner. That is such crap that I want to
vomit every time I hear that.

<br><br>

You
are not a <I>sinner</I>!
You are a spiritual being in a physical body, or as George Green
said, <I>Rent-a-Wreck.</I>
I liked that. That was really cute. Okay? [applause]
<br><br>

Now,
look at the structure that is overlaying us: Governments of control
and dominance; a monetary system that controls everything.
Corporations and banks that own the debt of every nation, which means
literally they&rsquo;re in control, because they have the debt. We
have medical and pharmaceutical companies who have had cures for
cancer and other diseases that now want to damage your DNA with
untested vaccinations.

<br><br>

Imagine
how afraid they are of you! Can you just for a moment imagine how
afraid of you they are? And now you&rsquo;ve got to ask yourself the
question: <I>Why are they
afraid of you?</I>

<br><br>

Because
we are awesome, awesome Creator-Gods. We have the ability to create
reality, to bring it forth, to call it forth, and they have done
everything they can to continue to make sure that we believe we&rsquo;re
powerless.

<br><br>

This
is why so many extraterrestrial races are coming here now -- because
they know different. On some level, Ladies and Gentlemen, we
consciously have called forth this drama. This is really about us. We
have called this forth.



This
is really about us. It&rsquo;s not about them. And we need to step
into our power here. We need to fully understand it&rsquo;s time for
us to step into our power as a planetary race, and not see the
borders anymore.

<br><br>

Now,
I would not be that opposed to a global government if it was set up
with a constitution like the U.S. Constitution and an Absolute Bill
of Rights. But even then, that&rsquo;s not a guarantee, because if
people don&rsquo;t defend those rights, if people don&rsquo;t defend
their liberties, what good is it?

<br><br>

We&rsquo;ve
just experienced that. Okay? We&rsquo;ve just experienced that. In
1913, when the Federal Reserve took over, that&rsquo;s when the train
started going the other way, and here we are a hundred trillion
dollars in debt &ndash; an absolutely ridiculous number. It&rsquo;s
probably higher. Who knows?

<br><br>

Now,
in creating our holographic model of a civilization or a social
structure, do we want to have a monetary system? Do we actually <I>need</I>
a monetary system? Because we&rsquo;re the only ones that I&rsquo;m
aware of in our Galaxy that still use a monetary system.

<br><br>

In
fact, many, many years ago I had been asked by Morenae,
Vissaeus to put
together a short presentation on money. They already knew about it,
but I did the best that I could.

<br><br>

When
it was over, Vissaeus just looked at me and he goes: <I>I
don&rsquo;t understand.</I>

<br><br>

And
I said: <I>What do you don&rsquo;t
understand?</I>

<br><br>

He
says: <I>I don&rsquo;t
understand why you have to pay to live on a planet you were born on.</I>
[laughs]
<br><br>

Ladies
and Gentlemen, that has haunted me ever since. That little bit, just
that one little thing, takes you completely out of the box. For the
first time you begin to think: <I>Well
jeez, what would it look like not to have a currency?</I>
You know?

<br><br>

Advanced
civilizations: <I>all their
needs are taken care of</I>.
All of their standard day-to-day life needs are met by the
government, no strings attached, and then you donate your time and
your expertise and your skills to do something you want that benefits
the whole. I&rsquo;m not talking about communism, either. It&rsquo;s
something bigger than that, but we need some help in defining what
that is.

<br><br>

Now,
we have a lot of really brilliant, intelligent people here; here and
in the world. I know other people around the world have been talking
about similar things. Creating a different society, and maybe even a
holographic society, and what that looks like, a holographic power
structure, so no matter what happens, it will totally always stand on
its own.

<br><br>

The
Founding Fathers tried to do something like this when they created
all the states as equal, in control, and separate from the
government. That was pretty much their intent whether they realized
it or not.

<br><br>

I
also want you to know that we have a lot of help. We are getting a
lot of help from the spiritual side as well as the dimensional side &ndash;
and I&rsquo;m not talking about just dimensional beings. I am talking
about, also, extraterrestrials.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ll
give you an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about: The vision at
Valley Forge of George Washington. I know that a lot of people on the
Net... if you&rsquo;ve not researched it, I suggest that you do. Some
say it&rsquo;s a hoax. It&rsquo;s not a hoax.

<br><br>

I
also want you to know that Thomas Jefferson in his dairies, was out
walking at his estate in Monticello, was trying to figure out the
verbiage, the language, in regards to the Declaration of Independence
when he was met by a hooded man, who he never really clearly saw, who
gave him the conversation and the pieces that he needed to finish the
Declaration of Independence.

<br><br>

I
also want you to know that in the Constitutional hall, when everybody
was bantering and going back and forth and it looked like no one was
going to sign the Declaration of Independence, up on the top railing
of the hall a man appeared out of nowhere, and for 20 minutes, gave
an oration about how important this was &ndash; not only to the
United States and to the moment &ndash; but to the entire world as a
whole. As soon as he was done, everybody rushed to the table and
signed the Declaration of Independence.

<br><br>

Benjamin
Franklin and the Sergeant-at-Arms went upstairs to try to talk to
this man because they wanted to know who he was. There were armed
guards at every single door. The armed guards swore no one went in,
no one went out.

<br><br>

So,
there is Divine providence here, Ladies and Gentlemen. It is not a
mistake that you live in this country. It is not a mistake that you
are who you are.

<br><br>

Enough
is enough! It is time we step into our power, and very simple steps
will do this. First you have to make a decision and the decision is:
<I>No more bullshit. Okay? No
more bullshit!</I> [applause]
<br><br>

America
is the reason it is, because we allowed it to happen by our apathy.
Okay? We have elections. We know we&rsquo;re voting for the lesser of
two evils. We know that, but we do it anyway.

<br><br>

I
also want you to know that the President of the United States is not
in charge of our government. [laughter] He&rsquo;s just not. I want
you to know that there are 47 layers of Top Secret clearances <I>above</I>
the President of the United States. Forty-seven layers!

<br><br>

You
want to know your secret government? That&rsquo;s your secret
government. He can&rsquo;t even get a clearance. He doesn&rsquo;t
even know who to talk to, to get a clearance to find out about this
stuff.

<br><br>

So,
it is important that we turn our focus a little bit and we start
creating something different. This is what the founders did. This is
what many people have done throughout the world. The Renaissance was
something exactly like this. They threw off Rome and they tried to do
something different &ndash; Rome, the church, the government of Rome
-- they threw it off and they tried to create something different,
and it went for a while.

<br><br>

Mentoring:
The conversation in the Exopolitics community, in my personal
opinion, is no longer<I> Do
UFOs exist?</I> It&rsquo;s
completely irrelevant. We already know they do.

<br><br>

<I>Where
do they come from?</I> That
has some validity. <I>Is it
metal?</I> That doesn&rsquo;t
have any validity; it doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is: <I>Why
are they here? And what can we do to learn from this experience?</I>
<br><br>

Now,
the reason that many of the extraterrestrial groups &ndash;
benevolent &ndash; are not talking to the government is because they
know they&rsquo;re compromised.

<br><br>

I
will tell you that there has begun some mentoring, off-world, of our
military. Off-world. It has begun, but that is such a small piece.
What really needs to happen is we need to create a new <I>Domain
of Knowing</I> and we need to
call this information directly to ourselves. No more middle-men. They
can&rsquo;t be trusted. We have to do it ourselves.
<br><br>

Now,
how do we go about that? I don&rsquo;t have all those pieces. The
idea was to share it and plant the seed inside of all of you to start
thinking about: What does mentoring look like?

<br><br>

How
would you imagine extraterrestrials coming down and saying: <I>Okay
folks, you have pollution. We can help you with that, but these are
the steps you need to do. Here&rsquo;s the technology that </I><I>already
exists</I><I> on your planet
to do this, and here is how you need to use it responsibly.</I>


<br><br>

Again,
self-responsibility.
<br><br>

Food,
the growing of food; water&hellip; Ladies and Gentlemen, we have the
technology to have all the drinking water we want &ndash; just build
desalination plants. We have all the water we need. But they won&rsquo;t
spend a dime on any of that, because if you don&rsquo;t have water,
they have control over you.

<br><br>

We
have so much technology. We have free energy on the Earth. Tesla did
it in 1902. We know it exists. Okay?

<br><br>

A
hydrogen engine in a car was built in 1955 and did 110 laps at the
Indianapolis 500 Race Track. The plans were bought by Gulf-Western
Oil and never seen from again. That&rsquo;s 1955. [laughs] There&rsquo;s
just so much! There&rsquo;s so much.

<br><br>

The
<I>Law of Consistency,</I>
which is what the Andromedans call their holographic civilization, is
set up like this:

<br><br>

Every
child, whether they understand the knowledge or not, is given the
latest and greatest technology or knowledge, information, data, as it
arrives. It starts at the youngest level. It doesn&rsquo;t start at
the top and stay there and then they decide: <I>Well,
we&rsquo;ll wait till they&rsquo;re 25 to tell them about it.</I>


<br><br>

It
is not the same song. We need the children to evolve to advanced
maturity a lot faster than they are. Yes, they&rsquo;re growing up
pretty fast, but not to advanced maturity.

<br><br>

Every
single piece of information, every single tool that is available, is
available to everyone, across the board. The children that graduate
from school in the Andromedan civilization are smarter than their
parents and no one has a problem with that, because they inherit the
society. They&rsquo;re the ones that continue to go out and expand
the society and create the holographic pillars of their society.
<br><br>

We
are completely going backwards here, and if that isn&rsquo;t evident
to everyone, I don&rsquo;t know what is.

<br><br>

The
Law of Consistency is that every truth is spoken, everyone is
forgiven, there is no monetary system. There is an absolutely free
healthcare system, but it has nothing to do with pharmaceuticals.
[applause] It has to do with color, light, and sound, which is what
we are, even in our physicality: color, light, and sound.
<br><br>

It
has to do with the advancement of the soul. We have a damaged DNA
structure, so when we reincarnate, we do not always remember things.
There are people who do great jobs doing past life regression and
people can pull some of those pieces. But to have cognizant memory
when you come back into physicality is something we don&rsquo;t have
presently. They have that because they don&rsquo;t have a damaged DNA
structure.

<br><br>

Can
our DNA structures be repaired? According to them, absolutely yes,
but we need to make some changes.

<br><br>

We
need to create the space for us to be free enough to explore those
possibilities. We cannot do that with the power structure that&rsquo;s
in existence today, so we need to create another <I>Domain
of Knowing,</I> and that
begins with yourselves.

<br><br>

The
love that you withhold is the pain that you carry lifetime after
lifetime. It all begins with us, each one of us individually.

<br><br>

Now,
Ladies and Gentlemen, if we work, start thinking, start talking about
a mentoring relationship, what that looks like. How would we want to
put it together? Even go so far as to say: <I>Okay,
here&rsquo;s where we want to do this. Here&rsquo;s how we want to do
it. Who do we want present? Do we televise it to the masses?</I>


<br><br>

Everything,
every detail. They absolutely will meet us halfway. They are not
going to come in here and save us or rescue us from ourselves.
They&rsquo;re not going to do it.

<br><br>

If
any of you are familiar with the Andromedan information, one of the
things that was first shared with me when I became an adult was that
in our Galaxy, tyranny showed up very unexpectedly. And them, and
other races that are part of the Andromedan Council, have come back
in time to this moment on our planet and the other star systems that
are having problems with the pirates, to this time period.
<br><br>

This
shift in consciousness here is what flips it either way. They&rsquo;re
going to intervene and they have been intervening in very, very
subtle ways, because no one wants to live in tyranny, not now or in
the future. No one does.

<br><br>

So
this is our moment. This is our moment as a humanity, as a race, to
really decide: <I>Are or are
we not going to unite as one?</I>
Are we or are we not going to watch each others&rsquo; back? Are we
or are we not going to stop taking crap from bureaucracy?

<br><br>

We
have to make a decision and that decision is upon you, and you&rsquo;re
going to be forced very, very soon to make a decision. And I&rsquo;m,
you know, I&rsquo;m not just talking to you folks here in the
audience. I know that this is being streamed and I know that these
DVDs and things have a life of their own. I know that better than
anybody.

<br><br>

The
time is now and all it does, it starts with you, just to make a
decision &ndash; okay? &ndash; to do something, to be radical, to be
a rebel again.

<br><br>

Most
of us guys in this audience, we know what that&rsquo;s like, being a
rebel. We grew up shooting guns, chewing toast into the shape of a
pistol. Okay? Rescuing the damsel, excited about the next adventure
-- we know about that, you know? That&rsquo;s part of who we are. We
are not domesticated lap dogs. We&rsquo;re just not. And I&rsquo;m
not going to be!

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
not talking about going out and causing crimes. I&rsquo;m talking
about defending yourself, your liberties, your rights, your family
and your community. Because nobody else is going to do it for you. In
fact, they&rsquo;re all working against us, and even they don&rsquo;t
realize what they&rsquo;re doing &ndash; they really don&rsquo;t.
Because so much information is compartmentalized, they don&rsquo;t
realize the big picture.

<br><br>

But
many people are waking up very, very quickly, and I know I&rsquo;m
preaching to the choir in that. But it&rsquo;s amazing to see how
many people are waking up and questioning everything.
<br><br>

This
is our moment. The next several years is our moment and it really
needs to begin now. 2012 is not the end of the world &ndash; isn&rsquo;t
going to happen. It&rsquo;s not our destiny.

<br><br>

However,
the Earth will be going through some transitions because we will be
crossing the galactic plane and the galactic plane has an intense
magnetic gravitational field. There will be changes. It&rsquo;s
inevitable. Mr. Green touched on some of that yesterday and others
have talked about this as well.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
going to happen, so you need to start thinking about: <I>Where
do I really want to be?</I>
Okay, if it&rsquo;s here, fine, make the best of it, but create your
space of independence. Don&rsquo;t take it for granted any longer. We
can&rsquo;t.

<br><br>

The
whole world is looking at us. The Asians, the Europeans -- they can&rsquo;t
believe how stupid we are. [laughter] Gospel! They can&rsquo;t
believe how stupid we are! They're like: <I>What&rsquo;s
wrong with the Americans?</I>
You know?

<br><br>

I
don&rsquo;t have an answer. Do you? [inaudible audience comment] You
watch TV! [laughs].
<br><br>

What
I&rsquo;d like to do, because I do have some extra time, is I would
really love to entertain some questions, if that&rsquo;s all right.
[applause] Easy ones! [laughs]
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Thank you, Alex. This is excellent, and I want to address the
mentoring suggestion because I think it&rsquo;s actually fascinating.
I think that this is coming directly from the Andromedans that you&rsquo;ve
been in contact with.
<br><br>

AC:
 Yes, it is.
<br><br>

KC:
 Mentoring is an interesting way of putting it. Okay? If you mentor
somebody, you do not rule them. You do not <I>tell</I>
them what to do. That&rsquo;s key.

<br><br>

Nobody
here&rsquo;s even suggested this; I think it&rsquo;s fascinating. So
what we have here is the notion that you can be in contact with
beings that can help teach you. Now, this is going on. This is going
on. I&rsquo;m aware of it. Camelot is aware of it. By God, we
wouldn&rsquo;t be here today if it wasn&rsquo;t for that.
<br><br>

There
is mentoring going on, but you do have to <I>ask</I>
for that to happen, and you have to be as fully conscious in the
process and as responsible and have that ability. You cannot sit
there and ask them to do for you. It&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s
about.
<br><br>

So
I would love it if you would talk about that because you obviously
have been mentored, so who better to teach us: What does that look
like? How is the interaction with you?

<br><br>

Just
describe... and I know you have maybe talked to some degree. But in
your interactions, if you could discuss some of the ways they have
mentored you to this point.
<br><br>

AC:
 Okay. Know that my mentoring has gone on with times that I have
literally been kicking and screaming. The biggest portion of the
mentoring has really been: <I>Why
do I believe things and what it is that I believe?</I>


<br><br>

So
a lot of times the question will come; I will ask a question or I
will have a perspective and they will immediately come back and say:
<I>Well, why do you believe
that? What is your process of believing that that&rsquo;s true? </I>

<br><br>

For
example, religions. It was one of the biggest things that I had when
I was a kid, and it was an issue that my father brought up to me as
well when I told him about this.
<br><br>

We
have formed perceptions of reality that are not based in reality.
They&rsquo;re only based on perception.

<br><br>

Now,
in accepting that perception as reality, what we do is we reinforce
that illusion. And that&rsquo;s what we have done on Earth, is we
have reinforced the illusion about who we are. About our strengths,
about our power, about how we&rsquo;re supposed to live on the Earth.
About being stuck on the Earth, about how we are supposed to raise
our children. We have all bought into these perceptions.
<br><br>

The
hardest things were to really look at myself, and this is really
where the work is &ndash; it&rsquo;s always with yourself. The most
difficult work has probably been, for me, in the last five, six,
seven years.

<br><br>

Questions
like: <I>Well, who am I?</I>
They don&rsquo;t answer it. They don&rsquo;t say: <I>Well,
you&rsquo;re this and this and this, </I>but
what they do is they will guide. They have guided me to who it is
that I want to be.

<br><br>

First
was understanding that you are not just a physicality. That&rsquo;s
the first thing to grasp &ndash; you are not a physicality.

<br><br>

And
just like some of the speakers said yesterday &ndash; I believe it
was Mr. Green who talked about: there is a soul and it&rsquo;s 22
grams. I think they've measured that in body weight. That is really
who you are and connecting to who that person really is, what that
essence is all about, you begin to realize: <I>Oh
my God, I am not at all who I thought I was.</I>


<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
purposely being vague because I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to tell
you who I am other than to say that who I am here on Earth in this
lifetime, and the mistakes that I have made, on some level I knew
better not to make those mistakes. Okay? But we do. We do. We
experiment. We create.

<br><br>

As
far as the meaning of life, they would never tell me what that was
exactly. All they would say is: <I>You
are creating your own adventure.</I>
So again, the responsibility is on me.
<br><br>

As
far as mentoring &ndash; to want to talk and to speak &ndash; the
idea was to just keep it very, very simple. To just share their
perspectives and let the people do whatever they wanted with it. And
it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether anyone believes it or not. People
know truth, people know bullshit. Eventually it all comes to the
surface; it has to.

<br><br>

Because
all of you are just like me; you all know better, you know what&rsquo;s
real. It&rsquo;s just a question of detaching ourselves from our
addiction to physicality. And that&rsquo;s what it is now &ndash;
it&rsquo;s become an addiction because the focus is on the
physicality. We&rsquo;re not objective anymore.

<br><br>

As
a soul, when you have an out-of-body experience and you detach from
your physical form, you are completely objective. You have a
360-degree peripheral view and that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re
objective. You&rsquo;re not addicted. You&rsquo;re not stuck in the
body or addicted to the body.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
the part that they have been working on with me the most, is to
actually feel and know that essence of myself as much as possible.

<br><br>

So,
when we talk about mentoring, the mentoring is to get us from where
we are here to self-empowerment. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking
about.

<br><br>

Once
we have achieved self empowerment &ndash; and it won&rsquo;t take
long folks; it really won&rsquo;t take long &ndash; we will know
exactly what to do, because we are spiritual beings. We are eternal;
there is no age to us. And that&rsquo;s not a metaphysical blind.
That is a reality.

<br><br>

So,
the mentoring is to help us move out of our addiction to physicality
into full power as spiritual beings. And it isn&rsquo;t full of
dogma; it isn&rsquo;t any of that. It&rsquo;s all about
introspection, voluntary introspection. That&rsquo;s what it is.
<br><br>

KC:
 Thank you. Thank you.

<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #1 (AM1):  Hi, Mr. Collier. Thanks for being here today. I
wanted to ask you something about something you mentioned in your
interview before. You mentioned that an ancient race called the <I>Paa
Tal</I> created human
beings, probably so long ago; I wondered if you could just elaborate
on that, because I always wondered about it ever since you said it.
Thanks.

<br><br>

AC:
 It is believed that an ancient race &ndash; some of them call them
<I>The Founders</I>,
other cultures call them the <I>Paa
Tal</I> &ndash; created not
only the wormholes, but created most of the physicality in what we
know as our universe. Because, as they travel, they are finding
civilizations and the ruins of civilizations far beyond anything that
even they know... and we&rsquo;re talking fifth, sixth, seventh,
eighth, ninth, tenth-density space travelers who are traveling not
only in, and moving in, our physicality and other physicalities, but
even their own.

<br><br>

The
wormholes is the best example that I&rsquo;ve been given. No one, no
advanced space race has any idea how they were actually built, but we
know that they exist. In fact, there are several that have snapped,
connecting our Galaxy to some of the other nearby Galaxies. They&rsquo;ve
snapped and no one knows how to fix them because we don&rsquo;t even
know how they were built.
<br><br>

AM
#2 (DAN):  I&rsquo;m Dan Bender, the one who&rsquo;s still working on
the streaming. I was asked by the streaming audience, which is now up
to 1,500 members currently watching &ndash; and I think we&rsquo;ve
probably have over 10,000 that tuned in on this particular segment.
[applause] Thank you. I&rsquo;ve kind of picked three quick
questions... hopefully, they&rsquo;re quick, that I was asked to pass
on. They&rsquo;re randomly chosen, so they may not be the best ones
we&rsquo;ve got out there, but what the heck?
<br><br>

One
of the first ones was: <I>What
free energy devices do you know about?</I>
<br><br>

AC:
 One I know is magnetic. Essentially, it was invented by a gentleman
in Tennessee. It was just a bit larger than a shoebox and it was
generated by magnetics. It had an engine inside of it and it spun.
Once you started it, it would power a home completely independent, no
matter where it was.

<br><br>

I
understand that the gentleman and the technology vanished about eight
years ago. He tried to get a patent on it and that&rsquo;s when he
basically went off the grid. He actually demonstrated that technology
and he began building that technology back in 1976.

<br><br>

DAN:
 The second question I have is: <I>Can
mentoring happen on the Internet?</I>


<br><br>

Now,
I have to admit, I wasn&rsquo;t completely paying attention to
everything because I was so busy with everything on the Internet, but
that&rsquo;s the question I have.
<br><br>

AC:
 I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s a great question. I don&rsquo;t
know. I wouldn&rsquo;t see why not.
<br><br>

DAN:
 Okay. I guess we have to figure it out &ndash; one of my little side
jobs I&rsquo;ve got to do. [laughter] Last question I have here so I
can let some of the other folks get back in here: <I>How
do you deal with the greed issue?  </I>

<br><br>

AC:
 I don&rsquo;t have an answer for that.

<br><br>

DAN:
 Okay.
<br><br>

AC:
 I mean, what is greed? That they&rsquo;ll never have enough? It&rsquo;s
basically grounded in fear, I would think. Fear of loss, fear of
abstinence, fear of not having enough, fear of loss. To me that&rsquo;s
what greed is. It&rsquo;s just a fear.

<br><br>

Can
it become an addiction? Apparently it has. [laughter] But I
personally don&rsquo;t have an answer for that.
<br><br>

DAN:
 Thank you from the Internet audience.
<br><br>

AC:
 Okay. Thank you. [applause]
<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #3 (AM3):  You mentioned about possible coming changes, like
on a geological level. To me it seems so chancy. I&rsquo;d appreciate
maybe your thoughts on: <I>Do
we just trust our intuition as far as where to go, what to do, how to
plan for something like that, or...?</I>
It seems a rather daunting thing to try to get your head around.
<br><br>

AC:
 Well, you know, change occurs all the time and you do things
intuitively all the time as well, whether you realize it or not. You
might change the way you go home one day and do something different,
and then when you get home, you find out that right where you would
have been, there was a horrific car crash. That, in fact, just
happened to my wife. She did something completely out of the
ordinary, for her, and she would have been <I>right
there</I>.

<br><br>

So,
you know, everybody has their guides; everybody has their own
intuition. I&rsquo;m not always the most intuitive at times, either.

<br><br>

The
only way I know to answer this is you just learn to trust yourself.
It could be that you&rsquo;ll be guided to go out of town when
something happens. I don&rsquo;t have that answer. Or you will be
right where you don&rsquo;t think you need to be, but you&rsquo;re
going to be there for a very, very good reason, and out of it will
come a self-empowerment that you never would have had before.

<br><br>

We
all have our own paths and we are all creating our own realities. We
all have our own personal agendas for learning and growing and
becoming who we are. Your experience is going to be very different
from mine. I don&rsquo;t know how, you know, to tell you.

<br><br>

I
mean, hey, if I had a hard date? But I never do. I don&rsquo;t get a
hard date and I&rsquo;ve made that mistake in the past about giving
hard dates, when in fact, they were probabilities.

<br><br>

So
the fact is, I don&rsquo;t know either, but you just have to trust
that you will be exactly where you need to be when you need to be
there. And I know that&rsquo;s kind of a foo-foo, la-di-dah answer,
but that&rsquo;s my own experience as well, you know? That I just
have to pray and have faith that I&rsquo;ll be exactly where I need
to be.
<br><br>

AM3:
 I appreciate that. That&rsquo;s pretty much my take on it and I just
wanted to kind of see where your thoughts were on that. Because to
try to take it from a mental perspective, and plan, and get out maps
and... seems a little absurd to me. So I go in the other direction,
trusting in the flow of life. So I appreciate that answer. Thank you.
<br><br>

AC:
 Exactly. And personally, I wrestle with that all the time. I try to
have backup plan to backup plan to backup plan to backup plan, and I
spend all this energy doing this and it goes in a completely in a
different direction. So... [laughs]
<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #4 (AM4):  How&rsquo;re you doing? Thank you for being here. I
just have a question. When you mentioned the thing about the 47
levels of government...
<br><br>

AC:
 Levels of security clearance.
<br><br>

AM4:
 Yeah, security, that the President doesn&rsquo;t even know, that
he&rsquo;s not really in charge. This happened 46 years ago, of
course, but I was just wondering what are your thoughts on the
purpose of President Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination? I just was
curious about that, you know, just wondering.

<br><br>

AC:
 [audience response/inaudible comments] No, no. Don&rsquo;t be sorry!
Don&rsquo;t be sorry. I just... oooh man!

<br><br>

Okay.
I will tell you my perspective on that. [takes deep breath]
Eisenhower told Kennedy about &rsquo;54 [Ed note: That&rsquo;s when
Eisenhower met with ETs at Muroc AFB &ndash; now Edwards AFB &ndash;
and this was a key meeting of the negative ETs that misled the US
government, leading it down into the rabbit-hole trap that it now
finds itself in, being unable, so far, to proceed forward with the
ET/UFO Disclosure.], so Kennedy knew and he told Bobby, obviously.

<br><br>

One
of the things that happened &ndash; and this has been documented
through the great work that Dr. Steven Greer has done with the
Disclosure Project &ndash; is that most of the extraterrestrial
knowledge and technology and exchange of technology went black three
weeks after Eisenhower knew about it. So he didn&rsquo;t
even know where it was, and this has been confirmed by one of his
Chief of Staff, Brigadier
General Langdon, I believe it is.

<br><br>

[Ed
note: <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Adams" target="_blank">Sherman
Adams</A>
was Eisenhower&rsquo;s Chief of Staff; a search of the military&rsquo;s
Joint Chiefs of Staff proved fruitless for &ldquo;Brigadier
General Langdon.&rdquo;]
<br><br>

So,
he shared all this with John Kennedy and apparently where they felt
the hub of the loss of where this technology had gone, and how far it
went black, was something called the Special Operations Coordinating
Group, which was part of the National Security Council.

<br><br>

What&lsquo;s
interesting to note is that the first thing John Kennedy did when he
took office was sign a presidential directive abolishing the Special
Operations Coordinating Group.

<br><br>

Now,
no one knows exactly who they are, but they&rsquo;re not only
connected to the intelligence, but also to all the black programs, to
the secret space program and everything else. There is some
conjecture that these people are the governors of the Federal
Reserve, because they control the money, and it&rsquo;s really all
about the money. That&rsquo;s conjecture though. I don&rsquo;t know
for a fact.

<br><br>

But,
what&rsquo;s interesting to note is that they had connections
everywhere, to everything, because all the intelligence from above
would come to them and then they would decide which information the
President was supposed to get. Again, those layers of security
clearances.
<br><br>

What&rsquo;s
interesting to note is: after the assassination, the very first thing
Johnson did when he got back into the White House was recreate the
Special Operations Coordinating Group, now known as Special Group in
the National Security Council.

<br><br>

That&rsquo;s
my take on it.

<br><br>

AM4:
 That&rsquo;s awesome. But, that time during The Sixties... of
course, as you know, like four more -- are they all just, like, a
series of random events, or all they all different... like, you know,
King, and Bobby? Are they just all random occurrences of lone nuts
like James Earl Ray and all those guys, and Sirhan Sirhan, or are
they just a part of that whole thing?

<br><br>

AC:
 I think that there are programs that overlap all the actions that
occur in each country. Yes, there are some lone nuts or individuals
that do things, but there&rsquo;s also, at the same time, an
overwhelming amount of evidence that many people have been
brainwashed and created to be hitters, to &ldquo;go wet&rdquo; and
take out people. So, I don&rsquo;t know.

<br><br>

But
again, you know, let&rsquo;s go back to Operation Paperclip. A lot of
the brainwashing and mind control technology that the Germans had
been given was brought over here and they just continued operating
here under different names with new passports. So it&rsquo;s very a
big... and I don&rsquo;t know all the components.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
a very big question, but on the surface, does it look like it was
done on purpose? I mean, look at the individuals, who they were. They
were making change. They were creating an awareness; they were the
focal point of a very powerful movement for change, to make things
happen for the betterment of everybody. Okay?

<br><br>

Again,
that is the pyramidal power structure. You lop off the head &ndash;
loss of knowledge; it flounders. Somebody can come in and take
control and move it the other way, then it doesn&rsquo;t exist. So...
okay?

<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #5 (AM5):  Hello, Sir. Thank you for being here.

<br><br>

AC:
 You&rsquo;re welcome.
<br><br>

AM5:
 First I wanted to thank you for bringing up a subject that I feel is
one of the most important things that we can talk about here at this
conference. As far as I can tell, you are the first person to bring
it up &ndash; it&rsquo;s the monetary system, the economic system
that we predominantly use in this world.

<br><br>

My
question is if you and/or the Andromedans have any insight to offer
as far as the transition that we&rsquo;ll need in order to transcend
an economic system that posits us in a position of feeling like we
need to compete with each other in order to survive, making us feel
separated from each other instead of being one.

<br><br>

AC:
 That&rsquo;s a great question. And let me ask you this back: What
are your thoughts on it first? [laughter]

<br><br>

AM5:
 Obviously, you can tell by how I worded my question...
<br><br>

AC:
 Mentoring is about self-empowerment, okay?
<br><br>

AM5:
 That&rsquo;s right.
<br><br>

AC:
 What are your ideas on it first? You know, it&rsquo;s great to ask
somebody for their advice when you don&rsquo;t have a clue what you
want to do, but that can wrongly, or to your betterment, influence
you. But it&rsquo;s better for you to have some idea about where you
stand and why you stand on a particular position or a reason to make
a change than to have somebody tell you why. [applause] And that&rsquo;s
what they want. They want us to come half way.
<br><br>

AM5:
 I very much agree with that point, as a matter of fact, and I do
have a lot of my own opinions regarding how we can do it. I just felt
that it was an important subject to bring back up.

<br><br>

I
feel that personally it goes back to something that you said
regarding the creation of something that doesn&rsquo;t already exist
in the world and never has before. I feel that that&rsquo;s what we
need, in the form of human interaction.
<br><br>

AC:
 We can do this. I mean, as souls when we&rsquo;re not here on Earth,
we&rsquo;ve been in other civilizations that don&rsquo;t have a
monetary system. We have this knowledge within us. We do know. We
just don&rsquo;t have access to it at the moment, but we do know, all
of us.

<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #6 (AM6):  Thank you very much for being here. I&rsquo;m very
inspired by your message.

<br><br>

AC:
 It&rsquo;s an honor for me.
<br><br>

AM6:
 Thank you, and for us, too. My question to you is, you spoke earlier
about the whole thing of the <I>Domain
of Knowing</I> and, you know,
the intention that we have together, and how at one point there was
not this whole human rights. So, how can we come together as a group,
collectively, in creating an intention for the world that we want to
see?

<br><br>

How
can we... You know, all of us are asking: <I>What
can we do?</I> What can we
all do to collectively share our intentions of the world that we want
to see, the world that we want to create?

<br><br>

They
have their intention, but perhaps we need to collectively have ours
and align together about the world we envision. I&rsquo;m wondering
if you have any advice or counsel or mentorship about how we can
unite in that way and gather our intentions to create the world we
know to be true in our hearts, we know is possible for us to live in;
that we remember.
<br><br>

AC:
 That&rsquo;s the first step. Just talking with your friends, people
of like mind. Just creating that vortex of knowledge, of harmonic, of
frequency, and as you begin to talk more and more about it, your
group grows.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ll
give you an example, the best example that comes to mind is: in
Colorado there were a group of women who were the wives of soldiers
over in Iraq.

<br><br>

What
they did was, they formed something called the <I>Kitchen
Militia</I> &ndash; okay? &ndash;
where they would all get together, not only share recipes and about
rearing children, yadda, yadda, yadda, and sharing information and
letters about their spouses overseas, but they would also start
talking about different ideas.

<br><br>

Some
incredible ideas came out of the Kitchen Militia. Several of them
even started companies of ideas that came out and now they&rsquo;re
employing many of the people <I>within</I>
the Kitchen Militia.

<br><br>

So,
it&rsquo;s very simple steps. And again, individually, this has to be
at grassroots. All it takes is a focus, a turn of our focus away from
the drama and the crap that they want us to focus on, on the news and
CNN, etcetera, and start thinking about: What is it that I want?

<br><br>

What
information do I want to know? What do I want to hear? What
information do I want to hear on the news? What kind of neighborhood
do I want to live in? What do I want to talk to my friends about?
What&rsquo;s really important to me?

<br><br>

And
Ladies and Gentlemen, back in 1993, I was telling everybody to throw
their televisions away. I really was. You know, I told you so, okay?
[laughter]

<br><br>

I
mean, we have one and we just watch movies and we choose which movies
we want. I do have rabbit ears, so that I can watch the election to
find out who&rsquo;s going to screw us for the next four years
[laughter] and that&rsquo;s roughly it. And the Super Bowl, but now I
can get that online, so now I don&rsquo;t even have to plug in the
rabbit ears.

<br><br>

So,
you know... you guys know this stuff. You know this stuff. You just
have to want it, you just have to want it. You've got to want it so
bad that you&rsquo;re willing to just do it and say: <I>Enough
is enough!</I>

<br><br>

You
do that with your kids. You do that with your neighbors. You do that
with your bosses. Now you've got to do it about your life.

<br><br>

What
is it that you really want? Get some clear, distinct ideas about what
it is   you really want. Because the system we have now is crumbling
and it&rsquo;s going to continue to crumble. All the illusion in the
world is not going to keep it standing because it&rsquo;s run its
course. It&rsquo;s done.

<br><br>

So,
we have to create something else. We have to, because if we don&rsquo;t,
the Powers That Be will create it for us, and I <I>guarantee</I>
you, you will not be free. You won&rsquo;t be free. You won&rsquo;t
like it at all. [laughter] You won&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s a given, an
absolute given, because it&rsquo;s all about them. It&rsquo;s not
about you. And as Spock once said: <I>The
needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.</I>
<br><br>

Next
question?
<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #7 (DAVE):  Alex, my name is Dave
Farman. I represent
ALIENSHIFT -- <U><A HREF="https://www.alienshift.com/" target="_blank">www.alienshift.com</A></U>
. The page we made for you is between 200 and 250 pages. It&rsquo;s
one of the most visited. ALIENSHIFT is about new hope for humanity
and you are one of the... we could call you the new hope for
humanity. I want to thank you for all the stuff you&rsquo;ve done.
Basically my question is... I&rsquo;m sorry. You want to say
something?
<br><br>

AC:
 It&rsquo;s not about me. It&rsquo;s not about me.
<br><br>

DAVE:
It&rsquo;s all about us, and the question I have is about us, the
public. Every UFOlogist, the past 30 years I&rsquo;ve been watching,
they write books and videos and they go home. There is no unity;
there is no group that can... How can we create such a 40-man
international group that would have a leader like you, for instance,
or whoever else would want to take the position, and we have our
voice with the ET and with the people of the Earth?

<br><br>

[to
the audience] You guys are all waiting for governments. Don&rsquo;t
do that! Don&rsquo;t do that. We <I>are</I>
the governments between humanity and the ET. Do not wait for any
governments to help you guys. [Alex initiates applause]

<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #8 (AM8):  Hi. Thanks for coming today. We all appreciate
that. I guess a question I have is, I kind of have a profound
question, or somewhat profound, I guess, which is to say that, on the
one hand, I think that we all want to access knowledge and we want to
know what&rsquo;s going on, and that&rsquo;s empowering.

<br><br>

On
the other hand, it is also true that the more we know, to a certain
extent the more of a target we become. I think that that is just
because of the fact... especially the way that we&rsquo;ve had a lot
of laws that have been passed throughout the world to monitor what
people are doing. I think we all have to be cognizant of that.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;m
asking, what do you think? How can we access...? We know that there&rsquo;s
powers that are off-planet. We know that the major self or the Higher
Self is one of purity and strength. How do we access that in the face
of the fact that we do put ourselves &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know if
it&rsquo;s <I>at risk</I>
&ndash; but that we put ourselves in somewhat of a precarious
position and that we&rsquo;re facing a very, very organized and very
strong union across the planet.

<br><br>

And
how do we get there? How do we empower ourselves? I guess that&rsquo;s
what I want to ask.

<br><br>

AC:
 Okay. Let&rsquo;s deal with the first of these. I want you to do me
a favor just for a moment. I want you to get down on your knees. Give
him the mike. Just get down on your knees. Okay? I want you to get
down on your knees. Yeah, just like that. Look at me. I want you to
look at me. Can you look at me?
<br><br>

AM8:
 It&rsquo;s not what I was expecting, but...
<br><br>

AC:
 Do you want to live the rest of your life like that?

<br><br>

AM8:
 No, not particularly. No.
<br><br>

AC:
 Okay, then stand up. [applause; whistles] Then stand up!

<br><br>

Dude,
you&rsquo;re [an] eternal soul. All they can do is take this [the
body] away from you and you still live. Okay? It&rsquo;s not who we
are -- it&rsquo;s <I>what</I>
we are.

<br><br>

As
far as forming an organization, it needs to be grassroots because
everything else that becomes a foundation or a corporation, they take
over. If it&rsquo;s grassroots and everybody in this audience and
every citizen around the world &ndash; if we start watching each
others&rsquo; back, there isn&rsquo;t <I>jack</I>
that they can do to us. [applause; shouts; whistles] There just
isn&rsquo;t.
<br><br>

AM8:
 I hear you. I hear you. Okay. That was dramatic. Thanks.
<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #9 (AM9):  I got up because I wanted to assert that we are the
Ground Crew and that we are being mentored, and find out if you
disagree with that, that this is the choir and that we are being
mentored already whether we&rsquo;ve been tapped on the shoulder by
someone from another part of the Galaxy or not. That we should stop
denying that we&rsquo;re already being mentored and we already are
getting the message of what it is that we need to do.
<br><br>

AC:
 Well, I think George said it best yesterday, Mr. Green: <I>We
are extraterrestrials.</I>
You know? [laughs] We&rsquo;re just trying to reconnect to kin,
basically. So yeah, you&rsquo;re absolutely right. I don&rsquo;t have
any problem with that.

<br><br>

My
purpose for reiterating it is knowing that these things go wherever
they go and that there are so many people now coming into this,
discovering it for the first time or at least asking questions, and
it&rsquo;s important to bring them on board as quickly as possible.
To just have them, to plant the seed.

<br><br>

Hey,
on some level you are already being mentored, spiritually, and we
just need to bring the physicality and connect that to the spiritual
lessons of ourselves.
<br><br>

AM9:
 Thank you. Great.
<br><br>

AC:
 That was my purpose.
<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER#10 (AM10):  I was just wondering about the nature of the
incoming object.

<br><br>

AC:
 What was the question?
<br><br>

AM10:
 Sorry, I&rsquo;m a little nervous here.
<br><br>

AC:
 Nobody will bite you. [laughter]
<br><br>

AM10:
 Yeah. You mentioned an incoming object, 22 degrees to Uranus or
something.
<br><br>

AC:
Eighteen degrees right ascension of Neptune&rsquo;s orbit. All I know
is that it&rsquo;s a planetary structure and it&rsquo;s friendly. I
don&rsquo;t know anything more about it at the moment, but I know
it&rsquo;s friendly. Okay? It&rsquo;s not Nibiru.

<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #11 (AM11):  I have a question but as I was standing there I
had a realization. You were talking about the holographic kind of
system that they&rsquo;ve put in place and that you said that we need
to implement that holographic system. When you said we need to become
grassroots, everything has to become grassroots, I <I>got
it</I> on an extreme level
that, by continuing to share passionately with absolutely everyone,
that we are creating the holographic system that they can&rsquo;t
destroy.
<br><br>

AC:
 That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s impossible.
<br><br>

AM11:
 I really got it. Thank you.
<br><br>

AC:
 You&rsquo;re very welcome.
<br><br>

AM11:
 My question is, you were mentioning that the Andromeda have the DNA
to be able to remember past lives and that our DNA is damaged so we
cannot. Do you know of ways in which we can heal our DNA? And would
accessing the blueprint of perfect health and healing in our Higher
Self be part of that?
<br><br>

AC:
 It&rsquo;s a great question. I don&rsquo;t have the answer to that.
<br><br>

AM11:
 Thank you.
<br><br>

AC:
 ...and I had to put my glasses on to see who I was talking to.
[laughs]
<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #12 (AM12):  Okay, my take on the grassroots thing, and tell
me if I&rsquo;m right, is that even if we&rsquo;re not out talking,
if you&rsquo;re doing your spiritual work and in your mind you have a
desire for a world that&rsquo;s peaceful and pure and good without
the hatefulness and the fear, and you&rsquo;re creating that, that
<I>that&rsquo;s the
grassroots thing</I>; that it
doesn&rsquo;t have to be an organization.
<br><br>

AC:
 That&rsquo;s exactly right.

<br><br>

AM12:
 Thank you.
<br><br>

AC:
 You got it. [applause]
<br><br>

Now,
I wanted to bring up something. I&rsquo;ve been blessed to have an
opportunity to spend some time in Europe, and I was in Switzerland.
We had just come out of a pub and there were some young men being
arrested for some reason &ndash; and I will never forget this.

<br><br>

As
we&rsquo;re standing there watching this happen, one of the young men
said to the Swiss police: <I>You
didn&rsquo;t read me my rights.</I>


<br><br>

And
the cop stopped and goes: <I>What
rights?</I>

<br><br>

He
goes: <I>I got rights. You
got to read me the Miranda Act.</I>
And this was a Swiss student. Okay?
<br><br>

And
he goes: <I>This is
Switzerland. You don&rsquo;t have any rights here.</I>


<br><br>

Okay?
But this young man believed so much in that that he was willing to
challenge the police officer about it &ndash; okay? &ndash; and it
was a big surprise for him.

<br><br>

So,
you see, the influence that the United States has had on the world is
so [much] more profound than any of us realize and the disappointment
is probably equal to that at this point &ndash; okay? -- because here
the propaganda has been communism, fascism. We have sent young men to
war, lost their lives to fight communism and fascism, and in 60
years, we become fascist? What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?

<br><br>

[to
audience] Sir? Two more questions and then I&rsquo;m done.
<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #13 (AM13):  I wanted to preface this question with just
saying again, as I spoke with you in private; it&rsquo;s an honor and
a privilege to have you here with us, and thank you for speaking of
what you know. I also wanted to say that I don&rsquo;t want this
question to sound in any way hostile to anyone, because it does come
from the bottom of my heart [getting emotional] and it&rsquo;s
something that has been bothering me for a long time.

<br><br>

If
we are to move forward and connect all the pieces of the puzzle, and
move forward into the holographic social structure that you&rsquo;re
talking about, where the children know more than the adults and where
all information is given to the young, then why is it that we still &ndash;
even in Disclosure movements and with courageous witness testimony
coming forward, people speaking &ndash; that there are still certain
topics that people are afraid to or will resist talking about, such
as the stargates that was mentioned earlier this morning, and other
things?

<br><br>

AC:
 So, is your question, exactly, why there are still some topics
people don&rsquo;t want to discuss?
<br><br>

AM13:
 Right. In people who are courageously stepping forward and risking
their lives to speak out about what they know, why is it that they do
not speak about everything that they do know and there are still
topics that they do not wish to speak about?
<br><br>

AC:
 Well, that&rsquo;s a great question and I am also guilty of that.
It&rsquo;s a comfort zone. It&rsquo;s a comfort level and everything
has its own timing.

<br><br>

What
would happen to humanity if the government were to come clean about
everything that they know about everything that they know? Could
humanity totally deal with it? Probably a portion of humanity could
deal with it.

<br><br>

The
other portion, or portions, or groups, could not maybe deal with it
at least in the very beginning, because they have constructed a
reality around themselves that is based on perception that is an
illusion. To shatter that all in one fell swoop can be a disservice
to them.

<br><br>

The
idea is to take people and give them the tools that they need so that
they voluntarily begin the process of self-responsibility and
voluntary introspection. The information is there and it&rsquo;s been
out there for 50, 60 years.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;ll
take the UFO community as a whole, Exopolitics. More and more people
are coming into this. Who is the biggest group now? It&rsquo;s the
young people, which is promising. They are in fact influencing their
parents by having discussions at home: What do you think about this,
what do you think about that? So it doesn&rsquo;t matter how it
happens as long as it happens.

<br><br>

Now,
I mentioned Dulce in our conversation earlier. There will be people,
I&rsquo;m sure, who will contact these two
[Ed. note: referring
to speakers Duncan O&rsquo;Finioan and David Corso whose
presentations preceded this one.]
to really want to talk about that, and they&rsquo;re going to have to
be very careful about how they present the information, because the
things that happened there are horrific &ndash; absolutely horrific &ndash;
and they had to be dealt with and they were dealt with.

<br><br>

However,
that element that was behind those atrocities still exists here.
Okay? And even I don&rsquo;t want to talk about that because it
involved women and children. And that&rsquo;s as far as I&rsquo;ll
go.

<br><br>

But
now that I&rsquo;ve mentioned it, I&rsquo;ve created a <I>Domain
of Knowing</I>, okay? I&rsquo;ve
just created a <I>Domain of
Knowing</I>. Now each of you
will start going out, thinking about that, doing some research to
pull that information to you because now you want to know.

<br><br>

AM13:
 Thank you very much.
<br><br>

AC:
 You&rsquo;re welcome. Last two questions.
<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #14 (AM14):  My question was actually about children and the
disappearance of children, if you&rsquo;re willing to talk about it.
<br><br>

AC:
 [sighs] I&rsquo;ve said so much about that already. I know that I
have been blasted about that. Ladies and Gentlemen, I absolutely know
what I know about the missing children and I&rsquo;m not going to
apologize for it. I stand by what I said all those years ago and I
stand by it today.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. Could you summarize? Because we&rsquo;re aware of this as
well, so if you could just... in maybe one sentence?
<br><br>

AC:
 [sighs] ... [long pause, whispers &ldquo;shit!&rdquo;] ... We have
become a natural resource, very much how we use cows and other
animals. We ourselves have become a natural resource. The younger
ones are the most desirable because they&rsquo;re not tainted with
chemical poisons in their bodies; because they&rsquo;re young. That&rsquo;s
all I&rsquo;m going to say.

<br><br>

KC:
 Laura Knight-Jadczyk
has gone into this in depth and Rich Dolan has also written a review
of her book that&rsquo;s very positive and Rich has... and Alfred
Webre published an article about the subject. So, if you want to
investigate it further...

<br><br>

Because,
actually, I just want to augment what Alex is saying here in the
sense that the point is not to give you everything out on a platter &ndash;
okay? &ndash; for you to understand what&rsquo;s going on. The point
is to give you direction.
<br><br>

What
Alex is doing here is mentoring you; he&rsquo;s giving you
indications. And that&rsquo;s what our whistleblowers do, by the way.
They don&rsquo;t tell you everything. They don&rsquo;t even tell us
everything. But they give us the clues that we need to do the
research necessary to find out the truth. And when you hit the truth,
it gets you. You can tell. You <I>know</I>
it.

<br><br>

You
want to be in denial, go right ahead. It&rsquo;s out there. The truth
is out there. It is <I>unbelievably</I>
out there! [applause]
<br><br>

AUDIENCE
MEMBER #15 (AM15):  Hi, Alex. I&rsquo;m the last question, obviously.
My name is Andreas. Please don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way, but I
love you, man! [laughter; applause]

<br><br>

My
actual question is actually directed to the audience and to you. I
was wondering if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind conducting a little
mini-meditation for all of us, to direct our intention to change the
future that we want to have. I was wondering if you would like to do
that. Thank you. [applause]
<br><br>

AC:
 Ooo... I&rsquo;m on the spot! [laughs] Well, this&rsquo;ll be a
first.

<br><br>

I
have an affinity for very simple common-sense spirituality which has
always lead me to the Native Americans. So what I will do is, I will
close this with a Native American prayer, and that just happens to be
the same prayer that&rsquo;s on the front page here that I have with
me.

<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
usually always the prayer that I go to. I change the words and make
them my own after all these years, but for the purposes of this, it
says exactly what I would want to say.
