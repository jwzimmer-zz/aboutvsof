KERRY
CASSIDY (KC):  I&rsquo;m Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot. I&rsquo;m
here with Miriam Delicado, and we are absolutely overjoyed to see
Miriam alive and looking so well after her auto accident. She is
doing this as a follow-up interview because she has some things to
say about the times we&rsquo;re in, and what people need to be
mindful of. So, go ahead, Miriam.
<br><br>

MIRIAM
DELICADO (MD):  Thank you, Kerry. I just want to make a little note
to say thank you to everyone for all of their support since this car
accident. I&rsquo;m recovering very quickly as a result of all this
healing energy that&rsquo;s being shared.
<br><br>

In
fact, that sort of leads me in to one of the things that I wanted to
talk about today with everyone, and that is how we really need to
step things up. We need to step things up as a community. We need to
step things up in unity and make our voices a lot stronger than they
have been.
<br><br>

It&rsquo;s
very clear to me how this network of people that are working in this
<I>light</I>
in order to educate, in order to inform and in order to bring about
change for humanity and the Earth [that] are really connected to one
another.

<br><br>

I&rsquo;ve
had so many people through this accident communicate with me, and the
way that they&rsquo;re hearing about it and the channels that they&rsquo;re
hearing about it is fantastic. So, it&rsquo;s a really positive part
of this that I have learned very, very clearly.
<br><br>

And
in saying that, I know that this particular time that we&rsquo;re in
is very delicate, and it is truly the <I>Time
of Choice</I>.
I&rsquo;ve been talking about this <I>Time
of Choice</I>
almost since I became public. But we are fully moving into a time
where difficulties are starting to arise for individuals,
communities, families, and we need to pay closer attention to what it
is that we, as the individuals, are doing.
<br><br>

Every
day of your life, you have choices, and I&rsquo;ve talked about this
with you in the past. But <I>this</I>
choice has to do with how well you are going to form the bonds
between the people in your life and people in your community.
<I>Community</I>
means this community of Lightworkers, people that are working to
educate.
<br><br>

What
steps are you going to take in order to bring about Disclosure of
this very, very important subject matter? And not only in the area of
UFOs, and ETs, and aliens, and all of these things, but, really,
Disclosure of what is happening in our world right now and what is
going to happen.

<br><br>

<I>What
is it that the scientists actually know? What is it that the
philosophers have known for a very long time? And what is it that the
indigenous people have known and do know at this very time?</I>
<br><br>

This
point of Disclosure that I&rsquo;m talking about is coming. It needs
to come from all directions, and that includes the individual.

<br><br>

So,
if you have a story to tell, it&rsquo;s time to start sharing it,
because, if you continue to remain silent, then we as a people are
not going to be able to move forward. We are not going to be able to
overcome any great difficulties that may be challenging us in the
future.
<br><br>

I
know -- and have known for 21 years -- that this particular time that
we&rsquo;re in right now... I call it a <I>Time
of Insanity</I>,
when people are completely losing their rational selves.
<br><br>

We
need to be very, very careful of whom we align ourselves with, whom
we form friendships with, whom we associate with. Even for someone as
connected and in sync as I am, I have still had situations in the
past year and the last six months where I&rsquo;ve allowed people to
come into my life who were very destructive and harmful.
<br><br>

So
this is something that was shared with me a very long time ago by the
Tall Blondes. They have restated to me numerous times in the past
year to be very aware of my surroundings, aware of whom I am
associating with, and that I needed to not be distracted.
<br><br>

These
people are coming into our lives to distract us from speaking, from
telling our stories, from being strong in our communities, from being
the change &ndash; and that means anything from writing your
Congressman to say, <I>I
want Disclosure</I>,
to creating a community garden and collecting heritage seeds &ndash;
which, by the way, is going to become more and more and more
difficult.

<br><br>

I
have continually talked to people about collecting their heritage and
heirloom seeds. I&rsquo;m telling you that, if you don&rsquo;t have
your seeds today, it is almost too late, because new laws are being
formed all over the planet &ndash; and that includes all over in
North America &ndash; where legislation is being brought in for
organic farming to be almost, you know, illegal; collecting of seeds,
illegal. And maybe the next step is the <I>owning</I>
of heritage seeds.

<br><br>

So,
if we as a community do not take a stand as one voice and one people
for one Earth, we may as well just sit back, relax, and wait for the
end. No longer can anyone turn around and say that they can be
complacent about anything. And I mean <I>anything</I>
that&rsquo;s going on right now.
<br><br>

Different
organizations, different groups around the world know what&rsquo;s
coming. They&rsquo;re making preparations for it. Pay attention. Open
your eyes. Look at the news. Is it telling you anything? No. It&rsquo;s
talking about gossip. Dig deeper and <I>look</I>
at what it is that&rsquo;s happening with seed banks around the
world, with where the money&rsquo;s flowing, who&rsquo;s in control
of our finances and how that money is being distributed.
<br><br>

And
let&rsquo;s think about this: <I>How
much money has gone missing with governments, not only in North
America, South America, but around the globe? Where is that money
being funneled into?</I>


<br><br>

Pay
attention. Pay attention to these things, because they&rsquo;re going
to be keys to be able to lead you to some very, very serious answers.
<br><br>

Now,
I strongly suggest you have your seeds [and] that you have your
preparations; that you connect with those that you need to connect
with because, if something horrible does happen in your community or
in your area, you will be fine. You can have peace in your heart,
knowing that you have already made steps to communicate and to open
your heart to your neighbor.
<br><br>

Really,
this isn&rsquo;t about digging bunkers and, you know, going and
hiding from the world. This is really about opening yourself up to
the world and to what it is that&rsquo;s coming.
<br><br>

So
this is a really strong message, to not be blindsided by all of these
distractions that are around us right now.

<br><br>

This
time of... I call it the <I>Time
of Insanity</I>
hitting us and what we&rsquo;re moving through... people, rational
people, are becoming irrational. Spiritual people are becoming
vicious and confused and vindictive.

<br><br>

And
on the flip side, people that were vindictive and this type of focus
in their lives of just materialism are completely flipping and
becoming spiritual. So pay attention to who you&rsquo;re associating
with.
<br><br>

If
you have an open heart, it&rsquo;s one of the ways of being able to
walk through this very difficult time. If you&rsquo;re completely
confused about the people around you, stop and meditate. It&rsquo;s
going to be able to bring your body, your mind, and your spirit back
into alignment of who you are and what your intended purpose is here
on Earth at this time.
<br><br>

Many
of the people that come to Project Camelot in particular are very
focused on details, scientific details and this type of thing. It&rsquo;s
great to have that, but at the very, very end of all of this science
is something that the indigenous people themselves understand &ndash;
and that is energy and how it actually works.

<br><br>

So,
always remember to remain in your heart through this process;
because, if you can&rsquo;t remain in your heart, then no matter how
much knowledge and information you have, it&rsquo;s not going to do
anything for you.

<br><br>

By
remaining in your heart, you&rsquo;re going to be connected to the
right people, you&rsquo;re going to make the right decisions and
choices, and you&rsquo;re most importantly going to bring about
change quickly and rapidly.
<br><br>

If
this community made the choice of any one particular matter, and that
is, for example, Disclosure, and every single person on Project
Camelot that ever entered into any one of those videos &ndash;
whether it be on the website, on YouTube, on different websites &ndash;
and said: O<I>kay,
I&rsquo;m going to take 20 minutes of my day and write a very quick
letter to my Congressman asking him or her to bring about Disclosure</I>,
the power of that one single step would be extraordinary.
<br><br>

Now,
there&rsquo;re a lot of issues that have been coming up for a number
of people over the course of the last year. One of the big questions
that people keep asking me about personally is swine flu, and
vaccines, and plagues, and what it is that&rsquo;s coming.

<br><br>

Listen,
the bottom line is that it is eventual -- it is not a question of <I>if</I>
-- it is a question of <I>when</I>
these things will take place. <I>Is
it going to take place in the next day?</I>
I don&rsquo;t know. <I>In
the next year?</I>
I don&rsquo;t know.

<br><br>

But
I can tell you this, that no matter what we choose to do, we must
remember that one of the greatest powers that we have is to remain in
balance with Nature and Mother Earth.
<br><br>

It
is not going to be through the sciences that we find the cure for an
illness that was derived from Nature. It is within ourselves that we
are going to be able to do that.
<br><br>

If
someone walked up to you and they walked out of a factory that&rsquo;s
had poison, and, you know, you saw all the signs, and there&rsquo;s
poison symbols everywhere, and they walk in with their plastic suits
and they walk back out, and they give you an apple, and they hold it
up to you, and you say: <I>Great!
I&rsquo;m hungry. Can I have that?</I>
Are you really going to eat that apple that walked out of a building
that is creating poison?
<br><br>

It
looks good and they&rsquo;re going to tell you it&rsquo;s good, but
it&rsquo;s up to you to decide whether or not it&rsquo;s actually
going to be right for you or not. No one&rsquo;s going to give you
the answer. You need to go inside.

<br><br>

If
you are meant to be here for the entire path of your life, then, you
know, until you&rsquo;re old and you&rsquo;re fortunate enough to
have those gray hairs move in, then that&rsquo;s great. And if you&rsquo;re
not, you could walk out of the house and get hit by a car like I did
a couple weeks ago. We never know truly what&rsquo;s going to happen
in our lives, no matter how connected you are.

<br><br>

So,
what you need to do is remain in your heart, and you need to remain
clear in that and know that the community that you&rsquo;re in, this
community in particular, is of Lightworkers, of scientists, of
philosophers, of seers, all of these different areas... of artists.
This community cares.

<br><br>

So
I&rsquo;m saying, take some action, because the next year that I&rsquo;m
telling you about is going to get worse. It&rsquo;s going to get more
difficult. There&rsquo;s going to be more financial problems. There&rsquo;s
going to be more difficulty for you to feed your families, for you to
buy new shoes for your children. And it&rsquo;s okay, because you
know what? We&rsquo;re all going through that.
<br><br>

The
way that we&rsquo;re going to be able to get through is to
communicate and have community with one another. And to work within
those structures that are not working for us &ndash; not to tear them
down and crush them, throw them away -- but to work with what we
currently have and just make our voices heard.

<br><br>

All
we need to do is make our voices heard. Write a letter, ask for
Disclosure, start asking questions, dig deeper, and start making some
action.
<br><br>

KC:
 Okay. I want to go to a different area, Miriam, and that was very
well said, by the way. I want to find out whether or not you want to
make any kind of statement about the need for indigenous people to
come forward at this time, because this is a great opportunity and
you don&rsquo;t know who might be watching.
<br><br>

MD:
 Thank you. Kerry, you know, we&rsquo;ve had numerous conversations
since we&rsquo;ve met and everyone out there knows that I have a very
close connection to indigenous people. The connection that I have is
from my heart; it&rsquo;s from my mind; it&rsquo;s actually from my
soul.

<br><br>

It
is <I>critical</I>,
it is critical that the indigenous cultures around the world come
together.

<br><br>

I
have a fear almost, and I don&rsquo;t say that often, but I do; I
have almost a shaking feeling with this that is of great concern,
because they&rsquo;re running around and I see it happening, they&rsquo;re
trying to make those connections, and bridge the gaps and bring the
voice, but there are so many people who are white people getting in
the way of that voice coming together.

<br><br>

Even
within indigenous communities and indigenous cultures, there is a lot
of ego involved. A lot of these cultures are talking about the
feminine being brought forward, and yet this is something that still
has not been fully accepted by them, themselves, even though they&rsquo;re
talking about it.
<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
running out of time on this Earth. We&rsquo;re running out of this
<I>Time
of Choice</I>.
We&rsquo;re still in it, and there is still hope, but the indigenous
cultures need to come together in the public eye, unified. This is
not going to happen from white people stepping forward and planning
and organizing. This is from the indigenous cultures themselves.

<br><br>

We
are going to be there to assist them in this change, to work
together, to bridge that gap between the balance of nature and what
it is that we have here in the structured world, what we&rsquo;ve
built.
<br><br>

We
need to come together. That means that on both sides we need to set
certain things aside and say that we no longer have the need for
this, and that these things do not have to completely change and
flip. You know, not everyone on Earth needs to go and live in the
jungle, and not everyone in the jungle needs to come out here and
live in this world.
<br><br>

But
what is it that both parties could learn from one another? That&rsquo;s
where the open heart needs to come in, even within the indigenous
cultures themselves.

<br><br>

Every
single day of my life in the past year and a half, almost two years,
has been focused on trying to bring that energy &ndash; these people
coming together. But, unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve experienced some
very, very, very dark, and I mean <I>dark</I>,
energies that have been coming forward through people to stop this
process from happening.

<br><br>

And
one of the things that I can say about the indigenous world is that
I&rsquo;m not easily fooled. So, when I hear someone say a word that
says <I>heart</I>,
I expect to feel it in mine; and, if I don&rsquo;t feel it in mine,
then I&rsquo;m not listening to what they&rsquo;re saying, because
they are speaking with a tongue that is a lie.
<br><br>

So,
the indigenous cultures need to come together, and they need to do it
quickly, because the situation on this Earth with disease, with
poverty, with starvation, with natural disasters, with political
structures, with economic structures -- all these things are being
broken down. They&rsquo;re crumbling, because they&rsquo;re not
working.
<br><br>

So,
if we don&rsquo;t step forward as the one voice, for one people, for
one world, we&rsquo;re not going to have one Earth left &ndash; not
with human beings on it.

<br><br>

This
isn&rsquo;t about saving humanity. It&rsquo;s not even about saving
the Earth. It&rsquo;s really about saving ourselves and making the
choice as far as what path we want to take.
<br><br>

So,
if anyone wants to begin building that bridge in order to create that
with the indigenous world, I&rsquo;m here, and I have friends. I have
contacts in different parts of the world who are also preparing to
make that happen.
<br><br>

KC:
 Yes, and Camelot is also here with our cameras, and with our team
that has joined us as of late, and we will go anywhere to film any
kinds of messages that those people want to put out there.

<br><br>

We&rsquo;re
standing right behind you in thinking that this is the time when we,
outside, in the outside world, would love to hear from the indigenous
people who have been sort of the guardians of the Earth for all these
years, for all the, you know, millions of years that humanity has
been occupying this lovely planet. And the time is now, and so I
second that.
<br><br>

MD:
 Well, what I would love to see happen, Kerry, is some of these
cultures that are trying to get their messages out to the world, to
really understand that they need to stop being distracted themselves.


<br><br>

Instead
of relying on one individual or one group, they really need to open
the doorway to any and all of them; instead of having people come and
just happen upon them, to just really say: O<I>kay,
I&rsquo;m here now. Come to me. I&rsquo;m ready to speak.  I&rsquo;m
ready to share</I>.
<br><br>

The
indigenous world has knowledge that the scientific world is just
beginning to understand. Great. I&rsquo;ve had understandings of the
universe and how it works and mathematics, and astrophysics, and so
forth, for years.

<br><br>

It
doesn&rsquo;t do anything, not until we begin to share that. And how
do you share it? You can only share it through your heart. You can
only share it when you become vocal and you begin to use those two
things in sync with one another to be able to bring about that
change.
<br><br>

We
have to start looking at the basics. We have to be able to start
looking at our families, our communities, our infrastructure, our
food, our environment. Basics. Look at them. What can you do, and
take action. There is absolutely no more time to be sitting on the
couch. You have to get up.
<br><br>

So,
I want to just say, let&rsquo;s move things forward and let&rsquo;s
get to work. And if there&rsquo;re any of you out there who are able
to assist in any way to bring these indigenous cultures together, I&rsquo;m
here. Project Camelot&rsquo;s here. There&rsquo;re a lot of other
people that are standing with us.

<br><br>

Let&rsquo;s
start making this happen, so that we can create what I&rsquo;ve
talked about from the beginning, which is a world gathering of
humanity.
<br><br>

KC:
 Thank you, Miriam. That&rsquo;s a lovely message. Why don&rsquo;t
you give your website, so that people can contact you and an email
address? And we&rsquo;ll also print it on the screen.
<br><br>

MD:
 My website address is <U><A HREF="https://www.alienbluestar.com/" target="_blank">www.alienbluestar.com</A></U>
and you can email me at <U><A HREF="mailto:miriam@alienbluestar.com">miriam@alienbluestar.com</A></U>
and I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing from all of you.
<br><br>

KC:
 Thank you very much.
