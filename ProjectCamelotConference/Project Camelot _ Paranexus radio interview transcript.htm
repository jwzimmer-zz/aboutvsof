It is Thursday, September            18, 2008. I&rsquo;m your host Doug Kelley here with my co-host, Grant Rubendunst.          Welcome, Grant.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Grant:&nbsp; Hey, welcome everybody. We&rsquo;re                    really excited to have Bill and Kerry with us from Project                    Camelot tonight. Yeah, and so, if you could, for the folks                    in the audience who might not be as familiar with your wonderful                    website and the great work you did, if you could just, maybe,                    perhaps start out by telling us how you guys got together                  and how this became such a passion for both of you.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kerry Cassidy:&nbsp; Basically,                  what happened was I was a frustrated writer.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Ryan:&nbsp; She just basically just picked up a consumer-grade                  camcorder and started talking to people, and I joined her just                  a little bit over two years ago. We realized we had the same                  vision. And to cut a very long story short, we&rsquo;ve had                  a very magical experience since then. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We&rsquo;ve                    had the experience, and forgive the metaphor, we just walk                    towards apparently blank walls and doors open to welcome                    us into an incredible wonderland of opportunity, talking                    to people who just a few short years ago when I was reading                    UFO books in my spare time, I was thinking: <em>You                  know what? I would give a </em>huge<em> amount of money to                  even being the same room with some of these people. </em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And here                    we are, we&rsquo;re very closely connected with a                  lot of them and we&rsquo;re privileged to be collecting information                  that starts to make sense of this great cobweb of secrecy which                  I was referring to just now. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we                    claim very little credit for anything that&rsquo;s                  happened. It seems to be happening around us. We&rsquo;re part                  of a larger team. There&rsquo;s a real&hellip; Pardon my mixed                  metaphors. There&rsquo;s a real snowball that&rsquo;s rolling. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Times <em>are</em> changing. The stories <em>are</em> coming                  out. We <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> been stopped in our work, which                  is very significant. Given that The Powers That Be have got                  the capability to squash us like a bug if they wanted to, they                  have not done that. And we think that that is significant.                  Because we do think the information we&rsquo;ve presented is                  valuable. And we&rsquo;re in a position to present some of                  that, depending on what you and your listeners would like to                  focus on, in the next couple of hours. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we&rsquo;re                    being <em>permitted</em> to do this. And we                  think that this may be helping The Powers That Be with the                  problem that they&rsquo;ve got, which is: How do they come                  clean with this huge pile of secrets that they&rsquo;re sitting                  on? For a whole variety of reasons, it&rsquo;s just got very,                  very, very complicated. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we started off just telling a few stories about ufo witnesses;                  and Bill Hamilton; Gary McKinnon, the so-called Pentagon hacker;                  a guy who we had contacted privately who was in an extraordinary                  situation 20 years ago of being an <em>archivist</em> of classified                  information, six months working in a vault with photographs                  and documents and artifacts and films. And he came forward                  to tell us what he had experienced. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we thought: <em>Wow,                      this is incredible. We&rsquo;ve got                    a couple of witnesses here who are willing to say something                    on record.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And since                    then we&rsquo;ve gone into time travel; we&rsquo;ve                  got into what&rsquo;s happening with a possible, potential,                  catastrophe that we feel has been averted years ahead. Then                  we got into issues connected with<em>: OK, what is gonna be                  happening in the next few years?</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s all very interesting, talking about Roswell and                  the kind of mess that Eisenhower, who was basically a good                  man, may have got himself into in the early 1950s. But there&rsquo;s                  a lot of historical information which is really interesting                  and not all that valuable unless we&rsquo;re still back in                  the so-called ufo dark ages when we&rsquo;re trying to prove                  that there&rsquo;s something going on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For us,                    this is self-evident, that there are so many things going                    on out there that aren&rsquo;t reported on CNN. We&rsquo;re                  taking this as our <em>starting</em> point, that we have visitors,                  that there are secrets, that the US military and the military                  of other countries are in this up their necks and beyond; that                  there are really complicated issues involving visits from future                  humans, time travel, time loops, stuff connected with the Montauk                  Project. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s very, very complicated, very interesting, very                  important. And we&rsquo;re living in critical times right now.                  And as Grant said, I think, <em>These are interesting times.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And one of the things that we find ourselves staring at almost                  in real time as we talk to you, is information coming at us                  about the kind of things that may be happening literally in                  the next few weeks. And all of these things are connected.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And with                    that, I&rsquo;ll step down from the podium from which                  I&rsquo;ve been talking [laughs], and allow you to steer this                  along, because there&rsquo;s so much to say.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; OK.                Grant, you have a question?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; One of the things I wanted to ask you, Bill, was&hellip; You                  know, on your website you talk about, kind of, your <em>thesis</em>.                  And I thought that was really fascinating. And I wonder if                  you could kind of enlighten our audience, if you could give                  them your perspective, kind of what you think, or an overview                  on what you think is happening and what the consequences might                  be.

And the reason why I say that                  is because these are complicated concepts, and it&rsquo;s almost                  the kind of thing that&rsquo;s easier to present with a diagram                  rather than on live radio. But here we go. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is                    what we are reasonably convinced has happened, and it&rsquo;s                    a sort of a variation of, and an enlargement on, what could                    be called conventional UFO understanding. So here we go.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Take                a breath.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; [laughs] <em>Very</em> deep breath. We are given                  to understand by two of our witnesses who did not know each                  other, independent-testing me, one of whom is Dan Burisch who                  is well-known to the UFO community, who we know well and who                  we are totally satisfied that his credentials are good will                  and very high connections; and another guy whose pseudonym,                  which we gave him, is Henry Deacon, who has worked on the inside                  for a large number of years. We know this guy very, very well. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, just as an aside on that, a couple of weeks ago we started                  a forum called the Project Avalon forum, not Project <em>Camelot</em>,                  but Project <em>Avalon</em>. The two are closely connected,                  and we&rsquo;ll talk about that a little bit, too. And Henry                  Deacon is very live on this forum. It&rsquo;s an almost unique                  situation where we&rsquo;ve got a black-ops whistleblower who&rsquo;s                  actually answering questions in real time on our forum. And                  we invite all our listeners to check into that. It&rsquo;s                  projectavalon.net. Click on the forum. Henry Deacon is right                  there.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, what these two witnesses say is that the Roswell visitors                  were future humans from a future Earth. They were not extra-<em>terrestrials</em>,                  they are extra-<em>temporals</em>. And they differ slightly                  in the time period which they believe they came from. Dan Burisch,                  from what I recall, says that he understands that they came                  from 24,000 years in the future. Henry Deacon says he thought                  it was more like 6,000 years in the future. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But those                    details are really unimportant, because this is such an important                    concept to get. And the thing is that this was not&hellip; This crash was a HUGE screw-up, if you&rsquo;ll                  excuse my French here, because it was not to have happened. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And one                    of the things that was retrieved from the crash was a small                    device which was a kind of&hellip; It was like a time                  portal, time guidance, time travel, instrument which is way                  beyond my capacity to describe in the English language.

They were tinkering around&hellip; As                    we are given to understand by both Burisch and Deacon, they                    were tinkering around with this high-tech device in such                  a way that it started to create loops and paradoxes in time. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And one of the issues that was prevalent there was that they                  discovered fairly early on, both from their own investigations                  using this device, and also from contact with future humans                  from a <em>different</em> era, even <em>further</em> into the                  future, is that in the future humans&rsquo; history, there                  was a major catastrophe in the year 2012 or around 2012. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is                    what the 2012 thing is all about. It&rsquo;s about                  an awareness that we have, and a historical record from the                  future humans&rsquo; point of view, that from <em>their</em> historical                  perspective, there was a major catastrophe that was a huge                  civilization wipeout. It was a pole shift. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what                    happened then&hellip; once again, to make this long                  story very short&hellip; is that the US military did what they                  do best and they started to dig in. They took defensive action                  and they started to spend trillions of dollars on a whole network                  of underground bases. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And interestingly                    enough, in the future humans&rsquo; history,                  this as exactly what was done. And after the catastrophe, half                  of the human race stayed underground, half of the human race                  left the planet, first to the Moon and Mars. They went off                  in different direction and evolved in slightly different ways.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, the reason for this pole shift, so we are given to understand,                  was that a certain kind of time-portal technology, which is                  known in the vernacular as <em>Looking-glasses</em>, manmade                  Looking-glasses and manmade <em>Stargates</em>, which both                  used the same kind of technology. <em>Stargates</em> you travel                  through. <em>Looking-glasses</em> you look through. And you                  can look into time and you can look into space. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And according                    to the future humans&rsquo; history, these devices                  amplified -- accidentally -- the effects of the Earth                  moving through a particular region of energetic space in and                  around the time of 2012. And this is what you read about all                  over the net &hellip; we&rsquo;ll have the Earth moving into                  an area where it&rsquo;s parallel with the plane of the&hellip; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Center                of the Galaxy.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; &hellip;the galaxy. Something to do with that. This                  isn&rsquo;t just complete hokum, although there&rsquo;s a lot                  of hokum talked about it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There&rsquo;s                    a region of energetic space that the solar system starts                    to move through, and <em>is</em> starting to move through,                  and in the future humans&rsquo; timeline, these manmade Looking-glass                  and Stargate devices amplified these energetic effects, which                  is something to do with micro-wormholes in space, and caused                  the entire Earth to wobble, just like knocking over a bowl                  of soup in a restaurant, which created this huge wipeout. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we&rsquo;ve got all&hellip; Although it&rsquo;s a paradox                  and we haven&rsquo;t kind of got there yet, the human race                  has got this sort of future-perspective-ancestral-memory of                  this thing. Everyone&rsquo;s looking around thinking: <em>My                  god! You know, we&rsquo;re in deep trouble, and what&rsquo;s                  this 2012 thing about?</em> And people are talking catastrophes                  and pole shifts.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it&rsquo;s                    almost impossible to find the right <em>tense</em> to                  use in the English language. It&rsquo;s like this <em>did</em> happen                  in the future and the future humans came back and said: <em>Listen,                  we know why this happened, because it happened to us. If you                  decommission or dismantle these Looking-glasses and Stargates,                  then this won&rsquo;t happen to you.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then this creates a new, different, timeline. And we have                  been credibly assured by Dan Burisch, who took part in a special                  project last year, 2007, to check out whether the decommissioning                  of the Looking-glasses and Stargates had actually been effective. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And his summary was that, yes, the catastrophe has been avoided.                  This will not happen. But what they did see was a whole bunch                  of other stuff which has been coming at us for the last 6 to                  9 months. And this has focused our attention. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in                    this intelligence probe - it&rsquo;s a time portal                  intelligence probe into the future - the catastrophic future                  timeline which they called Timeline 2, that apparently is very                  improbable now. That is, they are assured that this will not                  happen. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What they <em>did</em> see                    on Timeline 1, which is the non-catastrophic timeline&hellip; and it&rsquo;s                    Variant 83 which they saw. They had to call it something,                    and there are a number of variants, and this has all got                  to do with quantum probabilities. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What they                    saw was that before the US election in 2008 (and here we                    are now!), there would be a war which would be launched that                    then would be inherited by the next administration, the president                    of which would be Hillary Clinton! &hellip; which                  is interesting, because this doesn&rsquo;t look to be the case.                  There would have to be a lot of strange events occur for this                  to the case. So it looks as if that timeline has been broken.                  But for a long time this was not certain. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the                    events on that Variant 83 of Timeline 1 are not only a war                    against Iran, but an economic collapse which is associated                  with that, and then an enormous mess which is pretty bad news                  and certainly something to be avoided if at all possible, that                  involves various nuclear exchanges&hellip; Pakistan, Russian,                  China, a whole bunch of nasty stuff. Not the civilization-stopper,                  but certainly something that involves quite a lot of hard times                  in the next 18 months to 2 years. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And ever                    since that news was discovered, as it were, various factions                    have been trying to avert this, because we do have free will                    and the future is not cast in stone. And the very first thing                    that happened after this was discovered was that Mike McConnell                    -- who&rsquo;s a good guy and he&rsquo;s the                  Director of National Intelligence, the USDNI, as he&rsquo;s                  called -- he instructed his intelligence organization to publish                  what is called the National Intelligence Estimate on the 3rd                  of December last year [2007] which stated that Iran was not                  a threat. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, that was not in the timeline that was seen, so this was                  the first attempt to actually change things and to avert the                  war.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And basically                    ever since then, there&rsquo;s been in a push-me/pull-you                  between the factions who actually <em>want</em> this war to                  happen -- because they&rsquo;re driven by all kinds of crazy                  Illuminati prophecies about end times and Armageddon, and they                  actually want this thing to happen. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Dan Burisch has said in the past, that because for so many                  years the politicians of the world have known what seems to                  be lying ahead, based on this time portal information, they                  have just been actors following a script, just following what                  they kind of believe in a quasi-religious way is their destiny. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    is really alarming, because where this destiny goes is somewhere                    that doesn&rsquo;t look like particularly good                  news for the human race. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, at                    this point I&rsquo;m gonna take another deep breath                  here.

And, just to recap for a second what we were                    talking about before the break, we were talking about how                  Timeline 1, variant 83 has been possibly changed. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this                    moment the information we&rsquo;re getting is that                  actually the timeline is changing so rapidly that something                  that was planned and in the works for a few months ago may                  not be actually occurring the way people think it will, and                  that goes for massive events. It goes for some of the weather                  wars that are going on behind the scenes, and some of the plans                  that are being made to launch attacks on Iran, and so on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lately                    we have, in the last two months, just launched a new website                    that&rsquo;s sort of the sister website to Project                  Camelot, called Project Avalon and you can go there. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://projectavalon.net" target="_blank">projectavalon.net</a>.                  We have a forum there which is actually exploding and taking                  off in an incredible manner. We had something like 13,000 visitors                  in the first week or so. And then we&rsquo;re                  up to 2,000 users at the moment. That&rsquo;s not counting                  the people that just visit every day, but actual registered                  users. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it&rsquo;s                    all about building communities, finding safe places and networking                    for the coming day that includes the future, creating a new                    future, hopefully a new paradigm, from where we are now,                  up to and beyond 2012.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we                    just see 2012 as being just one day. We see we&rsquo;re                  in the throes of a complete global change and hopefully an                  emergence of a different consciousness. And the old paradigm                  is quickly destroying itself. And we plan to replace it. And                  so we&rsquo;re gonna do our bit here.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Project                    Camelot was all about stating the problem. And Project Avalon                    is all about creating a solution. So we&rsquo;re hoping                  to continue along those lines. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of                    the things with Project Avalon is also that we&rsquo;re                  making available resources for building communities and for,                  you know, eco-friendly communities, anything you need to know                  to set yourself up, and maybe a small group of people, in a                  safe place. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There will                    be Earth changes in the future. We&rsquo;re having,                  you know, some pretty heavy-duty storms, as you&rsquo;re seeing                  already, and there may be some escalations along those lies. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There certainly are <em>weathers wars,</em> so                    even things that are naturally induced by the Earth itself                    and some of the planetary and galactic changes that we are                    going through are going to be aggravated by actual weather                    technology which is being, I guess you might say, misused                    by The Powers That Be, Russia, China, the US. So there&rsquo;s                  that aspect of things that you also have to be aware of.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Kerry, let me ask you a question. Are you saying                  that the weather issues that we&rsquo;ve been having in perhaps                  recent years, or even this year, is the result of the weather                  manipulation by the government powers?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Yes. I&rsquo;m saying that in addition to the natural                  changes that are going on, and that means, you know, things                  going on with the sun although right now the sun has been incredibly                  quiet, there have been some &ldquo;hits&rdquo; on both sides.                  There&rsquo;s a lot of thought that the Chinese earthquake                  was a targeted hit, and Ben Fulford has come forward to talk                  about that. We&rsquo;ve got a recorded interview with him.                  He&rsquo;s also talked about that, I believe, on Rense. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s                    hard to prove this sort of thing unless you get a black-ops                    person coming forward. I have to say that, other than perhaps                    Tom Bearden, there are not a lot of people out there that                    are willing to come forward and talk about the weather wars                  side of things. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That was one incident. The tsunami in Indonesia was apparently,                  possibly, caused by an undersea hit, electromagnetic hit.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Well, what&rsquo;s                    the point? I mean, are they testing? Or are they actually                    targeting these different areas? And if they are, for what                  purpose?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well, from what we understand&hellip; I                    mean, you have to sort of go back to Project Camelot and                    drill down through all the different witnesses, but what                  it comes down to is the Illuminati Agenda. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What that                    is encompasses is, in the short term&hellip; If                  you want to look at what&rsquo;s called the <a href="Report_from_Iron_Mountain.pdf" target="_blank">Iron                  Mountain Report</a> -- and we have had that substantiated by                  Henry Deacon. We&rsquo;ve                  got a link to it on our site under Henry Deacon, but you can                  also just do a search on the web for Iron Mountain Report.                  Basically that lays out what WAS the Illuminati Agenda. And                  that started somewhere back in, gosh, I don&rsquo;t know, the &rsquo;60s                  at least, and going forward. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However,                    what happened since then is that&hellip; And that                  had to do with population reduction. That was the bottom line:                  that the Earth was going to become overpopulated and they,                  the people in control, wanted to get rid of what was said to                  be 2/3 of the population. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Henry Deacon, who is one of our witnesses, has come forward                  and talked about how he was given that report and told to sit                  down and read it, digest it, and understand that <em>We are                  the wolves and they are the sheep</em>. And this is what&rsquo;s                  going on.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is                    further to that, and this kind of piggybacks on what Bill                    had been talking about with the timeline changing, is Dan                    Burisch saying that all bets are off, that the Looking-glasses                  have been shut down, The Powers That Be no longer theoretically                  are able to see their future (which was helping them make decisions,                  right? They were able to select the best decision for their                  own ego gratification and therefore move ahead.) &hellip; that                  all the bets are off, at this point, with regard to that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although                    we have to say that this is the party-line that we&rsquo;ve                  been given. I have to say that it&rsquo;s possible THE POWERS                  THAT BE, being fairly devious, and certainly the Vatican is                  part of all of this, possibly have other means by which to                  see the future because it&rsquo;s a technology that was taken                  from cylinder seals, Sumerian, and before that from the ETs.                  It also came, as Bill said, with the crash at either Roswell                  or Kingman, whichever one you want to believe.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But all                    we&rsquo;re saying here is that that timeline, the                  timeline in which a catastrophe was in the works, nuclear war                  definitely, and various other things, <em>possibly</em> has                  been averted. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although                    I have to say here that recently we&rsquo;ve had                  communication with Dan Burisch in which he stated -- and he&rsquo;s                  put this on his own eaglesdisobey.net forum -- he says that                  the Orions are up above the Earth sitting in ships with American,                  possibly people, officers, from other countries (the Secret                  Space Program), and they&rsquo;re watching to make sure that                  indeed the catastrophe does not happen. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So they&rsquo;re                    sort of standing by on the off-chance that things take a                    really dark turn. Certainly our economy is taking a dark                  turn at the moment.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Could you just clarify real quick&hellip; this                    catastrophe? Is it projected to be a certain time? Are we                  talking 2012? Is there anything about that in this?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; I mean&hellip; Well, it&rsquo;s                    the standard end of the Mayan calendar. Bill kind of outlined                  the various events, one of which is a pole shift. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have                    mixed information on this. As you know&hellip; Because                  when we created Camelot, it wasn&rsquo;t only about whistleblowers.                  It became about <em>truth-tellers</em> getting word to us from,                  you know, all kind of different places. And in fact we have                  a scientist who we <em>cannot</em> name who came forward, who                  has gone to work for -- I think I can say this safely enough                  -- Homeland Security. He was called in to work for them. And                  he came forward secretly to us and stated that there <em>would</em> be                  a pole shift. There would be what I guess Ed Dames has called                  a &ldquo;kill-shot&rdquo; from the sun, and I believe, a magnetic                  pole shift as well.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; What                    was interesting is that we got a one-liner email. And we                    get many, many one-liners from people, saying, you know: <em>Great                  job on your site. We really like what you&rsquo;re doing. Good                  luck to you guys.</em> And we usually, you know, send a reply                  saying: <em>Hey thanks a bunch.</em> But he signed himself                  a name of somebody who I recognized. And I got back to him                  saying: <em>Are you who I think you are?</em> [laughs] who                  was a name that many of your listeners would recognize. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he said: <em>Yes. I am that person</em>.                    And he was responding to us privately. He hadn&rsquo;t come                    knocking at our door as a whistleblower; he just said, <em>Hey look, you know, I                  like your site.</em> And we have had messages like that from                  a lot of insiders, who just like seeing what we&rsquo;re doing                  because it does reflect many aspects of the truth in what they                  see. And we checked his e-mail address, whether he was the                  real guy, his IP address, and all that kind of verification. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we found ourselves thinking: <em>Hey,                      we&rsquo;re talking                    to a guy who&rsquo;s a brilliant scientist. We&rsquo;ll just                    ask him a question or two</em>. And this was two years ago.                    And the time span is really important because things <em>have</em> changed                    since then. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We said to him, basically: <em>What                      do you know and what can you tell us about what&rsquo;s                      coming up?</em> <br>                And he said: <em>We&rsquo;re in for a very tough time, and                  I don&rsquo;t want to be the bearer of bad news.</em> He said                  there will be three events in the next few years, starting                  in 2009. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said the first one would be a [#1] <u>coronal mass ejection</u> [from                  the sun]. And he said: <em>To see what I mean, look up the                  event of 1859,</em> which we did. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The event                    of 1859 was before the electronic era, of course, and this                    was when the Earth was basically bombarded by massive fireworks                    display from the sun which created auroral displays as far                    south as the Equator in both hemispheres. It was incredibly                  spectacular and everyone saw wonderful sunsets for a little                  while. But it didn&rsquo;t cause any damage because this was                  before the time of chips and circuits. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, if this happened now, a lot of stuff will get burned                  out. <em>We</em> would be OK. We&rsquo;d see all the fireworks                  but we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to talk on Skype, our cell-phones                  wouldn&rsquo;t work, we wouldn&rsquo;t have TV, we wouldn&rsquo;t                  have radio. Our cars would stop working because the electronic                  management systems would burn out. Planes would fall out of                  the sky. The only things that &hellip; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, actually                    that&rsquo;s a bit apocalyptic! Planes <em>might</em> fall                  out of the sky if the coronal mass ejection was strong enough.                  This parallels what Kerry described just now as Ed Dames having                  talked about what his team of remote viewers had seen in reference                  to a<em> &lsquo;Kill-shot&rsquo;.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, this                    scientist who contacted us wasn&rsquo;t talking                  about people getting fried by solar flares. What he was saying                  is that there is going to be something here that&rsquo;s going                  to influence our electronics all over the world.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then he said that there would a [#2] <u>magnetic pole reversa</u>l                  which we&rsquo;re given to understand is already in progress.                  And it doesn&rsquo;t affect our everyday lives very much, but                  it causes whales and dolphins to end up getting lost and beaching                  themselves in the wrong place. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it causes all kinds of interesting effects on our <em>minds</em>,                  the way that we think, because we are electromagnetic biophysical                  beings, at least at the physical level, and as the Earth&rsquo;s                  magnetic field starts to go through its various fluctuations,                  we are all affected <em>behaviorally</em> by this, which is                  very, very, very interesting. As that destabilizes, we destabilize                  as well <em>emotionally</em> at least to some degree, to the                  degree that, you know&hellip; We are spiritual beings operating                  this body through the interface of our brains, which is an                  electromagnetic environment, essentially. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then finally, he said, [#3] <u>the pole shift</u>.                    That&rsquo;s                  like a kind of a slam-dunk, yeah? And now, he said this <em>before</em> we                  got the news from Dan Burisch in 2007, as a result of the decommissioning                  of the Stargates and Looking-glasses, that the pole shift had                  been averted. So this is not contradictory information. It                  just confirms, basically, that this was what was in the cards                  at that time in 2006.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what&rsquo;s really interesting is, you know, how come                  a brilliant scientist, whose name is well-known in the public                  arena, is contracted to the Department of Homeland Security?                  I mean, that&rsquo;s really interesting. And of course, as                  an Englishman, I couldn&rsquo;t really understand this at first. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But then                    a number of my American friends helped me to understand that                    the Department of Homeland Security&hellip; This is like                  a very innocuous name for basically an over-riding intelligence                  organization that&rsquo;s senior to just about everything else,                  and is handling not just issues of immigration and border control,                  but major, major areas of anything that&rsquo;s related to                  national security. And it&rsquo;s just got an innocuous name                  that looks like it was invented by George Orwell. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, that&rsquo;s                my enlargement on that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; The thing that&rsquo;s so frightening about that                  is, if all of our electronic systems go down, it&rsquo;s going                  to disrupt everything globally, the banking system, everything.                  Certainly what&rsquo;s going on now is not good, but if we                  have something of that magnitude, that&rsquo;s going to cause                  an incredible collapse of just about everything.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. Well, actually Henry Deacon has come forward                  and has been talking to us about this electromagnetic &ldquo;shot&rdquo; that                  will happen at some point. And he actually says it will be                  induced by The Powers That Be, or could be. And he talks about                  safeguarding your electronics by wrapping them in aluminum                  foil and burying them in the dirt. [laughs] And on top of that,                  even cars navigate and are run by computers, so you have to                  understand how far-reaching this really is. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then, at the same time, we had Dan Sherman, even before                  that, come forward, and talked about being actually, you know,                  genetically engineered by the ETs and the US government to                  be an ET interpreter, trained as an interpreter by the military,                  to operate during that time, this unique time, when the electromagnetic                  grid would go down. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&rsquo;s unclear how long it&rsquo;ll be down for, but one                  assumes that if you&rsquo;re gonna train a group of ET communicators&hellip; And                  one might want to delve into why you&rsquo;d need <em>ET</em> <em>communicators</em> when                  you have electromagnetic grid shut-down. That means that THE                  POWERS THAT BE are going to be communicating with the ETs during                  that time. And they have no other way to do it except psychically,                  with what are in essence trained psychics. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that&rsquo;s what Dan Sherman was. So he rebelled. He                  became a whistleblower. And you can find his website. I believe                  it&rsquo;s called aboveblack.com.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At any                    rate, when we get information, it often becomes substantiated                  from more than one place, and so this idea of an electromagnetic                  breakdown of the grid has been substantiated from a number                  of different angles, people who don&rsquo;t know anything about                  each other.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G:&nbsp; Have                    you guys got any idea as to how folks, THE POWERS THAT BE,                    the Illuminati or whatever, are planning on maintaining their                    own survival, for perpetuating their staying on top of the                  heap, so to speak?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Our understanding, again, is the underground bases                  is what they&rsquo;ve provided for themselves. And this fits                  in with what Dan Burisch talked about in terms of the future                  humans coming back and saying that a certain group of humanity                  goes underground. I mean, there are <em>huge</em> underground                  cities that have been built for the time when the sun would                  become overactive, for the shift on the planet&hellip;if we                  have such a thing as a pole shift. So all of these things have                  been provided for, again, by The Powers That Be, and they&rsquo;re                  well aware of it. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trouble                    is, for them, in essence, is that the things that they were                    planning for don&rsquo;t seem to be in the works                  any more, for a number of reasons, one of which is that the                  consciousness on the planet is changing, and that we, because                  we are co-creators of our own destiny, are able to affect the                  future of what is happening. And that as humanity wakes up                  -- and this is what our whole quest on Camelot was all about,                  was to wake up as many people as possible, to get onboard and                  know what was really going on, break through the matrix, if                  you will -- such that we can actually change the program. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so                    that seems to be happening. We&rsquo;ve gotten several                  indications that it is. However, there are also very strong                  indicators that <em>at the moment</em> we are approaching a                  very important time --which is right now through the month                  of October -- in which The Powers That Be may want to do something                  drastic in order to coalesce their power and stay afloat, at                  least in the United States. That would be the Neocon faction.                  And that they apparently&hellip; </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you listen to our recent audio interview with David Wilcock,                  he gives a wonderful summation of what went down in Georgia,                  and how the Israelis had planned to attack Iran from Georgia,                  and how that plan was actually worded, and how the Russians                  got hip to that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And you                    have to understand that within the US military and the whole                    Neocon faction you&rsquo;ve also got MJ12, and you&rsquo;ve                  got elements which are onboard with the Illuminati Agenda and                  are trying to make the depopulation through war, through disease,                  through Earth changes, whether they&rsquo;re provoked or allowed                  to just happen. There&rsquo;s one group like that. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then                    you also have what is called often by our people, the &ldquo;White Hats&rdquo; who will work behind the scenes                  to try to make sure that these things don&rsquo;t happen the                  way The Powers That Be would like them to.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Kerry, so these White Hats are&hellip;?                Generals?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Apparently they&rsquo;re generals in the military.                  They&rsquo;re people like&hellip; Mike McConnell could be termed                  a white hat.

Now, there are always, you know, there&rsquo;s                  a punch/counter-punch, as you can imagine. If you watch the                  news, you can actually watch this happening in the various                  reports. As controlled as the media is, you can still watch                  their, sort of, roll-out and read between the lines if you                  become skilled at it, and if in essence you have the kind of                  backdrop of what Camelot has investigated --and, you know,                  numerous other, certainly, researchers and investigators, like                  Jordan Maxwell, David Icke, both of whom we plan to be interviewing                  in the next week or so at the Bay Area UFO Conference.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Very interesting stuff.

It&rsquo;s one of these little                  anecdotes that&rsquo;s quite a good place to start. This is                  an email that we got two days ago and it was on the back of                  a whole bunch of emails that we got a little bit earlier on                  in the summer, from somebody, a regular person. And there are                  lot of regular people who are very alert and aware, who follow                  our work, watch our site, and who know people in high places                  or in the intelligence agencies, so they say. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were first contacted by this person in July, who said that                  he had a friend in the alphabet agencies who we had reason                  to believe was fairly senior. who said that if they were going                  to be deployed to the Middle East, then war would be a done                  deal. Unquote. That war was a certainty.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; All                right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m                  just quoting that because those were the words he used.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; That                is war with Iran, just to clarify that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Right.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; Yeah.                    And we got an email two days ago saying that this guy had                  been deployed to the Middle East. So&hellip;</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Actually, he&rsquo;s being deployed this week. [The                  email] was a few days ago, so it was &ldquo;next week&rdquo; and                  now it&rsquo;s <em>this</em> week. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we have a blog on the front of Project Camelot that we                  now keep, because one of the things we realized that we had                  to do was to take the backlog of information that we have as                  Camelot and help people to use that to interpret news events                  that are going on. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And also                    to be able to report other whistleblowers and people that                    report information to us that&rsquo;s not long enough                  for, say, an interview or even a whole page, but is sometimes                  very key information telling people what&rsquo;s happening                  and what may be happening very soon. So that&rsquo;s our blog                  on the first page of Project Camelot. So it&rsquo;s a good                  place to check in and see what&rsquo;s really new.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But to                    continue, Bill, why don&rsquo;t you tell how the information                  about October is actually starting to really stack up.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; Yeah. It&rsquo;s starting to stack up. And the analogy                  that I use is that of data points on a graph. It&rsquo;s like,                  if you are collecting information and you&rsquo;re plotting                  it on a graph -- and I say this because I&rsquo;m a trained                  scientist quite a long time back. But if you get data-clustering,                  then it <em>means</em> something. This is not random. You start                  to see a shape forming. You start to see trends forming. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we&rsquo;ve                    seen this data-clustering pointing towards October for quite                    a while. And this e-mail that we got just a couple days ago                    is just the <em>latest</em> confirmation.                  It&rsquo;s like, well OK, the guy&rsquo;s gone to the Middle                  East. You know &hellip; Ohhh &hellip; you know. What does this                  mean? I won&rsquo;t swear now, but I did when I read the e-mail. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To go back &hellip; Now this is interesting because there                  are interesting points that come to this. We were contacted                  in May 2007 -- that&rsquo;s pretty much 18 months ago now --                  by somebody who was&hellip; We weren&rsquo;t contacted directly,                  but we were contacted by an intermediary for somebody who was                  associated with one of the Montauk Projects, who was involved                  in the Montauk Project in 1984. And this another whole area                  which you can do two-hour show on just that alone. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Montauk                    Projects, we are assured, were real. They had to do with                    time travel, time manipulation, all the mess of stuff that                    I was talking about in the first hour. And this guy&hellip; In                    1984, one of the things that they were doing, was they were                    messing around as I was describing, using technology that                    they barely understood, with fixing up, manipulating, and                  peering into, over the time horizon, into future timelines. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    guy said that for years he had been talking about what he                    recalled from that project, that in 2007, 2008, there would                    be two main markers of that time period, one of which would                    be food riots, OK? And we got this, as I said, in May 2007.                    We didn&rsquo;t publish this information because we didn&rsquo;t                  believe him. We thought: <em>Food riots? People are gonna think                  we&rsquo;re crazy.</em> And we sat on that information. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other component of what he said besides the food riots,                  was he made reference to what he called the <em>King George                  Scenario.</em> And this was in 1984 he heard it. And <em>King                  George</em> refers to George Bush. They knew about him as the                  future president in 1984, 16 years before he was elected. And                  they called it the <em>King George Scenario</em> because kings                  aren&rsquo;t elected. Kings get to stay in power all the time,                  and they never step down after 8 years. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <em>King George Scenario</em> apparently was that some                  event would occur before George Bush, before his term of office                  ended, that would actually create the need, the false need,                  or the <em>fake</em> need or whatever, for him to stay in power.                  And we&rsquo;re still waiting for this. OK. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This may or may not happen because timelines <em>do</em> change.                  But in the metaphor told us by another one of our witnesses,                  Jim Sparks -- who is a multiple, almost all-the-time, fully-conscious                  abductee, who was told a whole bunch of stuff by his abductors,                  and shown some pretty alarming pictures of a potential Earth                  future --</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was                    given to understand that time is like a huge river. You think                    about like the Nile or the Mississippi or the Amazon, just                    this giant river that&rsquo;s flowing along and we&rsquo;re                  flowing down it. And it flows in a direction. And you <em>can</em> change                  the flow of this river with enough energy, but it&rsquo;s always                  gonna want to keep on flowing in the direction which has been.                  You <em>can</em> change it, but it&rsquo;s not easy. If you                  just lob a few rocks into it, it&rsquo;s not going to make                  any difference. It needs to be a big-time change. And you can                  even divert it, but it still wants to flow back in the direction                  in which it was flowing in the first place. It&rsquo;s kind                  of got its own inertia. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so are watching to see whether this timeline has changed.                  In the meantime, our contact is expecting this to happen.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, more                    stories here, because I was talking to Henry Deacon about                    this. Henry Deacon is our black-ops insider source that we                    were talking about in the first hour. He knew about timelines,                  he knew about the future human stuff, he knew about the Roswell                  catastrophe &hellip; catastrophe because of the time device                  that was recovered in the crash which then they started tinkering                  with to create all these time loops and paradoxes that have                  not yet been resolved. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said                    to him&hellip; I was talking to him about what Dan                  Burisch referred to as Timeline 1, Version 83 and saying: <em>You                  know what? At least the timeline has changed, because it doesn&rsquo;t                  look like Hillary is going to be president. She&rsquo;s off                  the ticket. She&rsquo;s not even the vice presidential candidate                  to Obama. This is not gonna happen.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Henry said: <em>You know what?

I read that Hillary was off the ticket but something                    really weird would happen and she would end up back on the                    ticket again. And it was connected with the election being                    postponed for a couple of months.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just had these chills going down my spine.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; No                kidding.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;m just reporting a conversation that                  I had, and Henry could not remember the details, because, as                  happens with many people behind the curtain of black-ops, they&rsquo;re                  exposed to documents, they&rsquo;re exposed to plans. Some                  of these things do change. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the thing that is <em>so</em> hard to believe and so alarming                  to believe is that many of these global events are orchestrated                  and choreographed years or even decades before. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carol Rosen,                    who we don&rsquo;t know and we haven&rsquo;t                  talked to, but many of your listeners will know, who worked                  closely with Wernher von Braun, went on record with the Disclosure                  Project, is saying that she learned about the invasion of Iraq                  in 1991 (Operation Desert Storm) back in the <em>1970s.</em> She                  sat in on meetings where this was being planned and being discussed. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The whole                    thing is being choreographed right from the beginning. That&rsquo;s just one little example. And so we&rsquo;re                    left with this snippet of extraordinary information, Henry                    saying: <em>You                  know what? Just watch out, because if something were to happen,                  Hillary&rsquo;s back on the ticket.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reason                    why I made reference to what Jim Sparks said about the flow                    of time being like a giant river&hellip; you can divert                  it, but you better keep it in place with a lot of energy. Otherwise                  it&rsquo;s going to try to head back to where it was flowing                  and where it wants to flow in the first place, like water flowing                  downhill. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Hillary                    is on the ticket, there&rsquo;s good reason to                  believe that we&rsquo;re all in a great deal of trouble, because                  what happens after that is a whole bunch of nuclear exchanges. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we&rsquo;ve got George Green, who we haven&rsquo;t yet                  spoken about in this conversation. George Green, for those                  of your listeners who don&rsquo;t know him&hellip; He was an                  ex-Air Force engineer. He was in banking. He was in construction.                  He was in politics. He has a lot of friends in high places.                  And he is also somebody who has been in contact with the Pleiadians                  and other extra-terrestrial sources, for quite a number of                  years. He has a very unique r&eacute;sum&eacute;, as it were.                  And he&rsquo;s been talking about this stuff for quite a while. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of                    the things that inspired us to create Project Avalon was                    because George Green said that in his communications that                  he has received from the Pleiadians -- the Pleiadians being                  off planet, human-appearing, benevolent, extra-terrestrials;                  maybe they come from another place in time, we don&rsquo;t                  know. But he gets a lot of information from them. He said that                  it&rsquo;s almost too late. This is what he said. Almost too                  late. And he made references to a bunch of people he calls &ldquo;the                  ground crew.&rdquo; He wrote a little book which&hellip; He                  almost kind of took this book by dictation, which is available                  on his website for free. It&lsquo;s called <em>Messages for                  the Ground Crew. </em></font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; You                have the URL for that?</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s                called nomorehoaxes.com. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s actually a set of three books. Another                  one&rsquo;s called <em>Embracing the Rainbow.</em> Another                  one&rsquo;s called <em>Handbook for the New Paradigm</em>.                  The first one he wrote with the aid of the Pleiadians is <em>Handbook                  for the New Paradigm</em> and that was the one that actually                  talked about people getting ready, moving into rural areas,                  establishing small communities -- basically what we&rsquo;re                  attempting to do now with Project Avalon to provide a network                  where that sort of thing can happen. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I have                    to say this book was written several years ago. So he was                    way ahead of the curve. And now what his communicators are                    telling him is that we&hellip; the time is actually past                  for educating people, that we are getting very close to the                  time when these events would actually start to happen.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they do talk about a war behind the scenes between their                  faction, the Pleiadians and various other benevolent ETs, and                  the negative-oriented entities that are out there working with                  the US military among other groups, certainly the Vatican.                  So you see there is a scenario behind the scenario that you                  actually have to keep in mind.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But at any rate, we are getting information and George is                  one of the people that has been talking about the whole economic                  downturn. He has predicted this very accurately, what is even                  as we speak, what is happening here this month. We were told                  September would be the month. And sure enough, it appears to                  be when the economy would begin to crash very seriously. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We had                    been told by him a year ago to put all our money in gold                    or silver and get it out of the market. We followed his advice.                    Once upon a time that was really good advice. I have to say                    that unfortunately The Powers That Be seem to be hitting                    the gold and silver markets very seriously the last month,                  which was another indicator that something big was coming along,                  because they were driving down the price of gold, one might                  think so that they could, I guess, get into the market, and                  then be prepared for what&rsquo;s happening right now in which                  gold and silver are now starting to go back up. We&rsquo;ve                  got Michael St. Claire also talking about these sorts of things,                  by the way.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what                    is happening, what we&rsquo;re looking at right now,                  is information we&rsquo;re getting from a lot of different                  sources and it all is coming together around the month of October,                  basically saying that in the month of October there seems to                  be some event that seems to want to be taking place. It&rsquo;s                  not gonna be a positive event. I wish I could say it was, but                  it will have something to do with either postponing the election                  or making it such that the Neocons will get their sort of agenda                  back on track after their debacle of Georgia. And we don&rsquo;t                  know what the event is, so we can&rsquo;t actually say anything                  about&hellip; too much about that.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; Do                    you want to say anything about Hawkeye, Kerry? Tell them                  about Hawkeye, our source.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; OK, well Hawkeye is sort of a whistleblower from                  within the Illuminati. He calls them &ldquo;The Roths.&rdquo; [laughs]                  And he says that&hellip; Well, I can&rsquo;t&hellip; I have                  to be very careful as to how much detail I go into because                  we do want to protect him. We published a lot of information                  from him on our blog which is, again, on the front page of                  Project Camelot.org. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he                    was basically telling us all the same things that Henry Deacon                    was telling us, that we were getting from other sources,                    George Green, and a number of other deep black sources. And                  he&rsquo;s a very interesting guy. He&rsquo;s written us, I                  think, for the past year, and we&rsquo;ve got a huge score                  of emails from him, basically telling us it&rsquo;s getting                  closer. The time&rsquo;s getting closer. Their agenda is being                  rolled out. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His point                    of view is that the&hellip; Whatever the White Hats                  are trying to do, they&rsquo;re actually not gonna be successful.                  I have to say that because of his position, because he feels                  so oppressed, if you will&hellip; He&rsquo;s, you know, heavily                  monitored. He used to work for the Illuminati. Basically he&rsquo;s                  had to buy into their scenario. He believes their power is                  pretty much a done deal.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; What he said is that there would be a major event                  that he said, basically&hellip; I mean, he used very dramatic                  language. He said it would be the <em>coup d&rsquo;etat for                  the human race</em> and he said this would in the first 10                  days of October. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Right. And what&rsquo;s weird about that is there&rsquo;s                  also this halfpasthuman website that&rsquo;s also doing data                  mining on the web, using language and computers to create&hellip; I                  guess they&rsquo;ve been doing a whole layout like a graph                  of where people are at and certain events. And they did it                  for 911. They predicted accurately the recent resignation within                  a day of Mushariff. We are hoping to possibly interview them.                  I know they&rsquo;ve been interviewed by Rense.

It was in the                  news today about Iran has once again, you know, thumbed their                  nose at the European community about nuclear testing, about                  proceeding with developing their nuclear abilities. And then,                  of course, we have the Pakistanis being very upset with the                  Americans who are launching commando raids into Pakistan. It                  just seems like, you know, maybe the pieces are falling into                  place here, you know, especially in light of what&rsquo;s been                  going on in Georgia as well.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K:&nbsp; Well, you guys had asked us during the break if we                  could talk about why we&rsquo;re being able to get information                  out there, and if we&rsquo;ve been attacked in any way.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s a great question. Let&rsquo;s hang                  on to that one for just a moment. We&rsquo;re coming down to                  the bottom of the hour, the last half hour. Man, this time                  has gone fast. Jeepers! [break]</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the remaining time that we have, what would you like to                  say? What message would you really like to get out there? And                  I do have a question after you go.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B:&nbsp; First of all, I&rsquo;m                    a Brit, as you can tell. And during the Second World War                    the Brits experienced something which they called <em>The</em> <em>Spirit of the Blitz</em>.                  And <em>The Spirit of the Blitz</em> was a community spirit                  that arose spontaneously in London when it was being bombed                  by the Germans.<br>                <br>                The authorities didn&rsquo;t have to do as                  much as they might have had to do because the citizens did                  it themselves. The citizens took care of each other; they took                  care of each other&rsquo;s medical needs; they took each other                  into their homes when their homes had been wrecked. They put                  out fires. They provided food and water for each other. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The community                    spirit was incredibly strong. This is -- if you don&rsquo;t                    mind my waving our Union Jack here -- this is one of the                    reasons, and with American help of course, the Nazis were                  defeated. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, we&rsquo;re more vulnerable now than we have ever been                  before because that community spirit -- in the days of the                  internet where people are partially connected by technology                  but also partially disconnected by it -- we&rsquo;re living                  in an age where we don&rsquo;t know our neighbors. We don&rsquo;t                  know the people who live on the other side of that anonymous                  door on the other side of the corridor in our apartment block. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We don&rsquo;t really live in communities in the way that                  we used to. We&rsquo;re much more isolated. We&rsquo;re much                  more mobile. And even the family unit isn&rsquo;t as strong                  as it used to be. And this is our weakness. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But back                    to Project Avalon, what we&rsquo;re trying to do                  there is, we&rsquo;re trying to rekindle the spirit of community,                  because that would be the strength <em>if</em> times become                  tough. We&rsquo;re much more likely to be able to have a smooth                  ride through whatever the next few years brings for us if we                  know who our neighbors are, if we are in touch with our families,                  if we forget our little squabbles and we learn how to work                  together with people who maybe we might have trivial disagreements                  with or whom we decide we don&rsquo;t like. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And these                    communities don&rsquo;t have to be <em>avant garde</em> communities                  like Findhorn or Esalen or Damanhur or any of these other places.                  It could be a street, or it could be a district, or a city,                  or it could be a small bunch of people in an area who know                  that they can count on each other if things are difficult. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this                    is what George Green, who I was talking about half an hour                    ago, referred to when he talked about the Ground Crew, that                    there are some people out there who will not listen to any                    of these problems. They won&rsquo;t be woken up. I mean                  them no disrespect, but they&rsquo;re NOT awake and alert to                  what is happening, but other people are. And the people who                  are listening to this show, by default these will be those                  people who are at the front line, and who are listening. They&rsquo;re                  thinking: <em>What can I do? What can I do? </em>Everyone&rsquo;s                  situation is different.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Project Avalon which we formed so we could create solutions,                  we have a forum which is exploded into the most extraordinary                  activity, thousands of viewers in just a few days. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there                    are people there&hellip; There are whole threads                  on this forum which are devoted to groups getting together,                  people saying: <em>Hey, listen, I&rsquo;m in Idaho; who else                  in Idaho?</em> Or: <em>I&rsquo;m in New Zealand; who else is                  in New Zealand?</em> Or: <em>I&rsquo;m in the Bronx and I&rsquo;m                  stuck here, is there anyone else in New York? I want to know                  who you are because I want to know who I can trust.</em> </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And these                    people are getting together. They&rsquo;re forming                  groups, they&rsquo;re forming networks, they&rsquo;re making                  plans and establishing meeting places. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, this                    doesn&rsquo;t have to be like negative catastrophic                  thinking, because these are good things to happen even if nothing                  bad goes down. And so, to some degree, it <em>is</em> about                  a renaissance. It <em>is</em> about a reconnection. It <em>is</em> about                  people connecting with each other and rebuilding the kind of                  society and the kind of networking that is the sign of a <em>healthy</em> society.                  We&rsquo;re finding that our society is not as healthy as it                  used to be in the past. And if these threats of geopolitical                  events spur us on to talking to people we&rsquo;ve forgotten                  how to talk to, then that&rsquo;s actually no bad thing.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the other thing I want to say, must more briefly than                  I have just said, is that we create our own future. As the                  Buddhists say: <em>We are dreamers that are dreaming each others&rsquo; dreams.</em> All                  of this is a very solid-looking dream that we find ourselves                  in. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the future is not written in stone despite all this high                  technology that we were talking about, to do with timelines                  and timeline variations. They exist probabilities and possibilities.                  And we can create any future that we want, any future that                  we choose, and we human beings have the ability to do this. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bill Birnes, who is the editor of <em>UFO Magazine</em> and                  a very well-respected UFO researcher&hellip; at the end of                  his life he interviewed Admiral George Hoover before he died. </font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Bill Birnes didn&rsquo;t                die.

And what is happening with the timelines that we&rsquo;ve                  been describing and the fact that suddenly all bets are off                  and suddenly they changed so quickly that plans that have been                  in place for years and years by The Powers That Be and their                  minions -- which is just average people feeling that they are                  powerless, giving their power over to the ruling class, and                  allowing them to manipulate them -- if they take their power                  back and begin to rethink what it is we&rsquo;re doing here                  on the planet. Because this is a grand experiment and the reality                  is that we are all spiritual beings much far beyond our physical                  bodies.</font></p>                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D:&nbsp; Well                    you know, excellent, excellent information.
