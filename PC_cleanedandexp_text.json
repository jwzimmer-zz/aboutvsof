"\n\ncynthia crawford et sculptor \n\n\n\ncynthia\ncrawford (cc this is going to be an exciting time i also have\nsome stories to tell you of people who have experienced the beings\nafter having a sculpture now mind you i am not allowed to sell the\nsculptures if\nthere is something you really want to buy you may buy it but i\nam not here to sell these and i will tell you why i do not\nsell these sculptures i do not talk anybody into buying a\nsculpture when\ni make the sculptures first of all they know who is going to\nbuy them they need to get into the right hands they identify with\nthe right person if you do not feel a connection i say do not\nbuy it it is not going to serve you at all okay the\nother thing i tell people is you never want to buy a sculpture if\nyou are afraid to have contact okay if you are afraid to\nhave contact do not ever buy a sculpture because when i was in\nalamo nevada doing a conference a gentleman who had had contact\nand never was allowed to remember who he had had contact with decided\nhe wanted to buy a mantis being so he bought a mantis being and lo and behold a month later he\ncontacted me and said i\nhave been downloaded with visions of what is going to happen in\nthe future i have been given spiritual teachings to help me in\nmy ascension but one night i woke up and there were three beings in\nmy room and\nhe said i\ndid not expect it and so i told them \u201cget out of here i\ndo not want you in here and\ni said oh that is too bad i am really sorry to hear that next time\nthey appear this is all you have to do tell them you can\ntalk to me telepathically but until i am ready to see you and\nexperience you please just do it telepathically okay let\nme tell you a little bit about me cynthia crawford i was born a\ntwin my mother when i was born i was born without an amniotic\nsac my twin sister was born with an amniotic sac but we had totally\ndifferent blood types and tissue types when\nwe were five years old my twin sister never learned to walk like a\nnormal person she walked on her tiptoes and fell a lot and the\ndoctors diagnosed her with muscular dystrophy my\nfather by the way was in the army and worked on top secret missions\nno one was allowed to know about okay i do not know if that\ngives you a clue where i am going with this okay this is what\nhappened the\ndoctors took samples from me because they thought if they\ntransplanted my muscle tissue in my twin\u2019s legs she might walk\nagain they could not do the transplant we were not matches even though we were twins it was as if we were never related i\ndid not find out until i was in my early 30s when my father came to\nme and my mother and father were divorced when i was quite young and\nmy mother was a very very devout christian and my father was an\nagnostic and\nmy father came to me and he said have\nyou ever wondered why you have always had contact with the\nbeings have you ever wondered why you have had babies taken from\nyou by the beings okay have\nyou ever wondered why you are the only one in the family that is\nhad communication and\ni thought where\nin the world did he get this information i never told him about\nthis but he knew about it i\nalso as a child who remembered being taken to underground facilities government facilities when i was a toddler and i would cry because\ni did not want to be there they would take me to these\nunderground facilities and they would literally test me to see what\nabilities i had these\nwere military doctors and underground facilities many many many\nfloors below the surface secret facilities but i was always told\nthose were dreams so i thought oh what horrible dreams but\nmy mother never knew where she was going to find me when i was a\nchild if i would be found outside next to the door inside sleeping\non the floor or in my bed and as a teenager i would sometimes wake\nup and i was outside did not know how i got there i also had\ntimes where i thought i was in bed and the next thing i know i am\nfloating through the air up into a ship i used to hate those\n\u201cdreams well now i am in my 30s and my father\u2019s telling me this i\nfinally said why dad why have i had contact tell me and\nhe said you are\na hybrid i\nlaughed and i said no no i cannot be a hybrid because that meant there was a reason why i never felt like i\nbelonged here but i also found out at the age of 22 when i had my son and had\ncomplications with him the doctors could not give me blood\ntransfusions for i had an antigen in my blood that only two other\npeople in the whole world had now let me tell you if that does not make you feel a little bit\nweird i do not know what does audience\nmember (am no i do not know them but i will tell you this when i had my\nson at the age of 22 i\nremember waking up before of course and i woke up after being on a\nship and the ship had the ceiling walls floors all seemed to be a\nluminous glow to them and i was being told i was going to have a son he would do great things in the future to help save the planet earth and i thought whoa i am going to have a son he is going to be special i\nwas so excited and i woke up in bed and i am telling my husband he goes nah you are not pregnant no way and i made a bet and the bet was i would get a sewing machine and by\ngod that sewing machine came in handy i made my maternity clothes anyway i have had numerous healings my whole life when i was 18 years\nold because i always had a hard time fitting in i used to be a\nvery depressed child and kept feeling this was not my home so i did\na very stupid thing and i am sure you have heard of people\nlike me i\ndecided to take an overdose of aspirins and end my life i was tired\nof being on this planet and it was really stupid but i wanted relief i wanted relief from the fear of being different from the \u201cdreams of being in ships i wanted help and the way to get help was to die right i\ntook an overdose of aspirins and if anybody knows what happens when\nyou take a bottle of aspirins it works like acid in your body and it\ncompletely dissolved my vascular system i was bleeding out of every\nopening in my body my eyes i literally went blind my eyes were\nbleeding and i literally got down on my hands and knees crawled to\nthe bed laid down to die i woke up the next morning healed one\nhundred percent healed at\nthe age of 29 i had real complications with my lungs i was\nconstantly getting pneumonia and never knew if i was going to go into\na coma did not know why my lungs were so weak my twin sister\nhad died just two months before when i came down with lower-lung\npneumonia and both my lungs collapsed while i was out of town i said\nmy goodbyes telepathically to god and everybody else i\nwoke up the next morning completely healed came back to omaha nebraska where i was living the doctor took x-rays of my lungs called me in to his office and cried sat there and literally cried\nin front of me and he said you\nmust have something important to do in the future because these are\nnot your lungs these are newborn-baby lungs i\nalso was hit by a car in 1993 while i was walking across the\nstreet thrown\n35 feet up into the air 75 feet out into another street all these\nbones in here were broken had gone in and out my bladder my colon\nand intestines were all twisted and knotted up a part of my face was\ntorn off me my ears were torn off me i wear a plate in my shoulder i\nwas told that it would take six to eight months for me to walk\nagain but because my muscle tissue is anunnaki i walked in two\nmonths but because my bones are zeta bones from my dna my bones\ndid not heal like humans my bones took three times longer than a\nhuman i have both zeta dna anunnaki dna and human dna anunnaki\nis the greatest part of my dna which attributes for my muscular\nbuild when i did one time in my life start working out with weights i developed the body of a weight lifter that would take one to two\nyears to develop that body i did it in two weeks unbelievable one\nday i looked in the mirror and go i am\na man i was so muscular so i quit working out but\nanyway it was not until after when i had that accident by the\nway it took me five years to say complete sentences and to remember\none minute to the next i had lost 1/3 of my brain and i had to learn\nall over again it is quite an experience a very humbling\nexperience in 1997 i decided to give up my fear of having contact and i started going to an experiencer group and i gave up my fear and i started having contact at least one to two times a week and i began going to other planets i began going through teachings spiritual teachings which i did not expect -spiritual teachings of love i\nstarted working with this group of experiencers and i gave up my fear\nand i started having contact at least one to two times a week and i\nbegan going to other planets i began going through teachings spiritual teachings which i did not expect \u2013 spiritual\nteachings of love one\nof the first things they told me was in\norder to be in the new world which will be coming soon humans must\ngive up greed judgment and prejudice by looking beyond the physical\ncontainer to see the creator-source within each and every being not within each and every human \u2013 each and every being okay now when i gave up my fear i said okay by golly i want them to come to me now i want them to tell me why\nwas i the victim why did they want me why were they always taking\nme away why did they take my babies from time to time i\nhad three conscious memories of having babies taken from me and i\nfound out i have 23 children on other planets part of it is my\ndna doctors\ncould not explain why when at the age of 24 i had to have a\nhysterectomy why my tubes and when i was 40 years old and they\nremoved my tubes and ovaries why my tubes were like plump hotdogs\nready for a weenie roast the truth was they told me that a panel\nof doctors had examined the tissue and it was perfectly healthy i\nhad not one not two not three tubal pregnancies but at least four\nor more i only remember one because i remember waking up and having\na lot of complications with that tubal pregnancy that they took and then i found that they used my eggs what it had to do with was\nmy dna that is why they wanted me so\nanyway getting back to when i gave up fear of having contact with\nthem and said i am\nready for conscious after three weeks of begging they finally appeared to me and the\nfirst one that appeared to me was one of the most incredible loving\nbeings i had ever ever encountered and the love was beyond words there is no human description for the love they give you okay what\nhappened was on the day that he materialized i am laying in\nbed begging of course and here comes almost like star\ntrek here comes a body materializing in front of me brown skin as\nwrinkled as elephant skin very glove-leather soft i do not\nknow what kind of lotion he used but he was soft he\nhad a large head which was large here dented in the back here and\nthen went out a little bit again and then to a long thin neck long\narms arms longer than humans very muscular lean body gold eyes\nwith slits and he humbly looked down for fear he would frighten me all\ni felt was the most incredible love coming from him it was as if god\nhimself had entered my room and i had no idea i could feel this kind\nof love i had never felt it from anyone and i said to him may\ni hold your hand and he rolled out three long fingers with suction cups on the ends is\nthere anyone in this room who has woken up with these bruises three\nbruises on their thighs legs or somewhere you have and they look\nalmost like a suction cup type bruise audience member responds inaudible] on your shoulder okay do\nyou know why we wake up with these bruises it is not because we have\nbeen hurt it is because consciously it is to alert us or let us know\nwe have had contact whatever happened it is for us to remember it okay so\nthis guy shows me the suction cups on the ends of his fingers and i am\nholding his hand like oh was that cool almost like first love it was wonderful and i would do it again and again and again but\nafter a while he said now\nit is time for you to learn from someone else so i started going from being to being to being and eventually began\nhaving contact with the masters the\nmasters are not the people that tell you what to do and to worship\nthem the masters are here to tell us who we are how important we\nare all equal there is no greater than and lesser than another sananda ashtar mary \u2013 all of them are beings now let us fast-forward a little bit and in 2003 one day while\ntaking a pot-throwing class trying to learn how to use clay they\nwere overbooked and they did not have enough wheels and so i sat\nthere most of the time just kind of waiting my turn and i started\nworking with the clay and the next thing i knew i had sculptured an\net baby hybrid let\nme tell you the people in this class were not open-minded like you\nguys they thought it was freaky creepy and some of the people even\ntold the teacher do\nyou mind if you tell her not to make these in this room so\ni would make them in my home and i began having conscious contact\nwith these beings where they were telepathically i would be\nsculpturing and they would tell me how to make the eyes the nose the head by the way one time i made the nose too big and they said he\ndoes not have a bob hope nose ooo or\nthey would say the\neyes do not bulge that much okay or the\neyes are more slanted what\ni did not realize right off the bat they did tell me\ntelepathically when\nyou make these beings they carry our frequency i was only allowed to make beings that work with the light one\ntime i decided i wanted to make a reptilian but not the good\nreptilians you know there are good and there are bad and there is\nnothing wrong with the bad truly the bad ones are just as important\nas the good ones because how do we know what love is if we have not\nexperienced what hate is or what pain is if we have not\nexperienced not being in pain believe me when you have a lot of\nbroken bones you know what pain is so we learn through experiencing the differences they\nwould never allow me to make negative ones and one day i saw this\npicture of a reptilian that people said \u201craped women bad\nreptilian i thought well\nhe is awfully pretty i think i will make him anyway i\nstarted making him and all of a sudden the beings said to   no we do not want you to do that one i\nsa but\ni\nwant to they\nsa we\ndo not want you to now they speak in a collective by the way i\nsa i\ndo not care what we want i want to find out if i am an\nartist because i do not make these by myself you work through\nme to make these sculptures i want to find out if i even have any\nartistic talent so\nthey shut their mouths and i made a reptilian he was gorgeous and\nhe was perfect and i was so proud i pushed him off into the middle\nof this big big six-foot-long island grabbed some more clay and\nstarted making another sculpture and the next thing i know the\nsculpture goes flying off of the counter smashed face down unrecognizable and the message was that\nwhich you make you bring that frequency into the world okay i got it only benevolent beings now what i want you to do because when they told me their frequency is\nin these beings these sculptures they told me in fact they even\ncalled me a \u201cstraw i am a straw through which the fluid\nflows so when i do hands-on they come through me and whatever\nsculpture i am making they put their frequency in them and the\nlonger i work on them the more empowered they are for\nan example one time actually this last february when i was in\nlaughlin anybody go to laughlin okay good a few of you guys\nwent to laughlin to the international ufo congress i\ngot home at midnight and i was so tired i rode with another person or i had another person ride with me we were getting things out\nand he was not paying attention and one of the sculptures a\nzeta kind of a green looking zeta fell out of my car and broke and\nso i thought oh\ndarn i have to fix it well it took me an hour and a half to fix it and i had to hold the\nhead onto the neck and then i had to rebuild the neck and\nblah-blah-blah a\nparanormal matrix\ncame out to my house to film me making sculptures and to show\npictures of all my sculptures and by the way this is going to be\non tv i have not yet got a date for the release but they will\nbe showing this on tv as they are filming all the sculptures all of a sudden they came to the one that had broken that i had\nrepaired because\ni put in extra time repairing it it had so much frequency their\ncamera which had a stabilizer in it went nuts it was vibrating and let me tell\nyou everyone there but one man who was an agnostic everyone there there was eight crew people filming this were \u201cbelievers they had never seen anything like this ever i have\nhad people take dowsing rods and literally set a sculpture down and\ntake a dowsing rod and go right up to the sculpture and when they get\nfrom 10\nto\n15 feet if it is a sculpture that was broke that i had to\nrepair they get 20 feet away and those rods would open wide up\nbecause of the kind of frequency they have i\nthought they were joking when somebody told me that they used dowsing\nrods on it so i started doing it (and i will be darned if i\ndid not forget my dowsing rods but they open up wide up i\nwas just absolutely blown away and going whoa that is okay that is cool meditation exercise now those who have sculptures what i want you to do first of all i want\neveryone i want you to relax take deep breaths big big\ndeep breaths just totally relax and allow yourselves to be one and\nthen i want you to as you are holding the sculptures or if you\nhave a necklace hold the necklace and imagine that piece as if it is\nan extension of your arms and hold it allow it to become part of\nyou allow\nyourself to feel the energy feel the energy you may feel tingling you may feel pulsing it may even speak to you do not be\nsurprised if it is telepathically speaking to you feel the\nenergy of\nthem and while you are doing that i am going to tell you a\nlittle story last\nmay a year ago may when i was doing a conference in alamo nevada the day before i left to do the conference i was told to sit down at\nthe computer and to write and all of a sudden this was what came\nout the\nsource was just was\nall that is the source knew all was all and the source decided\nthat it wanted to know what it was like not to be all not to know\nall so the source made selves and the source made worlds for selves\nto live on and each self would have a container that it would be\nallowed to live on these planets source selves are the light the\nsoul-light connected to the source i\ndo not have time to do a regression tonight but i will tell you\nthis that i did a regression with these people i took them down and\ni took them to another planet and i started introducing one by one each of the beings to them then i took them from the planet and the\nplanet disappeared and all of the beings throughout the universe\nthat i had introduced them to they all were holding hands then all\nof a sudden i had their bodies their containers disappear and all\nthat was left was their source their source-light the soul within now\nimagine a circle of lights now imagine off in the distance in outer\nspace comes a big big bright light and it is moving quickly\nthrough the universe and it comes down in the center of all these\nlittle light beings the big light is the source-creator the source itself all that is and all the little lights that\nrepresent the souls of the beings throughout the universe are all\nsource-selves and the light expels umbilical cords that goes out to\neach and every light so it looks almost like a wheel with the spokes\nin the middle we\nare all connected to those of the universe and you have contact with\nthem it is simply by releasing the container going within connecting with the source the creator of all and opening up your\nheart to communicate with your brothers and sisters throughout the\nuniverse we\nare all here for our lessons we can be teachers to one another and\nwe can be soul brothers and sisters and share our lessons but in\nevery lifetime we have a certain set of lessons that allows us to\ngrow spiritually and that is what life is about we are on this\nplanet earth at this time one of the most precious times ever in\nwhich we actually get to experience the release of an old world and\nthe bringing in of a new world and\nwe get to be those people who start the new world over that what\nwe\nwant to see in the new world is that which we need to be now when we\nbegin living what we want to see in the world we change the world now\ni want you to feel the energy inside these sculptures and let the\nfeeling of that energy move into your heart chakra connect with it they are asking you to feel their love allow that love to\npenetrate your heart and exchange love with them give the love back give them love several\nmoments of silence meditation ends]\n\n\n\n\nwhen\nyou go home at night or even tonight here if you are staying at\nthe hotel close your eyes and meditate and do this connect with the\nsource connect with the beings and say i\nam no longer afraid my heart is open i am ready for contact the\nonly thing you need to know that is going to help you through\nanything and everything in this world that we will face or are about\nto face is unconditional love and living the light if\nyou think there is a chance that somebody may be of a negative\nenergy you can dissipate any negativity simply by enveloping them in\nthe light and sending them unconditional love i\nhave been attacked many times by the illuminati and by the\ngovernment the secret government who because i know who i am and\nhave spoken up about how we are all connected they have tried\nto take me out there\nliterally have been times the illuminati have actually tried to take\nme out by causing me to one time i woke up after being drugged by\nthem and they had injected me with a serum that caused an aneurism in\nmy brain but right before my brain was to pop all of a sudden i\ncried out for my guides for my beings and said if\nyou want me to finish my mission then heal me instantly i was out cold and an hour later i woke up \u2013 i was\ncompletely healed anyone\nthat does anything negative to you if you return negativity with\nnegativity anger hatred resentment any of these things this is\nwhat is gonna happen you are going to empower them why\nnot keep your power we can empower ourselves with unconditional love\nand enveloping the light around all those people that we want to\neither to teach to empower themselves or that we want to diffuse them\nof their negativity i\nhad a friend that told me that when she stayed over at my house one\ntime she woke up in the middle of the night and there was a\nreptilian carrying me \u2013 i was out cold \u2013 carrying me\naway she\nwalked up to him and he was a big one and she said to h  put\nher down now and\nthe being telepathically sa  what\nare you gonna do about it and\nshe sa  i am\ngoing to love you and immediately he put me down darkness\ncannot handle the light let us be in the light and let us\nchange this world let us take our power back you\nwant to take your power back everybody want to take your power back let us do it now let us do it now how many of you would\nlike to have contact all right that is\nwonderful i am so happy call\nthem to you open your hearts to them give them love they may not\ndo it the same moment you do that it took me three weeks of begging but then it is like i have contact all the time sometimes we\nhave to beg a little and sometimes we just have to be patient but\nnever stop giving them love for when they feel your love they say okay they are ready okay oh boy okay i am not sure if i am seeing this correct what time do you guys have okay i guess we have got a little\nbit more time i\nwant to ask audience\nmember (am you did what colors did you see there was a deep purple alternating with almost like a tan and then\nit went white just with my eyes closed oh yeah i have been holding it for did you feel anything did you feel any vibration or anything i did not i did not and then it went completely black and one my challenges i can never make a black screen but this was\na completely black screen you know like your blouse or my shirt and then white came back again ams\n\u2013 several voic  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n okay let us see lavender was your first ams\n\u2013 several voic  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n okay lavender represents your spiritual self you are talking about the third chakra yes yes it is but it also represents wisdom you are being\ndownloaded with some wisdom and what were the other colors white white is the highest color of ascension anybody have any\nexperiences while holding the sculptures okay what was your\nexperience i was meditating i felt like pulsating in my head vibration just\na vibration in my head right\nhere it was like pulsating okay who else felt it and light and light all right anybody else violet\nand bluish violet\nand bluish and vibration vibration excellent oh good i get a lot of people tell me they start feeling vibration i sent sculptures to two different women who had experienced a\nnefilim\n child\nand\nboth of them when they picked the packages out of their post box it\nvibrated like that yes and you pulsation that is common ooooh wow communication there she felt like she wanted to cry wow that is beautiful that\nparticular one is the anabua the anabua have cried for the planet earth because of the abuse that\nhumanity has created so the anabua are all about nature they have\nagreed at this time at the end of the old world to come here to\nactually give us they are going to check out as we are\nmoving into stargates and so forth they are here as well to watch\nthe way to let us know if there is any danger ahead and so\nforth anybody else yes oh\ngood she had a broken hip at one time that you have had surgery\non is that right and she felt a healing ache now\ni will say this a few people have actually experienced healing there is a woman who recently was given a sculpture it was the\nandromedan\nchild and what happened with the andromedan child she now uses it she is\na reiki master actually it opens up peoples chakras and has\ndispersed all negative energy anything attaching to people i\nreceive emails from a lot of people who have experiences it\nlooks like we are going to have to end this i really apologize i was really hoping we could have a much longer time maybe i can\nfind a time tomorrow if kerry and bill you know are able to fit me\nin where we can sit down and talk some more because it is yeah maybe during lunch break i am not sure if they are going\nto do that other thing at lunchtime but i will talk to them the\nthing we need to be cognizant of pardon yeah the thing we need to be cognizant of we need to just relax to\nstop judging and start loving we need to be cognizant that we are\nall connected to the universe we take our turn from planet to\nplanet learning the lessons we have chosen what it all boils\ndown to is when we leave our physical container we get to go back to\nthe spiritual plane and communicate with one another the lessons\nwe have learned when\ni gave up my fear and learned to love these beings oh my gosh i\ncannot get enough love it is like sometimes it is\nhard being in my body it is wonderful oh\nno i am allowed to sell them i am not allowed to talk\npeople into buying them you may buy them if you are really\nconnected to one and you feel drawn to it you may buy it but what\ni am saying is i cannot talk anybody into ever buying one for\nthey know who their owner is and you will know i have\nhad people walk past my booth when i have been at shows and\nthey have turned around and they had go i am\nsorry what i will\nlook at them and   i\ndid not say anything and\nthey  ohhh your sculpture\u2019s talking to me i have\nhad people actually see the sculpture and you have to be very\nopen-minded and not afraid they have actually seen for example mary i\nmean call her \u201cmary she is the blue lady the\nplaque of the blue lady\n\u2013 she\ncarries the mary energy and isis energy i have\nhad people tell me that the plaque actually became an entire tall\nbeing and actually came to her the night she got it then it came\nback a second time that night and brought two other beings from other\nplanets and said well if you are open enough for me here\u2019s some others that\nwould like to meet you that\nis a tall\nwhite charles hall wrote books the millennium\nseries [millennium\nhospitality a trilogy about his experience while in the air force meeting with\ntall whites they literally have come to this planet numerous times they have for hundreds and hundreds of years actually many of them\nstill live here yes i\novercame my fear when i got doggone tired of being a victim when i\nsaid i\nam so tired of them coming and getting me when i do not want\nthem to and when i do not know what they are doing they\nwill not let me remember and\nfinally i said i am\ngoing to find out and the only way i can find out is to give up my\nfear and say okay guys why me and they came to me finally after three weeks of begging and i will\ntell you what after i started experiencing them i do not\ncare they\ncome to me a lot i have even does anybody have the ant\npeople\nplaque anybody took the ant people plaque ah\nyes let me tell you the story about the ant people i did not\nbelieve that the old world was going to end and there was going to be\na new world i kept thinking enh makes\nsound of skepticism] you know i had\nheard about what happens in 2000 and so forth so\nin 2006 one night i woke up in the middle of the night potty break\ntime and got up to go to the bathroom and i noticed that there was\nan ant person\nabout five feet tall standing beside my bed as i looked around there was another one by the fireplace and another one by the\nstereo and i am going whoa what a dream i cannot this is not real i\ngot up to go to the bathroom and i put cold water on my face slapped\nmyself a few times almost slapped myself silly and i came out and i\nsaid okay if they are real they are going to be there when i come\nback i\ncame back and by god they were real i did not know who in the\nworld they were so i sculptured them anybody know of chris o\u2019brien yes chris o\u2019brien the\nmysterious valley\nand so forth he had spent i think it was six years living\nwith the hopi interestingly enough about chris o\u2019brien i will\ntell you he thought i was a phony when he saw all the sculptures i\ndid he said you cannot tell me you have had experience with these\nbeings i will not believe you and\nwhen i pulled out the ant people sculpture (i actually made an entire\nsculpture he goes oh\nmy god the ant people i\nsa  the\nwhat he\ngo  the\nant people and\ni sa  who\nare they he\ngo  well look it up and he gives me this website to go to and i read  the hopi\ntalking about the ant people so\nwhen i came back from that seminar i meditated one night and i said okay i have very open-minded i would like to go down into the inner\nworld inner earth to their den and see what their den looks like and\noh my god what a joy they literally have claws kind of like crab\nclaws on their feet and hands and they have antennas now anybody\nknow why the antennas why they have antennas no they have these antennas do you remember my\nfavorite martian are you old enough for that well what i did not realize was the antennas were because they pick\nup frequency they know us not by our face nor by our name but by our frequency my\nbeings told me our soul when we were created our soul has a\nfrequency that is our identity we carry no matter how many\nlifetimes no matter what planet we live on we always carry that\nfrequency they can find us whenever they need us they zoom in on\nus and\nwhat happens is the frequency intensifies as we become more and more\nspiritual okay it is wonderful the\nant people their only purpose is to bring us to inner earth when\nthose who are meant to start the new world over again after mother\nearth has shaken herself free of \u201cthe fleas i\nactually had a communication once with mother earth and i thought whoa now this is really pushing the button there i\nhad no idea mother earth was a sentient being all\nof a sudden she wakes me up in the middle of the night and she says i\nhave to cleanse myself for humanity has been very angry very\nnegative very hateful very greedy and jealous although\nmany of you are ready to graduate we are going through a\ngraduation for spiritual beings\n\u2013 we are\ngoing to graduate from the lower density so she said during this\ngraduation she must shake herself clean of all this negativity and\nthere will be a new group of students coming to earth many of us\nhave chosen to go to the new world and start the world over some\nwill go back to the ships where they came from others will go back\nto other planets and some might just be guides for others you know as we have guides that speak to us we may choose just to kind of\nrelax hang back and just be a guide and talk to people\ntelepathically  like i have had the fortune of having so any other questions yes she\nwants to know if it is true about the ascension and will earth\ngo into a fourth or fifth density you\nknow your truth is there in your heart but i am going to tell\nyou what they told me and then i am going to tell each and every\none of you if you want to know the truth connect to the source\nwithin for your truth belongs to you no matter what anyone says or\nno matter what you read your truth is yours okay we only share\nwhat we think is our truth okay what\nthey told me and what was interesting is i was driving one evening\nor afternoon with john mack\u2019s assistant maria and i was\nexplaining the new earth i was told that as an atom splits so too\nwill planet earth split and become two worlds at\nthe moment that i told her this a rock dropped from a truck and hit\nmy windshield and i had two big overlapping round holes in my\nwindshield is not it an expensive lesson but it got the point\nacross she understood then but it showed the two earths splitting i have a photograph of this i thought it was worth photographing but\nwhat i was told was that earth will always be a third-dimensional\nplanet but there is a new earth that will be a higher density planet\nwhere those who have already learned their lessons and have graduated\ncan go and start the world over with higher-conscious beings the\nother earth is always there as a school for the new class of people of beings coming in that are ready for their lessons so it is\nkind of like being in school it is\nkind of like we are going to graduate high school this year or this lifetime excuse me this lifetime it might be this year who knows 2012 may come sooner than we think so that is\nwhat i understand is going to happen in\na higher dimension he asked where the new earth the higher-density\nearth will be it is going to be in a higher dimension what we\ndo not understand because we are living in a\nthird-dimensional world we have to learn to see outsight the box the new earth is in a much higher dimension than we are now yes we just have to open our minds and to accept whatever they are\nwilling to teach us about this every time i think i know it all\n i find out how much more i need to learn so i say reach\ninside your hearts connect with the source and your answers will be\nthere if\nyou guys have any questions for me feel free at any time to come up\nto my booth and ask them i am going to call it quits now so we\ndo not interfere any more with the music that is going to\nbe performing here so i hope you all enjoy the evening thank you so\nmuch click here for the workshop video\n\n\u00a0luca scantamburlo nice pronunciation very good you interviewed bob dean the former sergeant-major that is right and he used an expression that i like so much about extraterrestrial affairs about possible extraterrestrial presence in our solar system he said this this story is dynamite i perfectly agree with him this story is dynamite because if nibiru does exist first of all it is a threat to all of us because its orbit if it is the orbit described in the ancient text in mesopotamia is a cometary obit so it means that at a certain point this planet will be close to the sun and close to the other planets and if its mass is bigger than earth mass we can have a lot of problems also because of - i can imagine - this planet has a magnetic field as a matter of fact there are there is a strange behavior in the solar activity and for a strange coincidence - but i do not believe in the coincidence - this solar cycle the solar cycle 24 will have its peak its maximum in the year 2011 2012 and this does not come from me it does not come from the jesuit it does not come from barbato it comes from scientific forecasts made by nasa employees i have to ask what did the jesuit say in terms of hard information about this planetoid\u2019s orbit and its size and its nature whether it is a rocky planet or a big gas giant like saturn or is it the planet was described by zecharia sitchin so we have an atmosphere and we have the possibility to have life on the surface it is the planet described by the sumerians that is what the jesuit said yes it is nibiru but he said more about the space program that they would have that the vatican by secrecy would have we are talking about the siloe space program the siloe space program would be part of the bigger one and its name is kerigma kerigma is a greek word it means \u201cproclamation annunciation click here for part 2 \u00a0\n\n\nintroduction\nby jordan maxwell jordan\nmaxwell (jm we are very fortunate to have robert \u2013 bob\n\u2013 dean with us because bob dean is really an inspiration to\neveryone bob\ndean whether you know it or not kind of dropped out of sight for a\nwhile and has not been doing too many conferences and not very\nmuch radio i talked with him recently and he confided in me that he\nhas not felt much like talking because he is been doing so\nmuch of it i\nfelt the same way because i have been kind of quiet myself since\n9/11 i became very disenchanted with the country i live in since\n9/11 but seeing robert dean coming back into the speaking circuit\nwas an inspiration to me i am\nvery inspired to see my dear friend robert dean decide to come back\nand begin to talk with us again because i believe what he has to say and just his appearance just his person is enough to inspire many\npeople so that is why i asked if i could have the pleasure of\nannouncing him my dear friend robert dean i call him bob so he will be here any moment if you will take your seats robert\ndean and i go back a long time back in mesa arizona back in the\nvery early \u201990s i met bob dean for the first time at a\nconference he was speaking there and afterward he was so gracious i\nwas very impressed with bob dean and he invited me to go out to\ndinner with him i was nervous \u2013 i am in the company of someone\ni admire \u2013 but he was very encouraging to me and he was very\neasy to befriend so i have been inspired by bob dean over the years we just talked\nrecently and as i said he told me that he has decided to begin to\nspeak to the public again which has actually inspired me to do the\nsame applause shouts whistles]\n\n\n\nthere is\nso much i would like to be able to say that i have been quite\nliterally afraid to say in public the bush regime frightened me scared me and if you know what was really going on with the bush\nregime it would scare you too it was a frightening presence on\namerican soil the bush regime what\nwe have got now is not much better now the next speaker up is bob dean 4:02\n- overtalk \u2013 bob dean and bill ryan can be heard discussing\ntechnical stuff in the foreground he is been an inspiration to me he is back now on the speaking\ncircuit speaking as bob and i do almost all speakers at these conferences will tell\nyou that it is not an easy being a speaker at conferences there\nare many downsides to doing this kind of work it is  sometimes and costs a lot it costs you in\nrelationships because you are on the road a lot and it is\nnot easy to speak to a  audience believe me but there are some upsides to being a speaker there are some perks and\nnice things that you get from speaking one\nis that you meet some very interesting and fascinating people and\nyou become friends with some very lovely and decent people and bob\ndean is one of the finest men i have ever met i\nwant to be able to introduce bob as not only my dear friend but one\nwho has not only impressed me but inspired me as i said to you\nbefore now i am saying it for his benefit for him to hear because\nhe has come back into the speaking circuit and began to talk with us\nagain \u2013 i think it would be a loss if he did not \u2013 i\nhave been inspired to come back into the speaking circuit and begin\ntalking again so without further ado the man i am introducing i love and admire and a fascinating man and i would suggest you listen closely because he is got a lot to talk about that he knows first-hand robert \u2013 bob  dean applause shouts whistles \u2013 bob hugs jordan as he comes on stage bob\ndean (bd the check is in the mail jordan as long as it does not bounce that is the main thing it will not bounce okay thank you presentation\nby bob dean i was in the back of the room back there and i did not realize\nthat this scoundrel here bill ryan was going to come up with an\noverhead projector so i had to rush up to my room and grab my\ntransparencies so i have got a few pictures to show\nto you that i think you might find interesting i\nwant to say it is an honor to be introduced by someone like\njordan he is one of the foremost scholars of our time and i\nhonor and respect him and as he said we are old friends we go\nback a long way i\nalso want to say a word or two about the young man who was up here on\nthis podium before i showed up here rich dolan is very special he is\nprobably one of the foremost historians of our time and i strongly\nurge you \u2013 encourage you \u2013 to not only buy and read his\nfirst volume but get the second because i am waiting\nexpectantly for volume three that\nyoung man has pulled the cover back from this cover-up and the\nscandal that we have been living through for the last 60 70\nyears and i take my hat off to him i have\nknown him for some time and i am so encouraged by young men like\nhim that are picking up and going with this program because as i am\nsure all of you know i am a member of the old guard and we are\ndiminishing daily \u2013 literally not a week or a month goes by\nthat i do not hear that some of my old cronies are gone they are\nnot gone they have just crossed back they are home now but i miss\nthem and i am gratified to see some of the young men coming\nalong that are filling the space for us i am\nalso gratified to look out and see you guys because you are the\nreason i am here i do not speak publicly much anymore i\nfind it inconvenient i hate like hell to travel in airplanes i\ngot back from spain here at the end of july and i had to go to bed\nfor a damn week then\ni went through kennedy airport and i was outraged when i looked\naround at kennedy it is a national disgrace i mean it is\ndirty the broken furniture the service is rotten the restrooms are\nfilthy and most of them are closed it is terrible to walk\nthrough kennedy having gone through the airport at barcelona and\nseeing new and modern and oh\nmy god those spaniards are really something else they put on a show\nthere in barcelona the last week in july that was outstanding 1,500 people showed up and they had standing room it\nwas a hell of a good conference and i was honored to be invited\n steven greer steven bassett who i will touch upon\nbriefly in a few minutes i was gratified by the spaniards \u2013\nthey are great hosts and they are very enlightened and very\ninterested in this subject as\nmany of you i am sure know this subject has been my favorite\nsubject now for over the last 20 years i have been on this\njourney for 45 years but i have been speaking publicly for the\nlast 20 i\nspeak bluntly openly and i violate my national security oath every\ntime i open my mouth and i plan to violate my national\nsecurity oath tonight but\nagain a special thanks for you guys because i would not be here\nif it were not for you i am so encouraged by the people i\nmeet at these conferences because not only are you open-minded but\nyou are enlightened and you are enthused because i think\nyou have learned as i have that this subject is in my opinion the greatest story in human history because\nit is the story of human history we are\nnot alone guys and we have never been alone we are members of an\ninfinite universe filled with infinite intelligent life we have had\nan intimate interrelationship with several advanced extraterrestrial\nintelligences now for oh at least 10,000 years the\nevidence is pretty overwhelming that at least one perhaps two of\nthose different groups had a hand in engineering the human genome\nover 100,000 years ago that evidence is literally overwhelming now we are going to touch upon a whole bunch of stuff and i want\nyou to understand i have come to the point in my life where i have\nbecome almost\nsympathetic to the government for keeping the lid on this thing they\ndo not know how to lift the lid on this subject they do not\nknow how to lift the lid on pandora\u2019s\nbox because when they\nlift the lid just a little tiny bit \u2013 boom\n\u2013 the whole damn thing is going to come out and nobody\nin government is prepared for that because the story is so damn big i\nknow that many of you \u2013 probably most of you \u2013 are aware\nof the famous brookings report nasa gave a contract to the brookings\ninstitute in the late \u201950s and the basic point was simply\nthis try to find out \u2013 what\nshould we do if we in the future should encounter advanced\nextraterrestrial intelligence they\nworked on this thing for three years published it in \u201961 delivered it to congress in \u201961 and they concluded as a result\nof this study that if we should indeed at some point run into\nadvanced extraterrestrial intelligence it would probably be a good\nidea to keep your mouths shut and not tell the masses of people now margaret mead\nwas on the committee and she had had experiences in the south pacific with primitive\nsocieties where they had been confronted by our advanced culture and\nthose primitive societies shriveled and died the conclusion of the\nbrookings study was that if we indeed would encounter advanced\nextraterrestrial intelligence we probably should not tell the\nmasses of people because sociologically theologically scientifically it would be a damn disaster so they published that study and it literally\nbecame national policy it is one of the major reasons why the\nlid has been kept down so tightly on this thing for so long as\ni said it is not simply that we are being visited by guys\nfrom other planets it is not simply that we are being\nvisited by guys from other star systems nor are we being visited you know from other galaxies good god those are all given they\nalso learned \u2013 and they knew that when i retired in \u201976 \u2013\nthat we are being visited by guys from other dimensions they are\ncoming through portals apparently they create\nportals apparently and they are coming and going from other\ndimensions the more advanced societies we have encountered have been\nmultidimensional it is\nno wonder that our ancestors deified these dudes back 10,000 years\nago i think there are people today who would deify them if they\nwere to confront them and see what they can do and understand where\nthey are from and what their capabilities are you would think\nthat it was almost godlike to have that kind of technology so over the years i have come to a point where i have almost\nbegun to be patient and tolerate of the government\u2019s lies \u2013\nbut not quite not quite i am so fed up with\ngovernment lies i do not even know where to start applause whistles] you too huh last\nweek i was over at the bay area conference and a couple of people\nsaid what have we learned\nin the last year since you were here i\nsaid well we learned\nthat the american people elected a black president is not\nthat pretty damned impressive who would have ever thought that the\namerican people could elect a black president listen guys i am from the last century that is dynamite to me my\nheart goes out to that kid because he is likeable he is\npersonable and he is bright and i wish him well i hope to\nhell he can pull it off he is got so much  damn much  on\nhis plate but he are not going to disclose this subject any time soon because\nhe is not ready for this i do not even think he is\nbeen briefed yet on what this is all about you\nall know the story what happened to jimmy carter who promised\neverybody that when he was elected he was going to release all of\nthe ufo information he\ngot into washington and he got his national security briefing he\nwalked out his briefing with tears in his eyes apparently the\ndirector of central intelligence said mr president you do not have a high-enough clearance sir to have\naccess to all this material now can you believe that the director of central intelligence says also sir you do not have a need to know and\npoor old jimmy just he wilted and as a result he never said boo\nabout anything during his four years in office promises went down\nthe tube who\nwas the director of central intelligence some guy by the name of\ngeorge herbert walker bush now we are beginning to put pieces together here the puzzle is\nbeginning to form here who is sitting on top of this damn\ncover-up oh my now i want to share something with you here the guys in spain asked me\ncontinually when is there\ngoing to be disclosure good god you guys it is been years and\nyears and years now we expect the u.s government to expose this when you going to do it and\ni said guys hold your breath it are not going to happen any time soon because it is too big a story and\nthen of course greer and bassett were there at the conference and well let me give you a small parable here i have got a\nlittle parable i have prepared it is called the\nthree stevens and the apocalypse that\nsounds religious enough does not it the\nthree stevens and the apocalypse i\nwant to now touch upon that word apocalypse because that is another word that ticks me off i am so pissed\noff at the number of people who misuse that word most\nof my fundamentalist friends \u2013 and i have a few still yet after all these years \u2013 keep talking about the four horsemen of\nthe apocalypse oh my god we are doomed you\nknow war famine plague pestilence \u2013 the four horsemen are riding for\ngod\u2019s sake the four horsemen have been riding for 10,000 damn\nyears but most of them never really grasp the meaning of\nthe word apocalypse it is a greek word and it has several meanings the\nrevealing the uncovering and the disclosing of what the truth and\nyou are living in the middle of the apocalypse you have\nbeen living in it for the last 10 to 20 years and you are going\nto be living in it for another 20 or 30 years the revealing the\nuncovering and the disclosing is taking place as you sit here and as\nyou breathe it is taking place now but i got into this little tangle with greer and bassett i respect them\nboth they are decent guys i have known steven greer for\nyears they\nkeep hammering away they have these conferences in washington and\nthey keep prodding the congress and they keep prodding the\ngovernment you have\ngot to have a committee you have got to reveal this material you have got to tell the american people the truth blah-blah-blah and\nthe government pardon me but they give them that middle finger you know in the air excuse me ladies i am sorry that is\nrather rude but the government does that to greer and bassett and\nthey go back and they say well maybe next week maybe next month oh a new administration oh we have got podesta who worked for clinton we have got panetta who worked for clinton and we have got a young president who i\nbelieve is honest and transparent and is going to tell us the truth i\nsaid to bassett and greer do not\nhold your breath guys it are not going to happen that new\npresident are not going to put that on his plate not if he can\navoid it because he is not going to get the whole story right\nnow he is got so damn much piled up outside of his oval office he can hardly get in and out of it and you all know the story on that now who is the other steven ah a young man in hollywood \u2013\nspielberg now where does he fit into this thing well when i was asked about disclosure is\nit going to happen and i\nsay no yes yes no no yes and everybody\u2019s\nsaying what the hell\u2019s\nhe talking about disclosure\nhas been under way for some time steven spielberg made a bunch of\nmovies he made e.t which i think most\nof you have probably seen that was for the kids he\nmade another one called close\nencounters of the third kind and that was for the big guys and then he made a television series\ncalled taken which was dynamite they\ntell me  and i have got this from sources that i trust  that\nhe is got two separate programs in the mill another movie and\nperhaps another tv series that he is working on that they are\ngoing to come up with hopefully in the next few years now these movies as they come out affect people there is not a\none of you here in the audience that was not you know affected\nby e.t it was cute it was a kid\u2019s story really and i think there is\nnot a one of you who was not touched at the closing scene of\nclose encounters of the\nthird kind when the guys\npiled aboard that ship and off it went and\nthen taken which i think ran for a number of weeks i cannot remember how\nmany episodes it was voice\nfrom audien  twenty b\n twenty good god yes well that is a major program it was\npowerful well written and dynamite it had so much classified\nmaterial in it but most people i do not think ever realized\nthat they were looking at classified material then\nthere was another guy out in hollywood who i got to know a number of\nyears ago i was honored to be invited to be a speaker at the mensa\nregional conference in orange county i was honored to be invited and\ni went and spoke to the mensa\ncrowd the\nguest of honor at that particular regional conference was a dude by\nthe name of chris carter he was the producer/director of the\nx-files as most of you know after\npresentations and all and drinks you know i got him aside and\nwe are standing there sipping away \u2013 fruit juice of\ncourse i pulled him over and i says chris you got to level with me i\nsays i have been\nwatching your program here now for some time i think it had been underway for about six years at that time\n\u2013 and i said it is\nimpressive some of your stories are dynamite some of your stories\nare not worth the powder to blow them away but it is a\npretty decent series but i says i\nwant to ask you something there are three incidents three episodes\nof your x-files that i happen to know are highly classified\ngovernment secrets i have\nbeen on the inside i knew these things to be classified and here\nthey are i am seeing them on the x-files for\ngod\u2019s sake and\ni says how the hell do\nyou guys do that he\nsays oh i have got\nsome great writers and\ni said bullshit nonsense poppycock you\nknow what is it my good old british ancestors balderdash i\nsaid you cannot tell\nme that your writers have come up with classified material that\nthey have dramatized that are right on and are still classified he\nlooked around and he got a sheepish grin on his face and he says well yeah we have\nbeen getting some story ideas from a variety of sources i\nsays where he\nsays well you know i\ncannot really say but we have been getting some promotional\nideas from different people i\nsaid well you are\nright on and i laid them\nout for him these three particular cases that were classified and\nstill are classified and\nall he did he looked at me sheepishly and he grinned and he says you are not seen\nnothing yet stay tuned and it ran for another two years but\nthere again is what i wanted to point out to you is what spielberg\nwas involved in what chris carter is involved in and what some of\nthe directors and writers of the stargate\nseries and the star trek\nseries in from time to time little bits and pieces of material are injected\ninto those story lines that are not fiction they are not\nscience fiction they are science fact but they are introduced in such a way that you do not know\nit \u2013 you do not recognize it it hits you at what is\nknown as the subliminal\nlevel when\ni tell you that disclosure are not going to happen then i tell\nyou that disclosure is happening now i am referring to that\nsubliminal educational program that is underway that you are all\nbeing subjected to you are getting the uncovering and the\nrevealing and the disclosure in subtle ways that you do not even\nrecognize and\nyou are going to get more of it because the program apparently is rather successful and the guys who put it together are rather\npleased at your responses you are going to be getting more\nstories and you are going to get some stories that are so far\nout you are going to say to yourself good\ngod that could not happen but good god it is\nhappening ben\nrich before he retired from lockheed martin made some comments to a\nnumber of people there california we are in\ncalifornia  forgive me i am from arizona i baked my gourd in\nphoenix for the last six to eight months and i lose it sometimes this\nprogram is underway it is subtle it is continuous and it\nis subliminal education it is affecting you  it is\naffecting everybody and you are going to see more of it they\ndid it in the stargate\nseries they did it in star\ntrek \u2013 kirk jean\nluke piccard and the rest of them from the enterprise they slip little bits and pieces in from time to time where you\nthink ooo is not\nthat exciting is not that way out guys it is not that way out ben rich said before he retired  he\nsays we are 100\nyears ahead of establishment science this\nis a guy who had a right to know and he had a need to know and he was\nin the inside of the program we are\n100 years ahead of establishment science\n\u2013 the stuff that normally is understood by guys in\nuniversities you know on the street rich says we are 100\nyears beyond that and\nhe said you know we could take e.t home now the movie was out at about that time and you know the story the little dude says e.t go home e.t wants to go home rich says we can take\ne.t home now ben rich has been dead for ten years for god\u2019s sake i\nknew another lockheed martin scientist who has passed away a guy by\nthe name of david froning who worked with lockheed martin for almost\n30 years i invited david to speak at a conference in phoenix some\nyears back wendelle stevens\nand i put on a program and we got hold of froning we\nknew he was brilliant and we knew he had been on the inside of\nresearch at lockheed martin for so long we got david to come down\nand speak at our conference there in phoenix and he was getting up\nin years \u2013 david\u2019s gone home now he was getting up in\nyears and he shared some things with us froning\nsaid you know bob he said i have been\nretired now for 10 years he says before i retired i was in the advanced systems division of lockheed martin and we were\ndealing with something we called modified field propulsion\n\u2013 variable field he said of\ncourse he began to lose me immediately i did not know what he\nwas talking about matter antimatter conversion exotic field tension wormholes he\nsaid it will modify time\nand space and he says we have had transluminal\nflight for over 30 years and\ni had to stop again and i says hold\nit transluminal hyperluminal flight i says you are\ntalking about faster-than-light for gosh sakes he\nsaid yeah we have\nhad it now for 30 years now this was from david froning who\u2019d spent the biggest chunk\nof his life as an advanced systems engineer for lockheed martin then\nwe get the material from ben rich and somebody said to rich he\nsaid man what the hell\nare you really talking about he\ngoes to the blackboard \u2013 his\nbig\n\nfor\nretirement i think was one of the major hangars over there\n\u2013\nhe goes up and he writes unfunded\nopportunities i\nsay what the hell are you\ntalking about he\ntakes the chalk and he circles u f and o and then he left the\nstage and walked out the door and they are all thinking good\ngod what this man\u2019s lost it here unfunded\nopportunities u-f-o what\nhe was inferring and saying literally in their face yes we have reverse-engineered technology from alien craft and we are\nflying it and it works we can take e.t home now one of the reasons i get so ticked off you have to forgive me\nhere i am getting old i do not have the patience i used\nto have the\nrumor has been going around that i have turned out to be a mean rotten old fart cynical you know grumpy well that is\nnot entirely true i like to think as henry higgens said that i\nhave the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein but i cannot really pull it off i guess i am getting kind of grumpy\nin my old age guys i am getting angry i really am getting angrier every day when i\nthink about the con job that is being pulled on you and\n300-million other americans on a daily basis where they are\nliterally conning you to the point they are taking you to the\ncleaners they are stealing you blind and then they are\nlying to you about it i\nhave a list of i call it my pissed-off list you know when you are old and you are sitting in retirement you\nhave to spend your time doing something so i prepared\nthis list top\nof the list are politicians and i say repeatedly that\nyou guys have the best congress money can buy that bunch of clowns\nin washington who think of themselves call themselves congress \u2013\nthat we should build special prisons for them i am\nserious i think about half of them should be put up in\nfront of a judge and sent off for ten years because they are a\nbunch of damn thieves not\nonly are they molesting children and what the hell the governor\nof north carolina south carolina big scandal \u2013 his\nlove affair is in argentina the hell with his wife and kids his\nlove affair is in argentina and\nthen we have got congressmen who are guilty of the same thing some of them are gay and i am not putting them down because\nthey are gay i am putting them down because they lie about\nit as\ni say guys we have got a mess of clowns back there what was it\nthat will\nrogers said the most permanent ongoing self-continuing program in the world of liars and cheats is\nthe united states congress\n\u2013 and will\u2019s been gone for a long long time so i get my dander up i vent my spleen when i come and talk to guys\nlike you and i will say this to you that the next election for\ncongress and the next one for the president think carefully about\nwhat clowns you want to send off to washington i mean examine them\ncarefully because they are supposed to represent you and\nthey are not doing a very good job of it okay excuse me i do have tendency to ramble a bit because i have got\nso damn much to cover oh\nyes one of the top of my lists is nasa you know that crowd never\na straight answer nasa this\nnewsweek\ncame out a couple of weeks back i am sure most of you may have\nseen it this is a shameful issue this is a shameful article in search of aliens it\nsays and then it says nasa\nis out there looking now while i was in spain the spaniards asked me \u2013 you know just\nas i was going over there we were celebrating 40 years of apollo 11 gee that was something was not it we put a couple of guys on the moon we are\npatting ourselves on the back and we are tooting our little\nhorns was not that\ngreat was not that cool were not we special and\ni had to say to some of my spanish friends over there you\ncould never trust this damn bunch over at nasa they did go to the\nmoon but that was only half the story the story was what they found\nwhen they got there and the story was what the photographs had\ntaken now you probably know this but in case you do not i will tell\nyou again nasa admitted about two years ago i think about two years\nback that they had \u201cinadvertently erased 40 rolls of\nfilm from the apollo program that release went out over the media\nand congress did not say a word \u2013 no peep no poop nothing the media itself they reported it and pffft off\ninto the wind nasa\nsays we inadvertently mistakenly \u2013 gee we are sorry \u2013 we erased 40 rolls\nof film from the apollo program now we are talking about hundreds if not thousands of individual\nphotographs in those 40 rolls they erased them why because they showed what they ran into on the moon they showed what\nthey ran into on the way to the moon they showed what they ran into\nwhen they got there this\nhas got to go we cannot let that out but\nsome nitwit in nasa had forgotten that nasa had given a contract to\nthe japanese space agency back in the \u201960s probably involving\nbig bucks where the japanese \u2013 sharp bunch of guys over there\n\u2013 bought every negative or every shot of every picture taken by\nthe entire apollo program and they have got it in their computers\nin japan and\nnasa evidently forgot that now listen you have to understand something there are damn fine guys in\nnasa there are good scientists there are some fine people working\nthere i am not putting them down i take my hat off to them and\ni respect them the\nones that i am really pissed off at are the administrators the\npolicy makers the politicians they forgot\nthat they had sold all this to japan lo\nand behold i am at a conference in tokyo i was a guest of\njunichi\nyaoi one of the foremost\njapanese researchers and ufo experts i was on national television in\njapan while\ni was there i was provided some photographs taken by nasa and the\napollo program that the japanese space agency has been sitting on top\nof for a long long time and i am about to show you a couple\nright now shouts hoots whistles applause]\n\n\n[reading\ntransparency] okay this is negative nine this is apollo systems\na-13 yeah apollo systems 13 bear with me while i get this thing up\nthere okay this\nphotograph was\ntaken by apollo 13 now you may remember apollo 13 it was the one\nthat never made it to the moon they had a tiny explosion on the way where an oxygen tank blew up and they were barely able to get to the\nmoon go around and barely able to get home but\nthey were not alone on that trip so while they were out and away going and coming they had little windows and they snapped pictures this\nis one picture that was held by the japanese space agency you can\nsee the japanese writing here anyhow this is the moon upper left these two objects here b and c are\nfairly large circular disks of some kind but over here \u2013 \u201ca which is moving into the scene \u2013 here is the positive\nand here is the negative i hope you can all see that this is a circular disk with a dome here\u2019s the moon another\ndisk but this dude is coming into the picture and\nhere we are here\u2019s the photo and here\u2019s the negative\ndown here this object is five\nmiles long so you wonder why nasa is keeping its mouth shut how can they talk\nabout something like that how can they release something like that\nto you an object we encountered on the way to the moon that is\nfive miles long now just give some thought try to consider a technology a culture a\ncivilization that can not only build something like that put it in\nspace put it in orbit around the earth but staff it and man it\nwith how many i\nhad the pleasure of being on a couple of aircraft carriers my son is\na career naval officer spent 14 years on aircraft carriers nimitz-class atomic-powered carriers for\nthose of you who do not know they are impressive they are\n1,000 feet long they have a crew complement of 5,000 men these big\nnuclear nimitz-class\ncarriers have 5,000 guys in their crew they are massive they are gigantic they are unbelievable now we were joking one day about it eric and i \u2013 my son \u2013\nwhat kind of a crew would this dude have with you know five miles what are they doing over there what is their pastime what is their\nfunction what is their purpose and having been on a nimitz\ncarrier a couple of times you know they are very impressive \u2013\nsoda fountains snack bars and all the rest of it to make the guys\ncomfortable and all i anticipated \u2013 i have assumed \u2013\nthat aboard an object out there five miles long you had have\nbowling alleys restaurants theaters you know all kinds\nof entertainment because we have learned over the years that if\nyou are an alien and you are involved in human beings you need\nentertainment so they probably have saunas aboard you know and probably the most\nfavorite pastime i would think is watching human television think\nfor a moment having watched it yourself and all the\nidiotic crap that goes-on on tv and imagine what a bunch of guys\nfrom another star system are thinking they are\nrolling in the aisles probably laughing about these unbelievable\nmonkeys down there they are watching our stories \u2013\ndancing with the stars and they are supposed to think of us as being intelligent and advanced and sophisticated oh my okay this is the first shot here is the second one this\nis negative 10 now that big dude has moved over into the middle of the frame and another\nobject has showed up over here was estimated at being two miles\nlong but this one five miles here is the print and here is the\nnegative it is\nthe same object but it seems to have moved somewhat we are not\ngetting a full side-view like we did in the other picture we are\ngetting it a little elongated and there are a couple of circular\ndisk-like objects here apparently\nit is like a carrier it puts its aircraft out and brings them\nback it is probably a carrier for disks alien disks that we\nfind in our skies all the time but\nagain when you start considering the magnitude of the size and the\nimplications of what it means then you can almost sympathize with\nthe authorities about we\ncannot tell those people these things no no no they are\nnot ready for it no no no hell they\nwere not ready for it they are the ones that were scared\nto death you guys can probably handle it but they cannot shows\nnext photo] ah that was only the beginning of the story over the\nyears i have been fortunate in that i have been lucky in finding\nsmart people in the most unlikely places i am\nspeaking at a conference at the bay area a number of years ago and a\nlittle dude shows up by the name of norman\nbergrun norman retired\nfrom nasa after almost 30 years he was an engineer and a\nphotographic expert and he and a number of others were responsible\nin putting together what they called the voyager\nprogram in\nthe late \u201970s astronomers and guys in nasa had discovered some\nanomalous things happening in the rings of saturn i\nlove that word anomalous things were happening but they did not know what the hell they\nwere they did not know how to explain it so what they did they put together a multimillion dollar program called voyager and they sent voyager\nto the rings of saturn in 1980 when\nvoyager one\ngot in the rings of saturn it began taking pictures the pictures\nwere sent back to nasa and they were astounded \u2013 literally\nastounded they got stuff they did not expect now before i go into detail about these photos i will tell you that\nnorman bergrun a little dude about five feet tall you know pink\ncheeks little bow tie brilliant as hell last year when i saw him\nat the bay area he was 87 i\nhave been unable to reach him i have tried through the phones my wife tried with the computer \u2013 cannot reach norman i\ndo not know whether he is passed over and gone home or\nwhat happened all\ni know is that last year in the bay area i introduced him and they\nmobbed him the little dude had a box of books and after i\nintroduced him he got mobbed and he sold every book he had at $50\nbucks a pop but\nnorman was what i say there are some good folks in nasa honest men\nwho would like to tell you everything they have learned and\neverything they know so anyhow norman after frustration and time passed in 1986 norman\ndecided to blow the whistle and publish the photographs that the\nvoyager one\ntook in the rings of saturn he\ncould not get his book published in the united states wonder\nwhy us publishers would not touch him would not even\ntalk to him the little dude had to go to aberdeen scotland to get\nhis book published and  that is the\ncover of his book ed note titled ringmakers\nof saturn]\n\n\nit\nmay be available you maybe can find a copy if you try here there or wherever i hate to tell you what they might cost now because\nthey are real collector\u2019s items but i was delighted that i was able to discover him and present him to\nthe conference in the bay area last year the response from the\naudience was overwhelming his little face lit up and he gave me a\nbig hug tears in his eyes but he published his book in aberdeen scotland and it is a dynamite book pointing\nto overhead photo] now on the cover this you see here on the right\nis part of the b ring of saturn you know there are a b c a whole\nbunch of rings gigantic saturn\u2019s a giant planet and these\nrings are incredible this\nthing here [indicating close-up\nof the orange dot\non the book cover self-luminous obviously artificial construction obviously under intelligent control because it moves around in the\nrings of saturn they do not know what the hell it is but it is\nlarger than our moon \u2013 an intelligent constructed artificial\nobject larger than our moon moving around throughout the rings of\nsaturn wherever it will go we\nget a picture of it and we do not know what to say we do not\nknow what to do we do not know how to respond bigger than our\nmoon ah that is only part of the story changes\nphoto] here we go this\nis in the a ring\nand the statistics on this will blow your mind this object here is\nan artificially-constructed as norman says nasa\ncalled it an electromagnetic\nvehicle that dude is\n2,000 miles long over 450 miles in diameter but 2,000 miles long and\nhere\u2019s another self-luminous artificial object [zooms in on the\nlarge dot same photo about the size of our moon that apparently\nmoves here there and everywhere wherever it will go obviously\nunder intelligent control but consider this thing consider the civilization the technology \nthe culture that can not only build something like that but put it\nin space move it here and there wherever they will for whatever\npurpose norman\nsays he thought they were making the rings which is why he titled\nhis book the ringmakers i\nsaid norman did you ever\nstop to think that they might be mining the rings we have concluded from several missions \u2013 voyager\none was only the first of\na whole bunch of them \u2013 that the rings are made up of minerals\nfrom perhaps god knows how many eons back when the planets were being\nformed and\ni said stop to think\nabout an advanced technology they could mine those rings and those\nminerals are gold mines you know talk about nutrients you have\ngot all that good stuff and\nhe says you know i\ndid not think about that that they might be mining them god i wish i knew what happened to norman i lost track of him but his\nbook is a monument to the fact that there are some decent men in nasa\nwho want the truth told now i want to ask for a show of hands how many of you are overwhelmed\nand shocked at these facts about those objects out there oh a few overwhelmed and shocked well that is good that is good i\nwas overwhelmed and shocked the first time i saw it and the first\ntime i began to put it together and considered what it meant because there we are getting to the important thing here what\ndoes this mean now i assume most of you are aware and familiar with a brilliant\neducator a physicist in new york by the name of michio\nkaku brilliant young man a\nquantum physicist theoretical physicist michio has come up with\nwhat he considers to be a possibility of four different kinds of\nadvanced civilizations type i ii iii and iv you by the way are members of the zero-zero type civilization not that you did not know that but you have not\nquite reached type i yet the\nconclusion many of us have reached is that we are looking at the\nresults of at least a type ii civilization referring to the photo\nagain]\n\n\nnow how do these guys out there look upon us really how do you think\nthey think of us i\nhave a pretty good idea because i have been getting some\nlegitimate information from american military and scientific people who have not only met some of them from out there but are working\nalongside of them in united states government national laboratories\nlike sandia los alamos brookhaven national laboratory in long\nisland which is one of the most super-secret laboratories anyhow we have scientists and military guys that have been working alongside\nof some of those dudes and they are in our midst when\ni retired we knew of four different groups they were all humanoid but they were all not the kind of guys who could walk up and down the\nstreet on a saturday afternoon without being seen or responded to but one of the groups of four looks exactly\nlike us in the sense that it could be sitting here in this auditorium\nnext to you and you would not know it next to you in an\nairplane or a restaurant or a theater they are\nin our midst guys this one group particularly is in our midst and apparently since 1954 when ike met them at muroc air force base\nin california they are been working with us trying to help us\nmake that transition from adolescence into adulthood and\nwhy are they doing that well apparently this is the same group\nthat had a hand in engineering our genetics 10,000 100,000 years\nago if\nyou want a little history on that subject read zecharia sitchin which i suspect most of you are familiar with his stories are\nshockingly accurate in that they literally tell the essential story\nof our beginnings they translate these ancient cuneiform tablets\nfrom sumer zecharia\u2019s\nnot the only one there was a brilliant englishman by the name of\nchristian\no\u2019brien who\nwent home a year or so ago christian o\u2019brien wrote a\nbeautiful unbelievable and powerful book called the\ngenius of the few if you\ncan ever find that somewhere get a copy christian\no\u2019brien said essentially the same thing zecharia has said we\nwere genetically engineered and they have been coming and going and they have been in our midst for a hell of a long time somebody\nsaid to sitchin one time zecharia when are they coming back and he said whatever made\nyou think they ever left and\ni do not think they did ever leave now again this is i think a little shocking information here at least\nit shocked the hell out of me now when i was in germany at a conference some years ago a russian\ncosmonaut by the name of marina\npopovich handed out a\nfew copies to me and to michael\nhesemann another\nresearcher friend of mine that the soviet phobos\nmission took on mars when it was out there 15 20 years ago the\nsoviets sent this fantastic mission to mars they named it phobos\n2 because phobos\n1 is one of the moons of\nmars twelve miles in diameter so they named their space mission\nphobos 2\nand they took a whole bunch of pictures one\nof the pictures they took which michael hesemann published in his\nmagazine is apparently a city the size of chicago under the surface\nin mars generating an enormous amount of heat because this\nphoto was taken in the infrared it is in german at the bottom here but michael had published it\nin his magazine from\nphobos 2\n\u2013 a city under the surface of mars the size of chicago you can\nsee practically the blocks the streets and so on so yes virginia there are martians and yes they are on mars and some of them are\nprobably here because we apparently do not look that different\nfrom each other but you will never see this published in an american newspaper or an\namerican magazine it had to be published in germany by michael\nhesemann next\nphoto] phobos 2\ntook another picture while it was in orbit around mars \u2013 and\nthe story i was told was that they literally planned to land on\nphobos the moon well they never got there because while they were\nin orbit around mars this thing came up from the surface of mars \u2013\ngigantic in size \u2013 and apparently bumped phobos\n2  to knock it out of\norbit and down it went so there is somebody up there who says no no no you can come and peek but then you cannot stay very\nlong and you are not going to take that many pictures we are\nnot going to allow it okay i think that does my photographs for you this afternoon now as i said to you i am ticked off i have this pissed-off\nroster which is a work of joy and pleasure for me as i\nsaid politicians at the top particularly the united states\ncongress they are a bunch of clowns they literally run a\ncircus back there theologians\nare right next below forgive me i am not\nanti-religious i simply do not like religion because it tends\nto divide people it separates people my\ngod is better than your god my book is better than your book my\nstory is truer than your story and so on and so on and so on so i am not religious at all i have studied them all i have\nstudied hinduism i have studied islam  i have studied\njudaism i\nwas raised a christian i have studied christianity i consider\nthe young man from galilee my best friend but that is another\nstory that i do not think we have time for me to get into i\nwent through a series of hypnotic past-life regressions a number of\nyears ago and one of the lives that i discovered was in galilee 2,000\nyears ago with him so i say he was\nmy best friend and he still is my best friend anyhow i am not anti-religious i respect the people who are sincere\nand honest about it but it does tend to separate people \u2013 it\ndivides people \u2013 and i try to promote the concept of a\nspiritual\napproach to life if\nyou human beings had the slightest idea of what you are my god you are incredible you are all of you masterpieces you\nreally need to know what yogananda said  you need to reach a state\nof self-realization when you recognize that within you burns a\nspark of pure divinity and it do not matter what church you go\nto or what language you speak or what politics you are or what\ncolor your skin might be  that do not matter you\nare divinity in itself you are part of that infinite spark which my\nfriend from galilee said the\nkingdom of heaven is within you the\ngang back there did not really grasp what he was talking about but his truths and his words are as legitimate today as they ever\nwere and you guys are getting there you are beginning to pay\nattention you are beginning to wake up now as i said my pissed off list goes down you know we had nasa the\npoliticians the theologians and then there is the american\nmass of people the public what is it they used to call it the\ngreat unwashed you know joe six-pack listen i have to be kind with joe because at the moment bless his heart he may have lost his job he may be losing his home he cannot\npay his bills he is got kids to send through school and educate\nand buy clothes for so i am trying to be gentle with joe\nsix-pack because he is carrying a heavy load right now there\nare tens of thousands of them out there all over the country there\nmay be some of them in the audience here tonight and you probably\nknow a few of them and they are damn-fine people so i am\nnot trying to fault them too much \u2013 the fact that they are\nnot paying attention i\nget a little ticked off \u2013 nascar basketball football tennis golf my god these fixations with these little balls you know freud would have a ball with that you know no\npun intended old sigmund would have a real fine time working that\nout okay forgive me for wandering it is important that i get some of\nthis stuff one\nof the things that i fault the average guy out there is for his\nattention span he seems to be suffering \u2013 the masses of them \u2013\nseem to be suffering what they call attention deficit disorder it is\na problem the kids in school have they cannot seem to focus on\nanything more than two or three minutes and then they are pfft\n off somewhere else pfft  off somewhere else i\nblame television for that as well as their parents for allowing them\nto do that how many of them sit down and read a book these days anyhow their attention span is very very limited the public at large has a\nlimited attention span for\nexample let me get back here go back a few years checking his\nnotes] ah wernher von braun said in 1959 \u2013 now get the year 59 five years after \u201954 now what the hell happened in \u201954 well something unusual happened\nat muroc air force base in california in \u201954 where an aging\npresident had an encounter that literally damn near killed him \nbecause right after this event in \u201954 at muroc the poor old\ndude had a heart attack he was not able to deal with this thing ed\nnote muroc afb has been renamed as edwards afb anyhow in 1959 a famous nazi by the name of wernher von braun who\nliterally built our saturn five program from the ground up had this\nto say and this appeared in several us newspapers \u2013 i kid you\nnot  this was published in newspapers wernher\nsaid in \u201959 we find\nourselves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hitherto\nassumed and whose base is at present unknown to us i cannot say more\nat present we are now engaged in entering into closer contact with\nthose powers now would not you have thought that wernher would have been mobbed explain this what the\nhell are you talking about who are these powers that you are\nreferring to i mean you are one of our top scientists you are\nbuilding the apollo program for us this\nis in \u201959 no major response like whhttt it just went\nover ah 1980 another german professor by the name of hermann\noberth\nsaid this and this\nwas quoted and published in several american newspapers we\ncannot take the credit for our record advancement in certain\nscientific fields alone we have been helped by the peoples of other\nworlds now did this cause a ripple did people say what\nthe hell are you talking about professor people of other\nworlds what it\ncries out for answers and there were not any and nobody made a\ndeal out of it and\nthen here we have something in 1987 \u2013 a prominent american\nsenator from hawaii daniel k inouye united states senator from\nhawaii he said this in a committee and it is in the\ncongressional record there\nexists a shadowy government with its own air force its own navy and\nits own fund-raising mechanism and the ability to pursue its own\nideas of the national interest free from all checks and balances and\nfree from the law itself and this is in the congressional record did\nthat cause a response did people mob the senator and say senator what the hell are you talking about this is dynamite attention\ndeficit disorder allen\nhynek said before he died a series of events occurred in new york\nalong the hudson river some years ago called the hudson\nriver events where\ngigantic triangular and boomerang-shaped objects a mile and a\nmile-and-a-half across hovered over the hudson river moved slowly\nup and down the taconic freeway there \u2013 hundreds of people\ngoing up and down guys pulling off the road looking up and seeing\nthis damn thing it\nwas gigantic it hovered over the indian point nuclear reactor for an\nhour all the alarms went off all of the security people responded\nto this thing \u2013 and it took place \u2013 and not one word from\nthe authorities about this except some stupid-ass idea of a\nbunch of guys were flying little planes around at night in formation the\nfaa to its eternal shame said things like that oh these guys were flying around in their little airplanes you know in\nformation at night \u2013\nnever mentioning that this was total violation of faa regulations as\nif those little guys in little airplanes could match something that is\na mile-and-a-half across \u2013 a boomerang a triangle attention\ndeficit disorder it goes on and on and on where\nam i here as i say i tend to wander forgive me okay i have given you your little parable i talked\nabout david froning i talked about ben rich i have quoted\ninouye von braun oberth the shadow government oh i want to touch upon one little other thing here there is an\namusing situation that has taken place i find it amusing and i find\nit tragic there is\na young brit by the name of gary mckinnon many of you are familiar\nwith this story gary it seems is a computer nerd he is a\nreal genius he is a hacker well gary happened to be able to hack into the defense department\ncomputers here about a year ago a little over a year now he hacked\ninto nasa\u2019s computers a little over a year ago and he come up\nwith some stuff that was dynamite so what happened is that we found about it and we got hold of the brits\nand we said we want that\nman we are going to put him on trial and we are going to stick\nhis ass in jail for 70 years and so help me god the british agreed to extradite young gary mckinnon\nto the united states for trial and sentencing now i stand curious\nto see what kind of a trial they plan to put on for mckinnon it is\ngot to be a public trial he is not a us citizen they are\ncharging him with a violation of our computer security systems and\nall the rest of it so this kid\u2019s being sent from the uk over to the united states and\nthey are going to put his little butt up in front of a judge and\na jury and charge him with damage by breaking into our nasa and our\ndefense department computers i\nand others have said they should hire the kid for christ sake and\nput him to work if he can hack into those computers he\nmust know what the hell he is doing ah but let me just touch lightly upon what did gary mckinnon come up\nwith ah what did he download when he hacked into those computers he\napparently downloaded some stuff packaged up the material and\nturned it over to a british researcher by the name of timothy\ngood now tim for\nmany of you who know of him he is probably one of the top\nresearchers on the planet he is a brilliant young man i say\nyoung \u2013 he is about the age of my son about 57 maybe\nclose to 60 anyhow timothy good apparently was the recipient of some of this\ndownloaded material from mckinnon mckinnon says i\ngot some dynamite here and he gave it to timothy good with the idea that maybe timothy\neventually could publish it now the question is are they going to\ntry to extradite timothy good to the united states and put his butt\nin front of a jury and a judge but\nwe do not know the brits i met in barcelona told me that this\nstory is pretty definite pretty true ah but what did mckinnon download ah let me just touch upon a couple\nof things \u2013 orders military orders transferring a commander\nfrom one vessel to another vessel now the vessels were named usss\ncurtis lemay and the\nother vessel that this guy transferred to this commander was the\nusss\nroscoe hillencotter now curtis lemay most of you are well aware dead now one of our top\nfour-star air force generals who bombed japan back to the stone age practically because he was strategic air command there is a vessel\nnamed the usss curtis\nlemay and a commander\ntransferred from that to the usss\nroscoe hillencotter now roscoe hillencotter is dead now but he was a four-star navy admiral\nwho was the first director of central intelligence now the guys the researchers have gone to the records and there are not no\nlisting of vessels with those names in the entire us navy manifest so the question arises my\ngod where is the curtis lemay where is the hillencotter the inference we are\ngetting is that apparently they are in orbit somewhere out\nthere and now we are talking about one of the biggest secrets\nof all time \u2013 where your missing trillions have probably been\ngoing there\nis a separate space program which you guys are paying for and\nthey are not telling you anything about it and as a result nasa is a bit of a joke we have a special space program and it is\napparently known as the united states aerospace command and it is a\njoint service agency that means it includes navy army air force marine corps and it also includes the british aerospace command they\nlaunch satellites from several different positions on the planet they maintain apparently an entire fleet of vessels in orbit they\nhave anti-gravity and zero-point energy which you guys have a right\nto and you are not going to see for another ten years now that is where your missing trillions have gone you know the\nstory 98 99 and 2000 1.7  a year\nfor three years disappeared off the books that bunch of clowns in\ncongress do you think there was an uproar do you think there was a\ndemand for answers where did that money go forget it now the day before 9/11 the secretary of defense says we are\nmissing three trillion dollars we cannot account for it it is\noff the books somehow we are working on it it may be an\naccounting error you know how they are doublespeak george orwell would be happy with\nthis crowd missing\nthree trillion after the already missing of $1.7  a year\nfor three years there is where the funding is coming for your\naerospace command that daniel inouye is talking about \u2013 a\nseparate shadow government that you have no idea exists and those\nguys have got the technology that ben rich says is 100 years beyond\nestablishment knowledge and really if you talk about being pissed-off that kind of information\ndrives me up the wall i say to you guys  and i hope you are\nas pissed-off about it as i am  we have damn well got to get\nsome answers from these idiots back there or our country is gone\nforever \u2013 and i do not want to see that happen when\ni went into the military i signed an oath to die for that\nconstitution if i had to and i believe in that constitution it was\na work of genius the best form of government that is ever been\ndevised they are trashing it and we are not standing up\nand defending it enough we are not insisting that they account\nfor being in office and drawing those big salaries okay guys i have covered a whole lot of stuff here as i said i tend to wander i guess it is the name of the game i am\ncoming to the end of my presentation here as\ni said i have been speaking out rather bluntly and loudly for a\nnumber of years on this subject as i said it is the biggest\nstory in human history because it is the story of human history it is\nyour story it is who you are how you got to be here and where\nyou are going and\ni told you that i am outraged at the doom-sayers oh god 2012 we are doomed it is all over the asteroids whatever a\npole shift we are all doomed that\nmayan shaman in germany years ago told me he said you\nwhite-skins you do it every time you screw it all up he said that is not\nwhat the hell the story is he\nsays i am an expert\non my calendar i am an expert on the history of my people and\nthat is not the end of the damn world \u2013 it is the\nbeginning of a new age he\nsays we look forward to\nit with anticipation and excitement the old world is coming to a\nclose and a new way of thinking is coming and it is going to be\nso unlike anything that is ever existed before he said we are so excited\nabout the future 2012\n\u2013 that day will come and go it will be the end of our long\ncount but so what what is important is there is a new age\ncoming and you guys are\nall a part of it and\ni say in closing that there are going to be some difficult times\nahead because we are literally in this transition that is a\ntransformative transformation not only of the planet but of the\nhuman species and it is primarily spiritual in its nature that\nis a very hopeful thing to discuss and understand and accept as\ni said we are phasing out of a phase of adolescence we are\ngoing through adolescence and we are going to reach adulthood if\nyou all remember i am sure you do adolescence was not a hell\nof a lot of fun i found it painful as hell when i was going through\nit and so did my mother and father while i was going through it but we are making that transition and it is hopeful and\nfavorable i\nwant to leave you with a remark or two that i think is important i am\na great fan of leo tolstoy one of my favorite authors he was a\nmystic a tremendous great writer philosopher count leo tolstoy\nsaid and i quote there\nis something in the human spirit that will survive and will prevail there is a tiny and brilliant light burning in the heart of man that\nwill not go out no matter how dark the world becomes and\ni want to leave you tonight with that comment about that spark of\ndivinity that burns brightly within each and every one of you god\nbless you and good night long\napplause hoots whistles ovation]\n\n\nthank\nyou i am finished ricardo\n             silva illuminati activities and high strangeness\n_____________________________ \n\u00a0during our january 2009 trip\n                      to quito ecuador we met an expatriate american who had\n                  had a number of very interesting experiences after a preliminary\n                  conversation we asked him if he would be willing to tell his\n                  story on record to project camelot for reasons that will become\n                  obvious to the reader he has asked to remain anonymous ricardo\n                  silva is a pseudonym.start of interviewkerry cassidy (kc the other caveat\n                  that i should tell you is that we do not know you i know\n                  bill  heard a little bit of your story.ricardo silva (rs right we are not guaranteeing at this point that\n                  we will publish it oh that is perfectly up to you if you feel\n                  it is right for what you are doing you know it\n                  still might be useful for you well absolutely and that is why we are\n                  here right i mean we are hoping it is publishable we are hoping there is something about it the reason i am giving you this information\n                  is because it helps you and your audience put bits and pieces\n                  together that they may be missing and we are recording\n                  now right?bill ryan (br we are recording all right so i want to give you folks this information\n                  because your audience out there may be where i was at before and they may have some doubts about some of these things being\n                  true some people may be looking for information because they want\n                  to help someone or they may even have gotten fortunately to the point they want to help themselves and they want to\n                  know what is truly going on and a lot of these things sound like total fantasy they sound\n                  like something out of a movie in fact it would make awesome\n                  movies and some people have made awesome movies\n                  out of some of this stuff and if it were not true then they would be\n                  even more fun to watch but my story starts with i want to focus on a relationship\n                  that i had an intimate relationship with a very very good\n                  friend that either way whether he has been murdered or\n                  he has been taken elsewhere against his will  either way this fellow is a victim of severe torture severe manipulation his body has been physically hurt with many drugs with many\n                  types of tortures and i am gonna describe how i became aware of this and\n                  how i got information you see folks like david icke to me came afterwards i did not read david icke first and then\n                  discover these things cisco wheeler came afterwards and i am\n                  going to be describing to you why and how i came about them and how i came up with their books and their information.so in this story i am not gonna use real names and i am\n                  not gonna use real places either can i ask you a question first of all yeah go ahead are you of spanish descent yes i am of spain yes i just wanted to check that because i can see that\n                  you have this in your vitality in my bloodline yes and bloodline because my father has some of this and i was just picking up on this energy all right so i just wanted to describe how this\n                  whole thing came about and what are the things that i have\n                  discovered which are quite unpleasant anyhow i want you to understand especially your audience that this information i am providing it so it can help\n                  others i met this fellow and i became really close friends with him and i started noticing awkward things about him here and there and one of those awkward things that brought us together is\n                  that he is a genius he is one of the most intelligent\n                  persons that i\u2018ve ever met in my i would say he is\n                  the most intelligent person i have ever met in my life this fellow can hold a conversation on just about any subject he holds it exceptionally well down to the point that i\n                  remember once i challenged him on a subject he was going on\n                  and on and on about anesthesiology and one of his practices one of his many practices was an anesthesiologist and i challenged him on the subject i says you know i think you are totally full of shit when you are\n                    telling me stuff you are just making it up on the fly how do you do it you know?he became very irritable and very furious and he turned around\n                  and went to his filing cabinet and pulled out a book and threw\n                  it in my face and when i grabbed it he says look who\n                  wrote it and i was like wow damn he actually\n                    wrote the book but it is an unpublished book  a whole bunch of\n                  unpublished books written by this fellow and books with very\n                  deep levels and technical areas this guy was approached and i saw his letters he received a letter once from the embassy in the country that\n                  he lived in a south american country and it was a letter\n                  from the us embassy offering him a job for $750,000 a year and it even gets into numerology because it is rather\n                  interesting the sickness of these people i do not remember\n                  the exact numbers so do not go do the numerology on this but it also came with an insurance policy with a number of\n                  $16 million something or another whatever the number was in case of his death and he went on describing what this lab would look like and\n                  this lab would be a place that you had go in and part\n                  of your contract and your agreement is that if something goes\n                  wrong in the lab if you happen to drop a vial or something they are not going to do anything to cure you there are\n                  armed guards all over the place they would shoot everyone and they would just burn the entire place down so you knew\n                  what kind of risk you were getting involved in but he was a pretty wise fellow and he knew this was a temptation because amazingly he was amazing in knowledge he also\n                  lived very very very poor he lived in a very small place slept on the floor had no wealth the things that came to him came to him temporarily like\n                  a constant nonstop flow of books but the minute he would\n                  read a book he would have to return it or get rid of it in\n                  some way so he never had too many books to show and not too\n                  much information to show there was a steady stream of people coming\n                  to him to teach him to train him and it was amazing i got\n                  to meet many of these people and it is just amazing the people within our society that support the system sometimes\n                  willingly sometimes unwillingly compromised at different\n                  levels but it was amazing how they would go to teach him and his skills in martial arts and medicine and several fields of engineering he was quite amazing an amazing surgeon though he was blind in one eye and i will get into the blindness of the eye because\n                  one of the ways to identify these folks is because their eyes\n                  will be slightly one eye will be slightly twisted and they will\n                  have a scar on one side of their face if i recall correctly it is the right side of the face they will have a\n                  scar and their eyes will be slightly twisted and what happens is and i will explain that as part\n                  of putting a chip in the back of their heads they end up losing\n                  the vision in one eye but the chip gives them certain super\n                  powers which are photographic memory being one of them and that is more advantageous to their handlers than the\n                  eye is so even having one eye there is amazing hand abilities i have seen this fellow do some just amazing surgeries\n                  that other surgeons could not even resemble the speed that\n                  he could do a surgery.and so let me tell you a little bit more of how i came about\n                  with this guy could i just interrupt here yeah ask me questions prompt me along just for the sake of some sort of introduction to\n                  this is there something that you could say about yourself\n                   without giving away anything that of course would identify\n                  you  but as context so that the reader will know how it\n                  was that you got to be in the position to become very close\n                  to a man like this yes what is your background this did not happen per my background it was\n                  just coincidental i think that we sort of vibrate at certain\n                  rates of knowledge in our society we are always gonna at some point or another we are going to attract similar\n                minds if you happen to be someone that has spent your entire life\n                  studying seeking knowledge information of any sort whatever\n                  it might be eventually you are just going to run into these\n                  people or you probably have them as your friends already they are probably part of your life already and you have\n                  no clue it happens to us so we understand this you know this guy took me years before i figured\n                  these things out you know i was intimate very close friends\n                  of his before i really started noticing that he was a program\n                  victim you know so the camouflage is superb it is\n                  awesome his family would know it but their family are all part of\n                  it and you start tracing details about these people  like\n                  every single male in his family has been assassinated his\n                  father his brothers you know all down the list it is\n                  assassination after assassination but when you look up these assassinations if you happen to\n                  ask someone and you happen to look them up in a newspaper or\n                  something there will be they are testings like his father was cut up in pieces with a machete you know and the common story that goes around is it was a jealousy\n                  thing well when you start learning more about these things you know there is no jealousy it is a message to\n                  others not to step out of line and that is what it really\n                  is.he had a sister that actually found out she was his sister\n                  after his death you know how sick that you can have family\n                  members you have been hiding and fortunately this woman\n                  was hidden but apparently there are several clones of this woman going\n                  around  and that is actually quite fascinating on its\n                  own there were events where she would walk in a room and there\n                  was some other person there and would start talking to her\n                  very intimately in another language that she could understand and he would have walked in and would look at this fellow and\n                  says no no stop stop it is not her period and\n                  he says whaddya mean it is not her so she can tell that she is been a clone because other\n                  people would treat her so emphatically and she would realize\n                  that she is been cloned i also think that this fellow\n                  has been cloned.well one of the things that i should say in this interview\n                  head-on what we are talking about is a victim of programming a fellow has a handler and he is one of the people that\n                  they would use to infiltrate government who was in a low-ranking\n                  government position but he could easily make it into a higher-ranking\n                  position in government he would be the person you would use for an assassination very similar to some of the assassinations of the presidents\n                  in the united states he would be the person you would use\n                  to infiltrate a medical institution or society or high-level\n                  medical government position he what happened to this man what happened to him well that is sort of\n                  the end of the story but i suppose we can cover that right\n                  now slaves are terminated at age 34 if they somehow do not\n                  serve another purpose at that age the memories start coming\n                  back and that most definitely was starting to happen to this\n                  guy he started researching on his own spiritual subjects and\n                  these spiritual subjects started opening up his mind and he\n                  started making other contacts one of them myself and having\n                  conversations about what you should be doing in life and what is\n                  good and what is wrong and what is moral and what is\n                  not moral obviously they do not operate they have multiple\n                  personalities so the personality that may be the one to go\n                  and commit an assassination is not the one you meet every day or the one you know every day these alternate personalities are rather difficult to see but occasionally you run into them especially if you are in\n                  close if you spend a lot of time with one of these people then\n                  at some point or another you are going to start seeing\n                  them if you happen to you know spend a weekend in their\n                  house then you might see a flare-up of one of these personalities if they are under severe stress for whatever reason then\n                  you might see one of these other personalities if you trigger\n                  it by bringing up a subject for example after i started finding out about these things i pushed one of the triggers and he very quickly reached into\n                  his pocket pulled out a very small .22 revolver  the kind\n                  of thing you would use for an assassination he pointed it\n                  at my head and he stopped and he said let us kill\n                  ourselves let us do it right now let us kill ourselves you pull your gun you shoot me i will shoot you i was like hey relax buddy you know that is\n                  when i realized that i had to be extremely careful\n                  about helping this guy being deprogrammed because you did not know what all the triggers\n                  were presumably is that it well it is just having this conversation\n                  that we are having right now about this point would have\n                  probably got us all killed ok so the trigger is bringing up the subject you\n                  know bringing up the subject of programming or anything that\n                  even remotely gets close to it they are programmed that if\n                  you really touch them and you really get close to who and\n                  what they are it is not only to kill you but commit\n                  suicide so they are out of the picture you know the\n                  programming failed and i experienced this myself you know having a gun put to my head was a nasty experience another mutual friend of ours he pulled a gun and he put\n                  a round next to his ear well it is a pretty damn clear\n                  message very very very clear message do not touch\n                  my programming do not play with it mm hm so here\u2019s a really interesting\n                  part which is when i first moved into this city i\n                  moved here because i was looking for peace and tranquility\n                  from many other problems in my personal life which are not\n                  related to this story but they may very well be in the same\n                  neighborhood of violence i have been at least a dozen times too damn close to\n                  a bullet and i was trying to run away from a situation where\n                  one of these times that bullet would be on me instead of being\n                  just too damn close so i decided to move into a remote part of south america and just retire and relax and have a peaceful quiet life and little did i know that i would run into so much of this\n                  in this peaceful tranquil place right so one of the things that happened was when i\n                  moved into the city i rented an apartment in the city and just out of curiosity  i happened to have a scanner i have\n                  been a ham radio operator since i was a child so i happened\n                  to have a fairly high-end sophisticated scanner one that\n                  goes from 100 kilohertz to 1 gigahertz  and just to see what is\n                  going on in the city you know see if there is taxi service ambulance hospital you know what especially in a small\n                  city i turn it on and something something was quite clear and\n                  quite obvious but i did not know the source it was a\n                  radiation and i do not remember the frequency but it\n                  was about 440 between 440 and 460 megahertz and it was full-blown\n                  radiation i mean full power also being an engineer in these areas and knowing communication\n                  quite well i knew that the radiation was not coming in\n                  on the radio and there is a very simple test you can\n                  do you just pull the antenna off of it and you can see if\n                  the radiation\u2019s being from the outside or is being generated\n                  by the radio itself ok what do you mean by radiation in this case transmission a radio transmission like a radio\n                  station a radio wave a transmission by radio wave you know like a static no it did not have any static it was like\n                  if you turn on your radio let us say an fm radio and\n                  they do not happen to be transmitting anything at that\n                  point you know there is no music or you turn on a tv\n                  channel and the screen is blank but it is on you can\n                  tell that you are there is a carrier wave you are\n                  connected to that channel ok there is something there but there is no signal\n                  on it scanners have a power indicator so they also indicate\n                  if it is a weak or a strong signal this happened to be\n                  a very very strong signal and then i became rather curious because it is an anomaly this is not supposed to happen you know no one in their right mind will turn on a radio and\n                  just leave it on for the hell of it you know plus it was\n                  covering a broad band of frequency so as a curiosity one day i happened to drive around the\n                  city and i happened to notice that this radiation goes on\n                  all over the city so i am pointing in the direction\n                  of the city where we are at and the city nearby\n                  where we are at yeah somehow it is not surprising so later on and i drove around\n                  on the outside of the city in different areas you know 15 20 miles and this radiation is not there the radiation is\n                  in the city and it covers a very large area of the city and\n                  is being done with multiple transmitters anyhow that stayed in the back of my mind as you know one\n                  of those little things that happen in life and you do not\n                  have any answers for it.later on one day my friend had i go to visit him and\n                  he had these air bubbles in the back of his neck and they\n                  were fairly large you know like between an inch and two inches all over the back of his neck he had some fairly large air\n                  bubbles and you could touch and you could feel it was air you know which is gas bubbles they would move around these\n                  gas bubbles and he says to me what the hell is this can you take\n                    a look at it what is going on and i says well it is obvious there is gas you\n                  know and that can only happen from a few things i happen to be a pretty proficient scuba diver so i know that is\n                  one of the ways that you can do that if you really do deep\n                  under water you stay too long and you go out way too fast you might get these gas bubbles come on the back of your head.the other reason is well you have been in a low-quality\n                  spaceship you know not in an airplane i am talking\n                  spaceship where the compression ratio would drop and increase\n                  dramatically because it was not designed properly so\n                  that is another possibility.the third possibility is being inside a pressure chamber which is a pretty damn awkward thing to be in one of them i mean there is very few people that have ever been in\n                  one and very few reasons to be in one of \u2019em and there is a fourth one i think a lung puncture would\n                  do that but you know those do not heal very easily you had end up in the hospital with some severe other problems.so no explanations four reasons there and none of these\n                  fit the paradigm i was so curious that i went on the internet\n                  and i started searching for air bubbles in the back of the\n                  neck oh my goodness what do i find cisco\n                  wheeler\u2019s\n                  book hm titled deeper insights into\n                    the illuminati formula by fritz springmeier and\n                    cisco wheeler]\u00a0 yes now pretty damn awkward book you would find for\n                  such an unlikely subject you know i was just hoping to find\n                  something in the medical records to talk about this so i went ahead and read this book about 400 500-page book and guess what the book talks about implants in the back of\n                  the head which are manipulated with a frequency at the 440 460 megahertz now is not that interesting you know?so i went back to my friend and i say hey can i take\n                    a look at the back of your head?and he says sure why not?and i say i just want to take a closer look.so i go and look and my goodness he has a surgery a little over half an inch in the back\n                of his neck now how do i know it is not just a scratch it is\n                  a surgery it did not have outside sutures if you hold\n                  the skin with your hand underneath you can feel if there is\n                  sutures underneath you know that it is not just a surface\n                  cut but there is also more to it underneath and yes there was a ball there of more underneath tissue that had\n                  been cut and sewed together but the outside scar  rather fascinating  had no suture stitches and was a very very thin line i mean very very very high precision i do not think we even have we\n                  do not have any instruments surgical instruments that\n                  i know anyhow that could do such a precision cut hm and an interesting thing about this guy he is\n                  an indian i am not talking about hindu you know i am\n                  talking about south american indian and you start piecing these things together i have also\n                  noted that he had severe scars all over his body he had scars\n                  on his arms scars many areas on his body had scars one\n                  that caught my attention was scars under his armpit he had\n                  some scars he told me that he had been circumcised as a ritual when he\n                  was i think he said 12 13 years old which is a rather unusual\n                  thing so i knew that this fellow would scar he is not the\n                  kind of person that gets a cut and does not leave a nice\n                  big ugly scar many indians in their genetics when they get\n                  a scar the scar will open up you can see it years later even scratches are noticeable years later.but here i went back a couple of weeks and i said to him hey let me take a look at the scar on the back of your neck well\n                    guess what not even with a magnifying glass you could find\n                    it it was gone i mean totally gone nothing left of that\n                    surgery and if i had not seen that surgery with my own eyes i would not even believe it if he would tell me that\n                    he had it.so i told him do you happen to know anything about these\n                    implants this was when things started getting rather\n                    interesting he went ahead and asked who i identified later\n                    on as his handler and he asked him about the scar he says what is\n                    going on what is this thing and he says oh we did it for your own good he\n                  says you see when we cut we cut that part of the brain when it heals it heals better and you will end up having\n                  more mental abilities perhaps some supernatural powers that\n                  you did not have before i said rather interesting so do not feel bad about it we do not do that\n                    to everyone we only do it to those who are ready for that.and what i noticed with this fellow is that in my assumption his programming was to be used up to a certain level and perhaps\n                  to be discarded when he was 34 years old but he started i guess maybe his handler had a love affair\n                  with him a brotherly love affair or somehow wanted to protect\n                  him or there was just a genuine that this guy is one of\n                  those few geniuses in the world so they started providing to him a huge enormous information but more on the conscious level not under drug-induced programming so he would get himself up to speed to the point that he would\n                  be good enough for them to manage companies and the goal was\n                  to give him a series of companies to manage and for him to\n                  accept what had been done to him and take it as a good thing and just keep on living.but at this stage things started getting really bad with\n                  him one of the things that happened that just tipped the whole\n                  thing overnight really bad he called me one day and at one point he started confessing and telling me things\n                  and opening up like for example one day he pulled up a briefcase and he had passports and id for every imaginable country that\n                  you can think of i mean he could go anywhere and be anyone from military ids from passports for multiple countries credit\n                  cards ids in different professions pilot license medical\n                  license he had one of the very few licenses in the world very few\n                  people have the license that the us government recognizes to\n                  transport any kind of drug anywhere this fellow could go anywhere be caught with any type of drug and he can just walk right\n                  by  which is something that is given to you know very top\n                  government officials with the excuse well we have\n                  got these drugs and we are transporting it from a to z you\n                  know we are police officers that kind of thing.he also had a license to experiment with drugs and it was\n                  recognized by the south american country where i live and\n                  it is recognized and is issued by the us government.and at first you know you look at these documents and you\n                  kind of like laugh about it you know you just do not\n                  take \u2019em too serious you know but later on as you\n                  start putting the pieces together you start realizing the\n                  seriousness of the matter.he had a flow of drugs coming into him all the time and the\n                  purpose they were given to him was to experiment and dispose\n                  of them so he did not keep a very i do not know i think he kept a stash somewhere of drugs and weapons but\n                  i never figured out i never got to see that so i assume\n                  there was somewhere that he had a stash of technology weapons drugs i only got to see some of it occasionally ok is this the same guy who you started to we are talking about one single person this is all the same guy yeah it is all one single person ok yep ok but what is the relationship such that you are\n                  involved with this person just purely friends that is it i just got\n                  close to him because we started having conversations on common\n                  subjects and just became friends you know nothing business nothing of any other nature just rs\u2019s colleague but would it be\n                  appropriate to say how you met him or is that going to reveal\n                  too much about his well how i met him is really not an important thing it was just a casual thing just a coincidence i had a patient\n                  that needed a surgery and a mutual friend just suggested that\n                  we go to him just a casual thing he being a surgeon so i\n                  just ran into him our mutual friend talked to him about me and said you\n                    know the two of you should meet you have got a lot\n                    in common and it looks like the two of you would become good\n                    friends and that is how we became we started\n                    a friendship just a pure casual thing i do not think\n                    it was meant to be it just happened.and these people are not meant to have friends they are\n                  not meant to have girlfriends or lovers or stable relationships\n                  or anything everything is provided for them in a very controlled unique environment they are kept extremely busy he is the if not the youngest one of the youngest mds ever graduating\n                  from this country which on its own is quite an amazing task.so anyhow getting back to when i discovered about this brain\n                  implant i started reading cisco wheeler\u2019s book and\n                  cisco wheeler started talking about how these implants work and how they leave a person blind from one eye well guess\n                  what my friend was blind from one eye.and it started talking about tortures and how coincidentally it would have been said that they had a car accident or motorcycle\n                  accident and you start piecing these things together and you\n                  start realizing at which stages do they get the heavy levels\n                  of programming.then i started knowing more about the family and i do not\n                  remember if it was his grandfather or his great-grandfather is one of the biggest drug lords ever in south america and you know that is fascinating because you do not\n                  trace it by his two last names but you get it through his\n                  mother\u2019s mother\u2019s last name you get the connection\n                  to the great-grandparents and who these people are then we start asking things about the family about the mother the mother that disappeared raised by other alleged family\n                  members you know all these pieces and you know father\u2019s murder his uncle\u2019s murder the other one\u2019s murder and you keep on going down the\n                  list of all these other people you start hearing in the course\n                  of knowing someone and becoming friends with him and you start\n                  reading cisco wheeler\u2019s book and you start connecting\n                  it one after the other and the other and you get 10 15 20 connections but why are you telling us this i am telling you this because i think there\n                  are people out there that may have family members that may\n                  have lovers that are under these circumstances and there\n                  are people like him that are waking up of this programming\n                  and want to get out of it and they may think that they are crazy that they are\n                  mad that there is something bad wrong with their brains that they are physically ill and in reality they are\n                  not there are people that may start waking up in the middle\n                  of the night and having memories of things that happened to\n                  them and they will think they are going crazy they are\n                  not they are not going crazy mm hm if you have one of these people as a lover or a\n                  family member these people need help they need help if\n                  they are programmed and start waking up things start getting\n                  really really really nasty down to the point that they will\n                  commit suicide or they will be killed.and i am saying this because there is a lot of people\n                  out there that could also be government officials listening\n                  to this that do not think that these stories are real that they think that these stories that they will read\n                  from cisco wheeler or david icke are fabricated they are not\n                  fabricated these things are real it is like ok well we are aware of this already you do not\n                  know maybe our videos but we interviewed duncan o\u2019finioan and he is a super-soldier who trained in this way that is what this fellow was perhaps not as\n                  expanded as this fellow and within his capabilities but a\n                  soldier a type of soldier that is capable of penetrating any\n                  area that speaks a whole bunch of different languages that\n                  speaks ancient languages sanskrit for example how\n                  many people in this world know how to read sanskrit fluently huh right it is pretty bizarre you know and is this person still alive ah here\u2019s the really interesting thing we\n                  can get to that part he got up one morning he went out and\n                  had breakfast and about 10 a.m in the morning he said he\n                  was a little bit sleepy he went to sleep he was found allegedly and i say allegedly found dead four hours later but his body\n                  was heavily decomposed ah god now bodies do not get heavily decomposed in\n                  four hours i mean four hours a body does not get\n                  heavily decomposed jesus yet his body was found there heavily\n                  decomposed so i have a big questioning allegedly he died\n                  from a heart attack i knew him quite well there was no heart\n                  attack this guy went out you know we have climbed mountains three thousand feet nonstop he had no problem with his heart and he was a fairly young guy when he died yeah 34 years old what a coincidence it is\n                  also the age that it is spoken of that these people are\n                  eliminated how long ago did he die about 2 3 years ago and i have always had\n                  the feeling that who was there dead and who was put away was one of his doubles and that this fellow is not dead i\n                  think he was too too too damn valuable i got to observe his next-door neighbor even though in a\n                  poor neighborhood this huge building erected in front of\n                  his house just to monitor him i mean from the top of his\n                  house i could see a part of the other building and i saw a\n                  huge amount of communication equipment and we are talking\n                  a third-world country there is no need for that kind\n                  of equipment and the people that were going in from different countries and in this particular case particularly from japan which\n                  has not made any sense to me but those people were there\n                  just to monitor this guy monitoring left and right all the\n                  time you know feed him a lot of the circumstances they live\n                  in a bubble and i was a problem in that bubble they are guided\n                  inside the bubble yeah ok but you know i have to say that this\n                  does not make sense unless we know more about you because\n                  i have to say that you have a role here that you are not\n                  revealing and that your background is very interesting well my background i probably have my own who were you working for you worked for somebody\n                  in the past did you work for the dea no i have never worked for any government institution\n                  at all i have worked for many large corporations many of\n                  the top 100 computer companies but i have never ever i have always made it a point to never do anything that\n                  can be used for a military application so i have never\n                  worked in anything military or for the government for that\n                  matter ok now bill had said they tried to recruit you\n                  at a young age yes that is happened throughout my life and\n                  i think it is a different story but we can talk about\n                  that throughout my life many scenarios have happened which\n                  put big question marks for me and i do not have the answers i stand out in many ways for example i had\n                  completed the equivalent of a master\u2019s degree in engineering\n                  by the time that i was 16 years old so it is an unusual\n                  thing for a 16-year-old to have that level of education even\n                  though i you know i have many accomplishments in my life so i know i stand out in sometimes i think i said to bill you know i feel like i have a mark somewhere you know an identifier\n                  or something that i attract these people as a magnet because\n                  many times throughout my life there have been these folks that\n                  have come into my life including one that is now now i\n                  can put a name on it they call it the economic hit\n                  man and i had the same scenario when i was 18 years old i had\n                  an invention and i put it out in a show and this fellow approached\n                  me and he started becoming friends and he started coming\n                  over to my house and after a few months he just sat me down one day and says you know i am an old man i have cancer i\n                  do not know how much longer i am gonna live and\n                  you see this little book that i have got this little telephone\n                  book and he says it is encrypted he says i\n                  can call anyone in the world and in fact what i want is you\n                  to inherit this phone book i want to give you this power this information and so he put me to a test name three\n                    people three top government officials anywhere in the world and we will be having lunch with them within 24 hours and\n                    i do not\n                    care who you name it could be the president of any country anyone you want i did not name any presidents but i did\n                  name and we did not take it to the three we only met\n                  with two of them but i mentioned two  governors and it was rather interesting he just picked up the phone called them up and he was rather rude and disrespectful to\n                  these people on the phone and just told them to meet with\n                  him immediately and the next thing i know we are walking in an airport and we are meeting with these fellows you know just\n                  having a little casual chat you know so he proved to me what\n                  his abilities were and what he could do.i played it wisely i took some advice that was given to me and being an 18-year-old you have a choice you can act very\n                  intelligent like i was or you could start acting pretty damn\n                  stupid so i started showing him my bad side you know alcohol and\n                  getting drunk and being irresponsible and never being on\n                  time or anything disrespectful and all the bad things an\n                  18-year-old could show so he lost interest in me and i do not know what would have been if i would have\n                  accepted or not but one thing that i knew i was not\n                  ready for that it most definitely was going way way way\n                  above my head at the time i do not think even right now\n                  any of us are ready for such power and corruption and everything\n                  that goes along with it.and throughout my life i have been for example i do not know if you guys ever heard abouttwo\n                  submarines that were found on the colombian border you never\n                  heard about those no there was two submarines found a\n                  few years ago i do not remember how many years ago 4 5 6 years ago they were found on the coast of colombia one\n                  had an estimated billion dollars in cocaine in it and the\n                  other submarine was empty well 20 years ago i was invited to design those submarines and again you know i know i stand out in my field but it is\n                  still quite a surprise that i was singled out and invited to\n                  be part of that team to design those submarines and i was shocked when i read in the newspaper that two of\n                  those submarines were found now you can only ask yourself what would happen to the engineers of those submarines the\n                  day those two submarines were found on that colombian beach you know was there something special about those submarines i mean they were not regular submarines right oh no no no were they small miniature i do not know i do not know the size\n                  these things ended up being but the idea was that you had\n                  take \u2019em to the coast of the states and you had\n                  take \u2019em on the bottom of a ship and any time you got\n                  any problem or something you had let go of \u2019em they could sit on the bottom of the ocean for a long time and later on they would just navigate themselves right into\n                  the back of a house through the canals you know like in florida there it is all full of canals and there is houses they have huge mansions and just quietly we will go over\n                  there and you had a role in designing them they were remotely controlled they were remote-controlled yeah remote-controlled ok fully automatic you had a role in designing them i was offered a role in designing these things but you did not accept it no i declined that one it was in the same shape it was informal i got invited to these parties and to meet\n                  these people well i was not a very pleasant person so they decided that i was not what they wanted and so throughout life i have had a whole bunch of these\n                  scenarios the strange experience you had with ibm is that\n                  what you were saying yes a very bizarre thing that happened to me i\n                  was working at ibm and it was a huge huge huge park in\n                  fact so huge there are a couple of bizarre things that happened i did not like the job and i did not give a damn\n                  about it and i could not care less if i would be fired and i was working as an outside consultant i did not\n                  like the job from day one i did not care anything about\n                  it so getting fired was not anything that had any value\n                  to me so when i got in and i started driving in\n                  the property i knew the police did not have jurisdiction inside\n                  of the property so i would drive my car every day just a little\n                  bit faster and i think there was a point there that i reached\n                  about 130 140 mph driving inside the park.so that kind of gives you the idea how big\n                  of a park we are\n                  talking it was just immense and i would swear every day that\n                  i would get out of the car you know security would come over\n                  and say you are fired out of here you know but it never happened and where was this in north carolina i think it is the research\n                  triangle in north carolina there was another one in south\n                  carolina so when i got in my office they had all the consultants\n                  go in through one security checkpoint at one end of all these\n                  buildings but my office happened to be in the other part and that was about a 20 25-minute walk going through all these\n                  buildings and one of the things that i always noticed ibm allegedly made there or used to make photocopy machines\n                   which is a big question why they got out of that business but they got out of a lot of businesses and it kind of leads\n                  you to see that ibm is just a cover-up for other operations so anyhow i used to walk through those buildings and i found\n                  them really empty but i noticed thousands and thousands of\n                  cars parked outside yet inside you did not see that many\n                  people and the lights were just ibm got into the thing that they\n                  told people that you know they were saving energy and they\n                  were going to dim the lights so anyhow you walk down these\n                  hallways and you barely had enough light to walk from point\n                  a to point b and you always knew there were cameras everywhere i mean ibm was known to even in the bathrooms watch out what you\n                  talk in the bathrooms there was plain-clothes security officers\n                  everywhere you know to go into certain labs you have to swipe your\n                  card there is two doors you have to sign a log you\n                  have to look in the cameras so security identifies you you\n                  know there is tons of security protocols even if you left your desk to go have a pee you had\n                  go through all that oh my goodness you had to turn off the\n                  computer which in itself is the worst thing you want to tell\n                  someone using a computer is to turn off the computer i mean it just takes forever to boot these things up you had turn\n                  it off you had to lock the power switch with a key you had\n                  to take everything you were working on all the documents you\n                  were working with put it inside of your drawer lock the drawer you had to sign a log you had to but that is the top secret part of ibm yeah but it is ridiculous because a lot of\n                  the stuff we were working on there i do not consider\n                  it top secret at all you know but anyhow those were their\n                  protocols.so anyhow you walk through this place and you find it kind\n                  of empty and i got there to the guy that i was reporting to and these are bizarre things i do not have explanations\n                  for them and he tells me you know we made a mistake and i highly\n                    apologize and i really beg you to please do not tell\n                    anyone but i do not need you i do not have any\n                    work for you so i tell you what you can go to your office you know we got you a really nice office you got your computer\n                    there you have access to anything and everything you want\n                    to there if you want any books is there anything that i can help\n                    you with let our secretary know but do not call asking\n                    me for work or for anything to do because i have nothing\n                    for you and i would very very very much appreciate if\n                    you stick around and do not make me look bad we are\n                    paying you real good you know take your time off do whatever\n                    you want you know so it was a pretty uncomfortable situation so i go to my office i turn on the these were the days\n                  of the mainframes you know and i connect to my you know to my terminal there and i find out that my terminal can go\n                  anywhere i can go into any government agency anything in\n                  the network before people even heard the word internet internet\n                  existed and it was a network primarily of ibm a university and government anything and everything military bases and\n                  i would just type names after names in there there were not too many directories it was not\n                  easy to search for things you had to assume a lot of things\n                  and you know create your own lists but i got into all sorts\n                  of different places some things were a little bit interesting\n                  here and there it was rather interesting to go through all\n                  these computers.anyhow i had my own side projects so one day i needed to\n                  use a microscope and the microscope we had in our lab was\n                  an inexpensive simple microscope and i could barely see something\n                  there and i knew it was there so i knew that with a better\n                  microscope i could see it and i figured i suppose someone\n                  around here must have a better microscope so i asked one of the guys that i allegedly\n                  and supposedly had to be working with i said hey mate where can i get another microscope he said why do not\n                  you ask that guy in the corner that you always say hi to in\n                  the morning and\n                  that by itself you know just kind of like  how does\n                  he know i say hi to that guy that by itself was rather interesting you know i go over to the guy he knows me quite well i do not\n                  know him but he knows me and i say can i get a microscope he\n                  says oh yeah sure no problem just come with me so we go to the elevator and there is a few people standing\n                  there in the elevator and he says no we will wait we will\n                  take the next one that is empty we take the next\n                  elevator that is empty and when the door closes he punches on the floor numbers he punches a sequence and that elevator instead of going up  which is all that\n                  i knew i thought we were on the first floor  that thing\n                  went down i could not tell how much but it went down\n                  several floors and when we went down it opened the door and a long long long hallway i mean that thing looked like\n                  something out of an x-file just like out of a crazy\n                  movie you know it was long huge it looked\n                  like an eternity and i am starting to sweat because i know that \n                  i am not supposed to be there and i do not have clearances\n                  for these things and i have no idea what is going on and i hear all sorts of animals animals by the tens of\n                  thousands in there and as we walk by you know i says to\n                  myself be cool i am gonna play this one cool so\n                  i look one of the doors was open and there is thousands of\n                  animals in cages in there i cannot say for what or not\n                  even what kind of animals because i was not about to\n                  stop there and look like this was something new to me you\n                  know i just kept on walking.and the rest of the doors were closed we got\n                  to one huge door  very very large doors i cannot remember\n                  exactly about five foot wide each door and about a good\n                  eleven twelve feet tall doors very large doors we open up and there is this huge room it looks like a football field in there he turns on the lights and there is\n                  about three four very very long tables well there were\n                  tables stacked one next to the other and i am talking\n                  long these things were i do not know at least probably\n                  200 300 feet long and they are filled with microscopes i mean this entire room was like going to the top world show\n                  on microscopes microscopes from everywhere in the world you\n                  name it they had one there if you could name a microscope i am willing to bet they had it including three electron\n                  microscopes in the back of the room and i was the only one\n                  there and he said which one you want to use and i am\n                  like which one is the easiest one to use here so i pick one that i could figure what to do with it.he says how long do you need it for i say half\n                    an hour and he says i will be back for you\n                    in half an hour so i stood there and i know that place had cameras all over so i just acted like i belonged there stuck my head on the\n                  microscope i used it ironically it did not work for\n                  the thing that i wanted to look at ah the things\n                  in life and i left there i went back to my office and i mind my\n                  own business i never asked any questions or anything.but all of these things pieced together understanding this\n                  fellow that i was telling you guys about and understanding\n                  that he truly was a victim of programming that he had been\n                  tortured tracing back through his family he probably had\n                  been tortured when he was inside his mother that his mother\n                  was deprived of raising him and that he was in an environment\n                  that was totally controlled and totally programmed and i hope he is alive somewhere and well perhaps he is perhaps he is not i do not know only maybe in\n                  the future i will run into him someday but i have\n                  got a feeling this fellow is not dead so have you been threatened have i been threatened no none whatsoever yet at the same time are you protected by some people i do not know maybe i am maybe i am\n                  not maybe at the spiritual level i am being protected there is been like a lot i have mentioned i have\n                  been too damn close too many times to a bullet and when i was two three years old there was an attempt of kidnapping\n                  me and it is a whole scenario that is quite bizarre i come from a very very poor family so there is really\n                  no reason to kidnap a poor child you know nonetheless that day i was protected the entire neighborhood\n                  got filled with police of every sort and i remember that experience\n                  quite vividly i guess maybe when we are really close\n                  to death for real you know even if we are two three years\n                  old somehow these things get memorized in our minds vividly you were actually born in south america no i was not born in south america and then 5 6 7 years old there is a little crack in the window\n                  on the car and my dad went to fix the window a few days later and he finds a bullet you know a bullet that could have been\n                  in my head rather easily.i am sitting in my house years later and i get up go\n                  to have a drink for whatever reason i got thirsty i went\n                  to the kitchen i come back sit back on my sofa and i notice\n                  that the window\u2019s open there is air coming in so i go inspect what is going on and there is a\n                  bullet right behind me in the seat of the chair another time i found two bullets in my front door a bizarre thing i found a couple once trying to break in i am watching tv i am sitting there watching tv and they are breaking in my door it is just a bizarre\n                  thing you know like what do you want and they\n                  keep on going at it you know until i went out i have always been a gun enthusiast so i pull out a shotgun and when they heard that then that got the message i mean they were not going to walk out alive if they walked in.i am sitting in a hotel two guys break in the door it just happens to be that i have always enjoyed guns so i happen to be cleaning a couple guns and i just aim it\n                  at the door they just break in the door of the hotel and\n                  they say sorry and they just left so damn fast it is a miracle that no one died that day.you know these things have happened you know i am\n                  on the street just minding my own business got out of my home\n                  in the morning and i am looking through the side mirror and i am looking two cars back and there is a guy\n                  holding a gun with both hands and looking at me he is\n                  holding it on the side he was a passenger and i could tell\n                  he had a gun in his hand and he had his eyes fixed on me.and all these things happened so many times that i just became\n                  totally uncomfortable about living in the states.rs\u2019s colleague tell them about washington dc that is a crazy bizarre thing you know i am\n                  on l street i do not remember l and i forgot it\n                  was so many years ago l and 17 or whatever and i was pretty\n                  young back then i was between 16 and 18 and i have a friend and my friend says to me he had read all about the bus system and he was for whatever bizarre reason he was excited about\n                  the bus system in new york.it is never excited me you know bus systems kerry\n                  laughs] i had prefer going in a limousine or something\n                  else but he wanted to take the bus and he insisted and insisted\n                  that he had the routes and he wanted to take that bus and\n                  the guy was from argentina so anyhow we were tourists there i said what the hell we will take the bus you know it was 11 the bus was supposed to go by at 11 p.m we waited there till midnight and you know we are sitting\n                  there and i see this taxi comes by the taxi looks like he\n                  may want a fare but the bizarre thing is the taxi is looking\n                  in the opposite direction of where we are sitting we are\n                  sitting on the sidewalk and he is looking in the opposite\n                  direction he goes really slow and the same taxi goes around the neighborhood and he does the same thing this time he drives much slower but he is looking in the opposite direction it seems\n                  if he wanted to get a ride he had be looking at us you\n                  know anyhow about three four taxis went by and the same thing  they are\n                  looking in the opposite direction in the street then comes a sports car that something did not fit because there is two guys in it and the guys were about\n                  40 years old they do not fit with this super-charged huge tire it was something like a camaro or something like\n                  that you know it just did not fit but again these guys drive very slow which someone in a\n                  sports car like that does not make much sense either they drive very very slow and they are also looking\n                  at the opposite side of the street so my friend and i we are now looking at the opposite\n                  side of the street and we are like what can possibly\n                  be so interesting about the wall on the other side and we are looking and looking and looking and as we are\n                  looking over there just curious what must be on the other\n                  side  there is a bust or something we are not seeing you know the bus shows up my friend goes in the bus and he goes and sits down and as i am coming in i have never been in a bus in\n                  my life not much buses you know i am trying to figure\n                  out how much you know how to pay a dollar or 25 cents or whatever it was and here\u2019s this black fellow black african fellow driver and i swear if a black man can turn white that man\n                  turned white you know well i do not mean really white but i mean white-scared and he starts shaking all over and he says p-p-p-please do not move fast do not do anything stupid do not do not do not move fast do not do anything\n                    stupid slow slow slow do not do anything stupid i am like what the hell is it with this bus driver you know he is like begging me and he is\n                  trembling and he is shaking and he is about to go\n                  totally out of control begging me to not do not\n                  move fast easy take it easy no trouble here please be easy and then he finally says something intelligent he says very\n                    slowly very slowly take a look out the window take a look\n                    out the window very very very slowly do not move\n                    fast do not move fast very slowly it was something like right out of a movie right i do not know what is going on i am cool you\n                  know i am totally relaxed so the advice seemed wise for whatever unknown reason so i bend my knees very slowly and i look out the window and i go holy shit there are guys that had gotten on top of the bus i mean these people were trying to do this quite well they had jumped\n                  on top of the bus and they were aiming at me with guns and\n                  the bizarre thing is a couple of them had a laser but these\n                  lasers were green and apparently green lasers were the first\n                  ones to be developed for that kind of thing and they are aiming at me from everywhere the building\n                  across the street  they busted the windows and there were\n                  guys aiming rifles and the taxis  they shut off all the\n                  taxis they were on top of the taxis and the sports car and\n                  they are aiming with rifles at me from every location\n                   from the back from the front from everywhere and this\n                  guy was giving me some good advice here so these two guys come in the front door and they were the\n                  ones from the sports car the two guys that were about 40 30-some 40 years old and you know the only intelligent\n                  thing that came out of my mouth was like can i see some\n                  id you know one of them you know he had a big chest he just puffs up\n                  his chest and well you could see that he was carrying a\n                  huge piece and at that moment it looked like the biggest gun\n                  in the world i mean it looked like something out of a clint\n                  eastwood movie it might have just been a little .38 but it\n                  looked huge to me hm and he reached very slowly to his other pocket on the other\n                  side of the gun and he pulled out some id and he showed it and i do not remember exactly i remember one said\n                  secret police and the other fellow i am pretty sure\n                  he said cia but it could have been fbi or something else.i says what do you want and he said step out\n                    of the bus very slow and that is what i did i\n                    stepped out of the bus very very slow and the minute that i set foot on the sidewalk my friend\n                  comes out  really loyal friend i must say  and he said i am\n                  with him and they almost shove him back in the bus and\n                  it is i am with him so they finally let\n                  him come out and they told the bus driver to leave he leaves and then all of a sudden one of these fellows makes a hand\n                  signal and they all start leaving everyone starts leaving all the guns start going away everyone starts jumping in their\n                  taxis everyone starts disappearing like nothing has ever happened\n                  here and both of them turned their back on me and they started\n                  walking towards their car so i went and tapped one on the shoulder and i said excuse\n                    me fellow you just almost made swiss cheese out of me back\n                    there not to mention you might have gotten a few yourself you know what the hell is this all about do not you\n                    think you owe me an explanation i mean you almost killed\n                    me i mean almost so what is going on and he looks at the other one they look at one another and\n                  then he says well i guess and i says yes you owe me an explanation and he says well you see there is this guy that\n                    we got you confused for and this is bizarre i am\n                    quoting word for word of what each guy said which makes\n                    no sense to me he said there is a guy that had killed four politicians\n                  previously in the last weeks or whatever i do not remember\n                  how much he said but he said that tonight he was going to\n                  kill five of them by midnight and you just happen to look\n                  like him and i go mm hm and i go is there anything\n                    else you have to say?he says you from here and i says no i am not and he says well i suggest that you take a very early\n                    first flight out of here if you have no business around\n                    here take the next flight out of here because we made a\n                    mistake but maybe the next people might make a worse mistake so i suggest you just get the hell out of washington dc bizarre crazy thing like god you know how can me here you know 16 18 years old be confused by some guy that is\n                  gonna kill five politicians not one not two not three but\n                  five which is a kind of weird thing the number five you know so all of these crazy things have happened throughout my\n                  life that i would assume that they connect somehow but i do not understand if they have the guns\n                  on you and all this kind of thing did they ask you for id nope how did they know that you were the wrong guy well i guess when they saw me face to face i\n                  mean come on i am a 16 18-year-old i mean i do not\n                  know yeah but you do not have that many people\n                  rounded up to pull guns unless you are absolutely positive\n                  who you are right you would assume so right it takes a lot of time to do an operation like that so they must have known what you looked like how many years\n                  ago was this oh quite a few years quite a few years right really bizarre\n                  thing you know that scenario went through my head for many\n                  years and one of the things that i thought it was well maybe\n                  it was like a trainee exercise you know they just pick anyone\n                  and you know just play out a trainee exercise on anyone screw it it is washington dc they are trying to\n                  protect the president etcetera so just do it you know?so all my life in many times i have had a tour of many\n                  of these little secret things things that no one is supposed\n                  to know and i do not know why but when i start putting\n                  them all together you can obviously see they are not\n                  coincidence there is something to it you know yes well what were you doing i do not understand they give you a job at ibm you sit there in an office you\n                  can do whatever you want and you have access to whatever you\n                  want and i do not know you made your own job at that point no no no i did nothing why\u2019d you need a microscope that was one of my own side jobs like what i did work for other companies making extra money you know it had nothing to do with them but these bizarre\n                  things happened to me time and time after time in my life you know i have been paid somewhere between 8 and 10 years\n                  of my life in my career for doing nothing i literally mean i am talking doing absolutely nothing i have just gotten\n                  a paycheck for doing nothing what did you do when you did nothing though study because i have some similar experience in which\n                  i would go studying i would spend my entire life studying i would go to a job and there was nothing to do so i would surf the net and i assumed they were watching they wanted to know what i was looking for that is a possibility they were observing me that is a very good possibility so you must have done like you said you looked\n                  around you did this you did that it never occurred to me that i would be a guinea\n                  pig that they were just observing and that is a very good\n                  possibility.rs\u2019s colleague tell us about the security of\n                  your access yeah i will tell you about that in a second but you know right this moment i am piecing some things\n                  together it has never crossed my mind that i may be the one\n                  being observed it has never ever ever crossed my mind and you mentioned something the other day about someone here\n                  proposing a government coup and you know they come and tell\n                  me and i said why in hell are you telling me i got nothing you\n                  know i do not give a damn if you do or if you do not you\n                  know and you propose that maybe it is just to see what is\n                  my reaction to it and now that you say this see i had\n                  this job i get this job and for five years i do absolutely\n                  nothing i get a paycheck in the mail i never worked i never ever ever ever worked i just got the paycheck in the mail and it gave me the opportunity to study and study and study and just keep on doing my own thing you know i did the same thing you have had the same scenario amazing yes i did that at jpl amazing that someone will pay you a salary it happened to me all the time it happened to you all the time yeah yeah but you were kind of there on-call to do admin work but you did not have a lot to do supposedly but i had nothing to do nothing and i always used to think to myself why am\n                    i here they do not need me you know why\n                    did they have me come to work you know you know like at ibm what i first did is i had\n                  cruise all the databases of knowledge about computers to improve\n                  myself and i would at least i felt that my moral at least i am\n                  getting paid my ass will learn something at least about their\n                  own things you know later i brought in a library of books i would buy books after books  about books and computer\n                  tie-ins most of them and i would study those books because\n                  i felt you know at least they are paying me for this you know i might as well but this kept on and on and on you know?a scenario that i had in another ibm building and this\n                  was i do not know whatever became it would be interesting\n                  to know what became of that building it was in florida this\n                  huge building immense very impressive building these buildings\n                  are really ultra-safe these things could go through a pretty\n                  heavy earthquake etcetera and one guy walks in to me and he is a neighbor now i party with this guy we are you know the kind of\n                  people we will get together for christmas and new year\u2019s\n                  eve and dinner you know he is your average joe i mean there is nothing interesting about this fellow you know or even about myself but one day he walks over to my office he says hey come with me there are things  things you know plural  that you need to see and you need to know.i says ok and he says let us take a walk and i says man we are gonna get fired out of here\n                    in a heartbeat you know these people are probably\n                    gonna press charges i am never gonna hear the end of\n                    this shit and he keeps on telling me relax nothing\u2019s gonna\n                    happen and then he says i know that nothing\u2019s\n                    gonna happen is this one of these situations where you would\n                  have had to close down and sign out and lock up and he is\n                  saying do not worry about it no no he is saying there is no worry\n                  about we cruising around ibm ok i mean ibm it is a secure place who knows\n                  what they are working on there you are not supposed\n                  to be walking around i mean specifically they give you a\n                  nice little long speech when you start working there about\n                  the security issues i have seen people there fired within a couple hours you know i saw a guy get three pink slips in two three hours boom fired you know they just started work and they have not\n                  even been there it was not even oh we will\n                  give you a break because this is the first day no you are\n                  out of here you broke security three times you went to take\n                  a leak you did not lock the door you did not lock\n                  the computer you are out of here in one day you\n                  know and it is three pink slips in your life there it is\n                  not even you know they will reset it every three months\n                  or a year or whatever no no it is three that is it you can be there 10 years you get the third\n                  one you are out you know?so anyhow we start and i did not give a damn about\n                  the job either because i was not doing anything i was\n                  just totally bored you know and just enough is enough you know so we start walking down the hallways and it is let us\n                    check out this lab and he said your badge will\n                    open the door and i said you know these damn things are programmed\n                    only for the places we can go and he says no your badge can go anywhere in ibm in\n                    fact your badge can go anywhere in ibm in the entire world and i says yeah right so just to prove him wrong i stick in the badge beep door opens i says i betcha\n                  the next one is not beep i look at the camera and i\n                  says now security is on its way you know walk around the lab take a look you know nothing get out well let us go to the next one you know and he comes with me and so we went from labs to\n                  labs doors to doors every security thing the only thing that i found interesting was there is\n                  an enormous  and this no one was supposed to know about it\n                   was an enormous amount of hindus working at ibm secretly\n                  working there there is no one the americans did not\n                  know about it and chinese people huge number of them by\n                  the hundreds not hundreds  thousands were there you would walk down hallways after hallways all hindu\u2019s\n                  names and there was like the hindu section there was another\n                  section that were chinese and they were there with their names\n                  on the doors and everything just walk by and say hi to a few\n                  of them stuck my badge everywhere i went from building to building\n                  to building i said that is it man this is not\n                  even going to be fired they are just going to execute\n                  us here and then i kept on working there for\n                  months you know collecting a paycheck just paychecks rolling\n                  in you know ok but there is something i wanted to say about the\n                  chinese we do wonder and this is another little conspiracy\n                  piece here that i had like to add for your audience we\n                  do wonder this whole thing we recently heard and it is\n                  all over the internet about the chinese being able to control\n                  air force one and the chinese placing rs\u2019s colleague back doors in the chips yes back doors in the chips and six nuclear cruise missiles\n                  and a b-52 and all that even to me the question was well how the chinese could ever get their hands in there you know and then i remembered when i was talking to you i remembered i said oh damn i remembered that whole aisle of\n                  chinese working at ibm by the thousands you know?there is another little interesting scenario you can\n                  verify this very easily on the internet there is approximately\n                  2 million engineers unemployed  usa-born engineers top notch unemployed at the same time if you look at the government\n                  statistics there is how many i had say close to 2 million over a million but i do not know the number but if you look at the us\n                  immigration statistics you are going to find almost exactly\n                  the same number of foreigners  indians chinese russians\n                   working in the states now do you wonder anymore how these things got developed first you wonder if there is any truth to the story but\n                  then when you hear other pieces you start saying yeah there is truth to the story another interesting thing that happened i was working near\n                  the fort lauderdale airport and there is a cafeteria\n                  there you know for pilots to go in and have a snack and\n                  actually have some good sandwiches and have a coke or whatever and we used to go there often and there is a guy there sitting at the table that he\n                  wants to show me because he worked with me in some other projects by the way always as i mentioned i have never worked\n                  in anything military and he says i want to show you\n                  how the planes are coming in and out remote-controlled so\n                  i must have seen in that airport a hundred planes go in and out full remote control now how do you tell they are remote-controlled they\n                  have a jerky movement they might jerk to the left and they\n                  jerk up and down but it is a distinguishable jerk and\n                  the jerk is because the servos the technology in some cases\n                  had not developed to do more smooth the software and everything\n                  takes time so they auto-correct themselves too quick and\n                  the plane shows a jerk mm hm and also a lot of these planes they did not\n                  have any windows in it or there are some that have very dark\n                  windows so you can tell that plus you see the plane park\n                  and sit there for an hour and no one comes out of it you know yes so there is some obvious things about these\n                  planes being remote-controlled.then we look at the twin towers and wonder whether they were\n                  remote-controlled or not so you know you got the answer\n                  there about those remote-controlled planes.so i do not know throughout my life i have been bits and pieces here and there are shown to me and it is\n                  like for some reason i have been guided to see these things maybe it is for today to say all this here i do not\n                  know did not you say also that you had seen on\n                  some of the 9/11 videos  the public sector videos the media\n                  videos  you saw some signs that some of those planes were\n                  remote-controlled i was sitting in a restaurant here in south america people they do not i guess because a lot of people\n                  do not have tvs at home or whatever or they are\n                  totally hypnotized by the tv but every restaurant has a tv and they are always playing the tv it is always\n                  on in fact you have to beg \u2019em to turn it off and it was a restaurant it was full it was mid-day there\n                  was a lot of noise in there and i just happened to look up\n                  at the screen and you know i see the twin towers and i\n                  see this plane and i see the jerky movement you know and\n                  then it hits the tower i think it is a movie so i tell my friend that i am\n                  sitting there with i says gosh you know what a crappy\n                  movie i mean could not they even re-do it again you\n                  know move the strings a little bit slower or something i\n                  mean just re-shoot it again or something and make a better\n                  movie what a crappy movie and as i am saying that there is people congregating\n                  around the tv and they start raising the volume and that is\n                  when i realized that this was not a movie that this was\n                  a live shot and then i remember the little jerky movements\n                  of the planes and i said ah and i said it right there to him you know within minutes i said oh my goodness that is for real and it was done\n                  with a remote-controlled plane and i said i know\n                  where they designed those planes fort lauderdale florida i saw it with my own eyes that is where they designed\n                  the damn planes  and so confident to fly a remote-controlled\n                  plane inside a city when i saw the 9/11 you noticed that well no no i do not know anything about\n                  that kind of stuff but i thought it was a movie oh you thought it was a movie yes we have been told by somebody one of our whistleblowers henry deacon worked on the remote control apparatus for those\n                  planes so he said they were remote-controlled planes yeah well there is so many people another\n                  place that i worked another guy came over one day and he had\n                  the itch to tell me i do not know why people have this\n                  itch to tell me things you know because this guy the best\n                  way to describe it he had an itch to tell me he did not\n                  know me very long but he just had to tell me and he had to tell me he worked on the what is it called haarp that he had worked on and that is the first\n                  time i ever heard of that and it was a top secret project and i will tell you what he said he was not totally i am not sure if he was totally sure he knew what it was\n                  for but he said that haarp was able to track any vehicle anywhere\n                  in the world that it had no limit of tracking ability it\n                  could track any vehicle anywhere and that was what it was for and it was an ultra ultra ultra high secret project and\n                  we are sitting there on the internet and i says what\n                  did you just say this thing was and i type it out and this guy nearly fainted when he saw that there was something\n                  on the internet about it and then he went on reading it all you know and he came back for several days you know that\n                  is a lie that is not true that is not it you\n                  know i worked on that thing but he was\n                  even surprised at the name that it popped up on the internet that is cool why he called me and had to tell me i do not\n                  know what about your parents are they alive excuse me here i have to leave.rs\u2019s colleague i have got about five more\n                  things that we might talk about but just one little thing here i just want to say this sounds like the truman show you were\n                  talking about movies earlier on well i have got a few things that i want to\n                  share with you i overheard you say you were going to meet\n                  with david icke right yes and i want to tell you how i came across meeting\n                  david icke and if you want to hear just for a minute i was\n                  coming back from an astral trip i am laying like you are coming back from a  what \n                  trip an astral trip i assumed you already know what\n                  an astral trip is yeah but most people do not say it casually\n                  like that that is interesting ok the plot thickens well i assumed you know what it is yes so i do not have to introduce the astral right so i am coming back and let us see i am\n                  coming like this side at this angle into my body like this\n                  over here and as i am over here guess what i cross a lizard and oh my goodness if you want something to really scare\n                  you i mean you look one of those things in the eye it is\n                  enough i did not sleep for about a week and i just happened to cross right in front of him i suppose\n                  it was a \u201chim and it was about gosh six and a half or seven feet tall probably 250 pounds more muscles\n                  than you can like muscle from everywhere but it is\n                  a lizard it is like when you watch the star trek shows\n                  and you see one of these lizard creatures this one did not\n                  look like anything in star trek but it would nonetheless\n                  fit that description and i did not even know what to\n                  call it i am using the word \u201clizard now and as i come into my body i am looking at it and it\n                  is looking at me and i get inside my body and i open up my\n                  physical eyes and i stand up in my bed and it is here\n                  in 3d in this reality it is in front of me in my bedroom face to face for about a second i swear my heart stopped because that thing just by looking\n                  at you i think it is like probably enough to kill you just the look is so intimidating and then it shifted i suppose it shifted back to the dimension\n                  that it was traveling on and it disappeared i swear i did not\n                  sleep for weeks after i saw that.but then i went on the internet and i says you know maybe i am not the only one that is seen these\n                    things you know and i started looking for snakes and obviously the word is kind of obvious so i pretty quick\n                    ran into the word \u201clizard and it did not\n                    take very long that i connected to david icke\u2019s website so that is how i found out about david icke and what\n                  i have read all the things about david icke connects\n                  more pieces of this fellow and what are programming victims\n                  for and the whole long list of things that we have heard\n                  of ok well i have seen one too and i was partly\n                  in a meditation or something and i did not believe in\n                  them i did not believe they exist well after that you do it went right by me i was completely amazed and it had wings it had wings and it was gigantic if this thing had wings i was past the point of\n                  noticing that i was not about it was there and it wanted me\n                  to see it that is all i know it wanted you to see it you see they are not all bad apparently there\n                  are some with these others good i did not feel that this thing was bad but you would not want to mess with it on\n                  the other hand i mean a creature that can travel between dimensions you\n                  do not want to deal with yes that is true if you guys continue this\n                  conversation i am gonna listen to it immediately at\n                  the first possible moment thank you it is been a lot\n                  of fun i have no answers either but this is great stuff just pieces of the puzzle a great thing to share with our audience and others\n                  might have pieces this is one of the important things  others\n                  might have pieces you know another thing that after i learned more\n                  about this and i started realizing what a program victim is i now have identified about a dozen and it is very despicable\n                  what happens and like i said i have a magnet for it somehow i attract\n                  it and one of the ones that i attracted was an extremely a very very very young woman that i ended up having a sexual\n                  affair with for a long time for several years and this woman was heavily programmed i mean very heavily\n                  programmed but this is a low-level programming she is\n                  programmed as a sexual pet and somehow i trigger her sexual\n                  programming and there is basically no saying no to\n                  a woman like that a woman like that is on a scale of 1\n                  to 100 she is 1000 in bed i mean she is just beyond\n                  the porno star beyond anything and it is just her\n                  sexual abilities are just overwhelming ok so at the same time it is interesting that this\n                  person does not enjoy sex and there was one thing and again these books talk about it this woman spends most of\n                  the time always pregnant not from me i always took caution\n                  that that did not happen from me and she was always\n                  having miscarriages and her even though she was very pleasant\n                  otherwise her vagina was extremely stretched and it was obvious\n                  that that is how she had been tortured how she had\n                  been programmed and it is amazing to see these people come in and out of different\n                  personalities  in a fraction of a second you\n                  could sometimes see it happening in a minute\u2019s time you could see three personalities come in and out but how did you know when did you know that she\n                  was programmed programmed when i started seeing her behavior you know one day she will come in my goodness the woman\n                  wanted to rape me in the middle of the city you know it was\n                  9 a.m monday morning and she wants to have sex in the car\n                  parked right in the middle of the street you know it is not a normal behavior it is something\n                  that is done for some un-normal reason it may be fun it may\n                  be a challenge it may be interesting but nonetheless it is\n                  done for some totally un-normal behavior because no one in\n                  the right of their mind is gonna do such things you know and it is she is programmed to approach people to get the video to get the picture to do this to someone that they can compromise you know mm hm someone you want to get rid of someone that is\n                  married someone that is a politician you unleash a woman\n                  like that and it is nearly impossible to say no to\n                  a woman like that.rs\u2019s colleague and the next day did she remember\n                  it oh yeah the next day she asks me she\n                  says you know i got something to ask you and i hope you\n                  do not get offended by it did we have sex have we ever\n                  had sex together and i was like nah sweetie no your imagination you\n                  know so you could tell these people are horrendous victims you know they can actually perform all these sexual acts and\n                  the next day they did not even have a clue about it and\n                  would actually honestly be asking whether they had or had\n                  not done something ok and you are saying you had a relationship\n                  with this person for several years yes i came across her and again i do not\n                  think it was pointed at me i am not the type of person that\n                  is in politics who could care less about any compromising\n                  photo i do not give a damn first of all i do not\n                  think anyone cares to put my picture in the news and if they\n                  do i really could not care less you know whether they\n                  use it today or they use it 20 years from now i still could not\n                  care less you know because i am very open-minded about\n                  sexual issues so i am not the person that you can get\n                  in a compromising situation so i just i just rolled with it i had fun with it and after\n                  a point i felt very bad for her and i tried to help her and\n                  there was no deprogramming this woman i think she is\n                  way past the point of deprogramming really it is a shame it is a real shame that someone\n                  is taken beaten raped abused tortured you know all these\n                  things and she started talking about some of these scenarios she started talking about a situation where she had been gang-raped had been tortured but she had no physical scars visible physical\n                  scars of these tortures.and then i have run into in our local town you do not\n                  have to go very far you can go check it out yourself i do not\n                  want to talk about it there are people here that\n                  you can go see it for yourself it is quite a shame you know you can see the scar on the face the blindness\n                  in one eye they hold government positions it is a shame it is really because when you see one of these people then you know how those scars come from you know why how\n                  did they get it you know ok so how did you end up down here i came down here because i was looking for a place\n                  that i felt uncomfortable about being in the states i studied\n                  a lot on the states and i starting learning about all these\n                  things wrong with the government all of these people call it conspiracy there is no conspiracy it is\n                  a fact it is going on it is happening i have\n                  seen way too many bits and pieces with my own eyes like what\n                  i just described about the fort lauderdale airport you know i saw that with my own eyes this was way before 9/11 but\n                  i saw one of the things i did not mention that i saw there which was really what made me uncomfortable flying the planes\n                  was no big deal though i thought that it was very reckless\n                  and irresponsible of our government of the us government running remote-controlled planes in that area what if one\n                  of those things should crash it would kill a whole bunch of\n                  people you know yet they were pretty damn confident that\n                  that was not a problem but what really caught my attention there is something really\n                  going on  and this falls into the category of those things\n                  you hear about conspiracies and let me regress here a little\n                  bit a long time ago maybe about 30 years ago i ran into one\n                  of those so-called underground newspapers and i was so outraged that i saved the newspaper to burn it i mean i wanted to\n                  make sure that i burned it so it would never end up in the\n                  hands of someone else and read such utterly crap against the\n                  us government i mean that is how programmed i was to\n                  believe the us government was the best thing in the world and i was brought up to us was the best thing on the planet you know everyone else was evil bad russia we got a problem all these other countries are bad but we were the best and later on throughout life you know i have been finding\n                  bits and pieces that start confirming the things that that\n                  newspaper said were true you know if you confirm 10 20 30 40 eventually you realize that most likely 99% of what\n                  it said was true i was trying to figure out how you ended up down\n                  here oh so i wanted to mention the thing about the\n                  airport one of the pieces that confirmed that newspaper being\n                  true i was sitting there in the airport and these guys come\n                  in i cannot identify them from which country but i\n                  assume some arab middle east countries and some fellow there that i do not know what ranking but he had plenty of color on his uniform insignias etcetera to show that he was a fairly high-ranking officer and with\n                  him came a security squadron well for goodness sakes i mean to go have a sandwich and\n                  a soft drink there was one or two guys with m60s you name\n                  it all sorts of full jacketed bullet-proof jackets hand\n                  grenades all sorts of rifles you know a variety of high-powered\n                  rifles it is like my who is this guy you\n                  know but the thing is we are talking usa fort lauderdale florida what on earth is this fellow doing in the airport you know having a drink and this was a common thing where\n                  these people would come into the cafeteria with an unbelievable\n                  squadron of military protection ok and you are saying his nationality was\n                  middle eastern somewhere yeah i have no idea from where and\n                  they spoke some other language that i did not recognize but\n                  the thing is you start saying what are these people doing\n                  on usa soil you know what are they doing there you know and then when you hear the 9/11 you go hmm ah yeah and when you start reading all these other stories you start saying yeah well what are these people actually\n                  doing there ok so what but anyhow all of those things put together and\n                  seeing all these chaotic situations in the states at one point\n                  i came and i visited south america and i felt good i felt\n                  the vibration here it felt happy it felt great i also realized with my wealth at the time that i could\n                  live here and never work again so that is what i have\n                  done you know i have not had to work in years and years i have been retired and i have been able to diverge into studying spiritual\n                  subjects which is what really has tickled my fancy you know where do we come from what are we doing here what is\n                  our purpose in life where are we going so i spend quite a bit of time doing the things i want to\n                  do versus those over there you know having a huge house\n                  and multiple cars and getting a new car every year and airplane and all these things are not truly necessary to have a good quality\n                  of life there is nothing wrong with having them but\n                  what is wrong is you know just working around the clock\n                  to have these things that are not truly necessary ok but well are your parents alive i will answer that after off the record ok you had some questions?rs\u2019s colleague you were talking about being\n                  involved with training well i cannot remember what brought\n                  this up anyway you had experience with someone following\n                  you around oh yeah yeah that is happened a couple of\n                  times and this is more pieces of the puzzle i have\n                  pieced together i just remember one that i have not mentioned my best\n                  friend in the states being heavily spied on and no logical\n                  reason behind it but you know people that lived on one side\n                  of his apartment were spying on him the other side apartment\n                  spying on him yet he was my best friend makes no sense no\n                  reason why to spy on him no reason why to spy on me.here when i got to south america i had an alphabet soup i do not know i always assumed it was cia but it was\n                  some british intelligence in there too just following me everywhere and i just got so sick and tired of it because you know one of these following me around and one of these stupidities someone can get hurt you know they might just turn on you in a dark alley when\n                  you are getting out of the car or something you might\n                  hurt someone or you may end up getting hurt so it is\n                  what seems like a stupid thing someone following you you\n                  say well so what someone following you can turn\n                  into a violent situation especially when you know these people\n                  are armed and they are dangerous how do you know these people were following you oh my goodness they were the worst of the worst i mean it was like you know like amateurs i mean\n                  really really really low-class amateurs so it was impossible\n                  not to know and it was just a nonstop of them so i grabbed a few of them one day and i just sat \u2019em\n                  down and says look stop this bullshit enough is enough i know you are cia i know you are following they said no we look do not try to bullshit i know who you are you know who i am enough is enough i am not doing\n                    anything here that is of any interest to any government so i tell you what we can get in that car right now you\n                    can search my car you can search my house you can search\n                    me you can search whatever the hell you want but get off\n                    my back because there is nothing of any interest to anyone i do not do anything that has any interest for anyone so please my door is open you just come knock any day knock on the door and say hi this is cia i know you\n                    gave us authorization to you know search everywhere you\n                    know and while they kept on saying no no no i says look you cannot bullshit me because i know where\n                    you are coming from so enough is enough and one of them says well ok next day they all\n                  disappear from here you know a group of about 20 or 30 of \u2019em they just totally disappear now they have replaced them with another group but this\n                  new group keeps a very more professional you know more\n                  low-profile more intelligent not being obviously noticed you know and i have identified at least a half a dozen of \u2019em and i do not care and i went up to them again and i have done it with every single official here you\n                  know i have taken a written letter and i have walked\n                  up to every single one of \u2019em the chief of police the\n                  military general the military colonels the mayor the governor every single one of them i have gone and visited and i have said

the beginning this happened within the first year yeah first\n                  year that i was here and i do not know maybe they suspected you know foreigner moves over here maybe they typed some\n                  name in some computer somewhere they followed it checking\n                  it out whatever they do not know if one is truly up\n                  to something you know maybe they thought i am part of\n                  some group or something i have heard there is a secret military base in peru\n                  here that the us keeps a secret military base in peru  for\n                  i do not know what but i have heard that a couple\n                  times there is a massive ufo presence here what about that mountain it has a really strange\n                  structure on top yeah i saw a ufo there once very very small one oh we can go for hours on the ufo thing i mean it is\n                  just yeah i mean because you say you astral travel right yeah consciously not as much as i would like i think we all have\n                  problems with that yeah i have astral traveled many times consciously so by the way this fellow that i am talking being a victim of he also astral traveled consciously but\n                  guided and controlled mm hm he traveled all over many places many things but most of the time being totally controlled and one of the\n                  things that he was getting good at was being able to teleport\n                  small devices and he teleported little things into my bedroom and to be able to astrally attack people if he wanted to he\n                  asked permission to experiment with others including myself and he was getting good at it and i think that is part of the things that was very very very dangerous that this guy was trying to they were\n                  losing control of him he was trying to do things on his own like astral travel consciously and breaking off the control mm hm do you have an implant maybe that is a possibility not that i know about maybe meaning you do not know\n                  if you do or \u201cmaybe meaning you do not want\n                  to answer my question maybe  i do not know if i do but i do have\n                  some suspicions i have the suspicion there is one here and a suspicion of one possibly over here mm hm i have also had surgeries that i did not need and i lost some mental abilities in one of those surgeries what do you mean i feel that i came to this world with considerably\n                  better mental abilities than the ones that i have right now really so i feel that some damage was done the story that\n                  i was told is that i was pronounced dead for 6 minutes i mean my heart had stopped for 6 minutes but putting all these\n                  pieces together one starts now seeing conspiracies perhaps\n                  where they are not but you start wondering when you say what was the event that caused you\n                  to lose consciousness that caused you to have the surgery\n                  that you did not need when i was a child my parents were convinced that\n                  i needed a surgery that i did not need really and my gullible parents went along with it for\n                  whatever reason but i ended up in a hospital with a major\n                  surgery that i did not need and i have had two surgeries possibly three surgeries in my life that i did not need how did the other ones happen an alleged tumor over here which i still have after\n                  the surgery a tumor over here which also i mean were you not voluntary i mean obviously\n                  you must have checked yourself into the hospital oh yeah totally voluntary as a child you do what\n                  your parents tell you to do you know you are talking about all of this happened\n                  as a child or as an adult as a child not as an adult no no not as an adult and i have always been\n                  curious one of the parts does not come because one\n                  of the things is too many of these things have gravitated\n                  around me to be just coincidence and a chip would be a nice\n                  way to know where the heck you are who you are what your\n                  level is or what they want you for then you have got\n                  things with the last names.i am if you looked it up i am part of royalty you know it traces from one of these royalty bloodlines which\n                  kind of makes you wonder you know there is a lot of\n                  these bloodlines people think of the bloodlines of the high-caliber people but you have also got to have your bloodlines for your\n                  slaves and that dna is really important to track it and know because that dna is more or less programmable than another or more or less useful for something so last names is an easy way to track a lot of things about\n                  a lot of people and i would not doubt that there is databases\n                  that follow something to do with last names and at any station they can get a drop of blood out of you in any situation and you know there is probably a heck of a lot more information\n                  in a drop of blood your last name is what oh well not on tape the jesuit and the other colleagues came out listen guys we have different problems one is the coming of planet x another one is that other people decided to do something in the countries of the world we doubt the knowledge of the people and maybe these people are responsible for the situation that we are facing now maybe - this is my point of view - maybe 9/11 is related to this i cannot imagine that the only reasons for which united states of america are losing so many lives of his sons you know young guys soldiers and killing civilians by chance - not by chance - and losing their reputation in front of the world because in the last years after 9/11 the us administration lost so many reputation because of its decisions i cannot imagine that the only reasons are economics are you know taking advantage of the fuel no it is not possible of course a lot of money you know this is one reason but you know i am sure that the 9/11 planet x and this possible structure are pieces of one big puzzle this is my opinion a conversation with gorbachev  you have a picture behind you of a man yes and i would like you to tell us the story that you told us earlier yes on your left over there there is my formal identification card of a meeting which took place in venice on a venice island in the venetian lagoon in june 2006 the title was media - between citizens and power i was correspondent for gruppo editoriale olimpia who published several magazines two of them are tecnologia & difesa (technology & defense and another one is ufo notiziario for which i wrote several articles until 2006 for these two magazines tecnologia & difesa (technology & defense and ufo notiziario i was colleagues from them in those days so i participated to the press conference held by mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev in june 2006 and i was so lucky that i found a little space to make questions to the former president of soviet union and when i took the microphone you know or he is not interested or he wants to change the subject.but the most important thing is that later on in october 2006 if i remember he was hosted by a television program on that occasion in front of the italian public on tv in front of the journalists - because all the journalists had a factor at that time - asked him something about ufos and his conversation with reagan he recollect him he remembered you know those days and he told you know a little bit more about the meeting with ronald reagan and what ronald reagan said to him about a possible threat at that time you know there was a cold war in the soviet union and the united states of america could not find you know anything that can stop the cold war gorbachev said in front of the italian public on  that time we were in the garden of the villa in geneva in november 1985 and we were discussing a lot you know and during a private conversation we were walking at a certain point ronald reagan stopped and said listen to me gorbachev but if now suddenly from the space there was an attack from somewhere can we put our forces together can we stay together and gorbachev said i do not know what you think but yes i think we can do it they are not the exact words that he said but this is the meaning what does it mean it means that in the middle you know of difficult times - there was the cold war there was the iron curtain - ronald reagan and gorbachev in an official meeting you know they talked about a possible alien threat to the humankind to the mankind to the humanity and gorbachev did not deny this kerry\ncassidy (kc i am kerry cassidy from project camelot i am\nhere with miriam delicado and we are absolutely overjoyed to see\nmiriam alive and looking so well after her auto accident she is\ndoing this as a follow-up interview because she has some things to\nsay about the times we are in and what people need to be\nmindful of so go ahead miriam miriam\ndelicado (md thank you kerry i just want to make a little note\nto say thank you to everyone for all of their support since this car\naccident i am recovering very quickly as a result of all this\nhealing energy that is being shared in\nfact that sort of leads me in to one of the things that i wanted to\ntalk about today with everyone and that is how we really need to\nstep things up we need to step things up as a community we need to\nstep things up in unity and make our voices a lot stronger than they\nhave been it is\nvery clear to me how this network of people that are working in this\nlight\nin order to educate in order to inform and in order to bring about\nchange for humanity and the earth  are really connected to one\nanother i have\nhad so many people through this accident communicate with me and the\nway that they are hearing about it and the channels that they are\nhearing about it is fantastic so it is a really positive part\nof this that i have learned very very clearly and\nin saying that i know that this particular time that we are in\nis very delicate and it is truly the time\nof choice i have been talking about this time\nof choice\nalmost since i became public but we are fully moving into a time\nwhere difficulties are starting to arise for individuals communities families and we need to pay closer attention to what it\nis that we as the individuals are doing every\nday of your life you have choices and i have talked about this\nwith you in the past but this\nchoice has to do with how well you are going to form the bonds\nbetween the people in your life and people in your community community\nmeans this community of lightworkers people that are working to\neducate what\nsteps are you going to take in order to bring about disclosure of\nthis very very important subject matter and not only in the area of\nufos and ets and aliens and all of these things but really disclosure of what is happening in our world right now and what is\ngoing to happen what\nis it that the scientists actually know what is it that the\nphilosophers have known for a very long time and what is it that the\nindigenous people have known and do know at this very time this\npoint of disclosure that i am talking about is coming it needs\nto come from all directions and that includes the individual so if you have a story to tell it is time to start sharing it because if you continue to remain silent then we as a people are\nnot going to be able to move forward we are not going to be able to\novercome any great difficulties that may be challenging us in the\nfuture i\nknow  and have known for 21 years  that this particular time that\nwe are in right now i call it a time\nof insanity when people are completely losing their rational selves we\nneed to be very very careful of whom we align ourselves with whom\nwe form friendships with whom we associate with even for someone as\nconnected and in sync as i am i have still had situations in the\npast year and the last six months where i have allowed people to\ncome into my life who were very destructive and harmful so\nthis is something that was shared with me a very long time ago by the\ntall blondes they have restated to me numerous times in the past\nyear to be very aware of my surroundings aware of whom i am\nassociating with and that i needed to not be distracted these\npeople are coming into our lives to distract us from speaking from\ntelling our stories from being strong in our communities from being\nthe change \u2013 and that means anything from writing your\ncongressman to say i\nwant disclosure to creating a community garden and collecting heritage seeds \u2013\nwhich by the way is going to become more and more and more\ndifficult i\nhave continually talked to people about collecting their heritage and\nheirloom seeds i am telling you that if you do not have\nyour seeds today it is almost too late because new laws are being\nformed all over the planet \u2013 and that includes all over in\nnorth america \u2013 where legislation is being brought in for\norganic farming to be almost you know illegal collecting of seeds illegal and maybe the next step is the owning\nof heritage seeds so if we as a community do not take a stand as one voice and one people\nfor one earth we may as well just sit back relax and wait for the\nend no longer can anyone turn around and say that they can be\ncomplacent about anything and i mean anything\nthat is going on right now different\norganizations different groups around the world know what is\ncoming they are making preparations for it pay attention open\nyour eyes look at the news is it telling you anything no it is\ntalking about gossip dig deeper and look\nat what it is that is happening with seed banks around the\nworld with where the money\u2019s flowing who is in control\nof our finances and how that money is being distributed and\nlet us think about this how\nmuch money has gone missing with governments not only in north\namerica south america but around the globe where is that money\nbeing funneled into pay\nattention pay attention to these things because they are going\nto be keys to be able to lead you to some very very serious answers now i strongly suggest you have your seeds  that you have your\npreparations that you connect with those that you need to connect\nwith because if something horrible does happen in your community or\nin your area you will be fine you can have peace in your heart knowing that you have already made steps to communicate and to open\nyour heart to your neighbor really this is not about digging bunkers and you know going and\nhiding from the world this is really about opening yourself up to\nthe world and to what it is that is coming so\nthis is a really strong message to not be blindsided by all of these\ndistractions that are around us right now this\ntime of i call it the time\nof insanity\nhitting us and what we are moving through people rational\npeople are becoming irrational spiritual people are becoming\nvicious and confused and vindictive and\non the flip side people that were vindictive and this type of focus\nin their lives of just materialism are completely flipping and\nbecoming spiritual so pay attention to who you are associating\nwith if\nyou have an open heart it is one of the ways of being able to\nwalk through this very difficult time if you are completely\nconfused about the people around you stop and meditate it is\ngoing to be able to bring your body your mind and your spirit back\ninto alignment of who you are and what your intended purpose is here\non earth at this time many\nof the people that come to project camelot in particular are very\nfocused on details scientific details and this type of thing it is\ngreat to have that but at the very very end of all of this science\nis something that the indigenous people themselves understand \u2013\nand that is energy and how it actually works so always remember to remain in your heart through this process because if you cannot remain in your heart then no matter how\nmuch knowledge and information you have it is not going to do\nanything for you by\nremaining in your heart you are going to be connected to the\nright people you are going to make the right decisions and\nchoices and you are most importantly going to bring about\nchange quickly and rapidly if\nthis community made the choice of any one particular matter and that\nis for example disclosure and every single person on project\ncamelot that ever entered into any one of those videos \u2013\nwhether it be on the website on youtube on different websites \u2013\nand said okay i am going to take 20 minutes of my day and write a very quick\nletter to my congressman asking him or her to bring about disclosure the power of that one single step would be extraordinary now there\u2019re a lot of issues that have been coming up for a number\nof people over the course of the last year one of the big questions\nthat people keep asking me about personally is swine flu and\nvaccines and plagues and what it is that is coming listen the bottom line is that it is eventual  it is not a question of if\n it is a question of when\nthese things will take place is\nit going to take place in the next day i do not know in\nthe next year i do not know but\ni can tell you this that no matter what we choose to do we must\nremember that one of the greatest powers that we have is to remain in\nbalance with nature and mother earth it\nis not going to be through the sciences that we find the cure for an\nillness that was derived from nature it is within ourselves that we\nare going to be able to do that if\nsomeone walked up to you and they walked out of a factory that is\nhad poison and you know you saw all the signs and there is\npoison symbols everywhere and they walk in with their plastic suits\nand they walk back out and they give you an apple and they hold it\nup to you and you say great i am hungry can i have that are you really going to eat that apple that walked out of a building\nthat is creating poison it\nlooks good and they are going to tell you it is good but\nit is up to you to decide whether or not it is actually\ngoing to be right for you or not no one\u2019s going to give you\nthe answer you need to go inside if\nyou are meant to be here for the entire path of your life then you\nknow until you are old and you are fortunate enough to\nhave those gray hairs move in then that is great and if you are\nnot you could walk out of the house and get hit by a car like i did\na couple weeks ago we never know truly what is going to happen\nin our lives no matter how connected you are so what you need to do is remain in your heart and you need to remain\nclear in that and know that the community that you are in this\ncommunity in particular is of lightworkers of scientists of\nphilosophers of seers all of these different areas of artists this community cares so\ni am saying take some action because the next year that i am\ntelling you about is going to get worse it is going to get more\ndifficult there is going to be more financial problems there is\ngoing to be more difficulty for you to feed your families for you to\nbuy new shoes for your children and it is okay because you\nknow what we are all going through that the\nway that we are going to be able to get through is to\ncommunicate and have community with one another and to work within\nthose structures that are not working for us \u2013 not to tear them\ndown and crush them throw them away  but to work with what we\ncurrently have and just make our voices heard all\nwe need to do is make our voices heard write a letter ask for\ndisclosure start asking questions dig deeper and start making some\naction okay i want to go to a different area miriam and that was very\nwell said by the way i want to find out whether or not you want to\nmake any kind of statement about the need for indigenous people to\ncome forward at this time because this is a great opportunity and\nyou do not know who might be watching thank you kerry you know we have had numerous conversations\nsince we have met and everyone out there knows that i have a very\nclose connection to indigenous people the connection that i have is\nfrom my heart it is from my mind it is actually from my\nsoul it\nis critical it is critical that the indigenous cultures around the world come\ntogether i\nhave a fear almost and i do not say that often but i do i\nhave almost a shaking feeling with this that is of great concern because they are running around and i see it happening they are\ntrying to make those connections and bridge the gaps and bring the\nvoice but there are so many people who are white people getting in\nthe way of that voice coming together even\nwithin indigenous communities and indigenous cultures there is a lot\nof ego involved a lot of these cultures are talking about the\nfeminine being brought forward and yet this is something that still\nhas not been fully accepted by them themselves even though they are\ntalking about it we are\nrunning out of time on this earth we are running out of this\ntime\nof choice we are still in it and there is still hope but the indigenous\ncultures need to come together in the public eye unified this is\nnot going to happen from white people stepping forward and planning\nand organizing this is from the indigenous cultures themselves we\nare going to be there to assist them in this change to work\ntogether to bridge that gap between the balance of nature and what\nit is that we have here in the structured world what we have\nbuilt we\nneed to come together that means that on both sides we need to set\ncertain things aside and say that we no longer have the need for\nthis and that these things do not have to completely change and\nflip you know not everyone on earth needs to go and live in the\njungle and not everyone in the jungle needs to come out here and\nlive in this world but\nwhat is it that both parties could learn from one another that is\nwhere the open heart needs to come in even within the indigenous\ncultures themselves every\nsingle day of my life in the past year and a half almost two years has been focused on trying to bring that energy \u2013 these people\ncoming together but unfortunately i have experienced some\nvery very very dark and i mean dark energies that have been coming forward through people to stop this\nprocess from happening and\none of the things that i can say about the indigenous world is that\ni am not easily fooled so when i hear someone say a word that\nsays heart i expect to feel it in mine and if i do not feel it in mine then i am not listening to what they are saying because\nthey are speaking with a tongue that is a lie so the indigenous cultures need to come together and they need to do it\nquickly because the situation on this earth with disease with\npoverty with starvation with natural disasters with political\nstructures with economic structures  all these things are being\nbroken down they are crumbling because they are not\nworking so if we do not step forward as the one voice for one people for\none world we are not going to have one earth left \u2013 not\nwith human beings on it this\nis not about saving humanity it is not even about saving\nthe earth it is really about saving ourselves and making the\nchoice as far as what path we want to take so if anyone wants to begin building that bridge in order to create that\nwith the indigenous world i am here and i have friends i have\ncontacts in different parts of the world who are also preparing to\nmake that happen yes and camelot is also here with our cameras and with our team\nthat has joined us as of late and we will go anywhere to film any\nkinds of messages that those people want to put out there we are\nstanding right behind you in thinking that this is the time when we outside in the outside world would love to hear from the indigenous\npeople who have been sort of the guardians of the earth for all these\nyears for all the you know millions of years that humanity has\nbeen occupying this lovely planet and the time is now and so i\nsecond that well what i would love to see happen kerry is some of these\ncultures that are trying to get their messages out to the world to\nreally understand that they need to stop being distracted themselves instead\nof relying on one individual or one group they really need to open\nthe doorway to any and all of them instead of having people come and\njust happen upon them to just really say okay i am here now come to me i am ready to speak i am\nready to share the\nindigenous world has knowledge that the scientific world is just\nbeginning to understand great i have had understandings of the\nuniverse and how it works and mathematics and astrophysics and so\nforth for years it\ndoes not do anything not until we begin to share that and how\ndo you share it you can only share it through your heart you can\nonly share it when you become vocal and you begin to use those two\nthings in sync with one another to be able to bring about that\nchange we\nhave to start looking at the basics we have to be able to start\nlooking at our families our communities our infrastructure our\nfood our environment basics look at them what can you do and\ntake action there is absolutely no more time to be sitting on the\ncouch you have to get up so i want to just say let us move things forward and let us\nget to work and if there\u2019re any of you out there who are able\nto assist in any way to bring these indigenous cultures together i am\nhere project camelot\u2019s here there\u2019re a lot of other\npeople that are standing with us let us\nstart making this happen so that we can create what i have\ntalked about from the beginning which is a world gathering of\nhumanity thank you miriam that is a lovely message why do not\nyou give your website so that people can contact you and an email\naddress and we will also print it on the screen my website address is www.alienbluestar.com\nand you can email me at miriam@alienbluestar.com\nand i am looking forward to hearing from all of you thank you very much kerry\ncassidy\n(kc marcia schafer herself is a contactee and a very gifted\nintuitive she has amazing gifts and information to share with you\nfrom her contacts she is\nwritten one book confessions\nof an intergalactic anthropologist and it is available on her website which is www.beyondzebra.com i have\nread her book it is a fascinating book it is well worth\nthe time i encourage you to read it it is a lovely lovely\nbook she is actually an old soul and i have to say that i know\nher from other lives anyway this is marcia schafer she is also bob dean\u2019s partner and\ni am not supposed to say that in the lead i know marcia\nlaughs] so i am saying it at the end of my introduction i\nwant you to take note marcia schafer she\nis also an executive i am not sure how you had term it maybe an executive coach i am going to let her characterize\nthat herself speak\nto me marcia and let us make sure that your mic is working marcia\nschafer (ms hello everybody okay marcia i will let you take it from here okay well thank you all for coming and thank you for having me when kerry first invited me i said you\nknow i am not really so sure i should be here i am really\nnot a whistleblower i do not do conspiracy and\nshe sa  no no no we want you to be a part of this so\ni sa  all\nright i will give it a shot so\nwith that we were supposed to put in our biographies and our\npictures and i have got to tell you i got a little bit upset\nbecause i did not get it in on time and kerry and bill went into\nthe old archives and pulled something themselves and i just thought\nit was totally inappropriate but i am going to let you folks\ndecide as we begin to talk about metamorphosis so\nthis is what they put up of me and my bio [shows slide of a picture\ntaken behind her]  marcia\ntried to rekindle her modeling career but sadly in the intervening\nyears everything had gotten a bit pear-shaped so\ni learned to be on time with my stuff okay what i am going to start with is an old vedic saying well all\nright it is not an old vedic saying i got it on the internet but still it is good and it is worth sharing it is a\nstory about the bull and the crow you may have heard it but it is worth repeating particularly\nhere and today there\nwas the bull in a meadow that was watching an old crow stumble along\nand he saw that the crow had no energy and was really struggling he\nwalked over to the crow and he sa  crow come here i know how to fix what is wrong with you the\ncrow looked up at the bull and sa  what and\nhe sa you\njust have to do what i say and you have to do it for three days\nstraight the\ncrow looked up at him and he sa  well okay and\nthe bull looked down and he sa  all\nright you have got to eat that the\ncrow looked up at the bull and sa  you are\nkidding me right the\nbull sa  no crow you must for three days straight crow\nsa  i\nam so not eating your poo bull bull\nlooked down and sa  do\nyou want to get better you must do it so\nthe crow sa  i am\ndying anyway  what have i got to lose for\nthree days he ate the feces from the bull and at the end of three\ndays you know what the crow got strong and he was able to fly once\nagain to the highest trees so\nhe took off and he landed in this huge pine tree and right below him unbeknownst to him as he landed on the branch along came a hunter the\nhunter happened to look up see the crow go  i\nhate those damn crows pow shot the crow and\nthe moral of the story bullshit can take\nyou to the top but it cannot keep you there and\ni thought that there\u2019re so many people crowing about so much\nbullshit these days that that was the perfect thing to open up with so\ni mean look everybody is nervous these days you are hearing\nall this talk about 2012 and this old mayan legacy that is been\nleft to us and people are scared that armageddon is just around the\ncorner earth\nchanges \u2013 should\ni head for the hills where should i go is there going to be water food where should i take my family people\nare giving you all their channeled information and their channeled\nprophesies and telling you that this\nis the truth and we must do what i am saying because it is\ncoming from beyond extraterrestrial\ninvasions \u2013 people are telling you that all sorts of things are\nabout to unfold with extraterrestrials so\nkerry was trying to tell you what i do i am actually a business\nconsultant of a very unusual type because i also use my psychic\nabilities and my experiences with extraterrestrial contact with\npeople in over 30 countries helping them become humanitarian\npioneers but\ni tell you by the time they come to me they usually look like\nthis shows slide of a man freaking out hands on the sides of his\nface screaming] from everything that is going on audience\nlaughter] it is a tough road for them to take so\nas we begin to talk about things what is really important to me\ntoday and one of the biggest messages i can give you is that we have\nto talk about what\nis truth because everybody tries to give you their version of truth you know who has the authority to say that they have the only version of it your\njob as you listen to each of us just because we are up here\ndoes not mean anything and especially me i have lived the life\ni am about to tell you about and had the experiences i am\nabout to tell you about i know they are real because i went\nthrough it you do not know me from adam you do not know\nthat you\nhave got to develop your discretionary abilities to a very very high\nlevel and just listen to everything and synthesize it into what may\nmake sense to you as we go forward just\nbecause you think an extraterrestrial may be the source or some\nchanneled angel does not necessarily make it the barometer by\nwhich you should live your lives so question me in particular and\njust look at it as a particular journey you have\nall had extraordinary experiences or been exposed to them to some\ndegree or you would not be spending $150 bucks for this weekend i can assure you of that so you know that a lot of this stuff is\ngoing to be commonplace to some of you but i just cannot stress\nenough how important it is that you all really just put on your truth\nbarometer and figure out what is right for you so what my job is is to teach you to think smartly\nbecause thinking smartly is a hybrid approach and it is using both\nthe intellect (the cognitive processes and the wisdom of your\nintuitive knowing this\nmay sound like some very nice new age preachiness but in my work\nwith people as i am turning them on to putting on their higher\nswitches this is something that we really get into because in the\nhuman condition it is extraordinarily unique the\ncognitive functioning the intellectual reasoning that you have when you combine that with your eternal soul-mind and your eternal\nsoul-knowing you have a very very powerful tool to decipher\nreality but we do not flicker them on together all the time \u2013\nwe use them separately or one at the exclusion of the other so i\nwant you to be thinking with your head\nand your heart\nat all times now as we begin we really need to be looking at we are talking\nabout god you know the change and all these things happening are\nthese changing times right now to some degree yes they are but\nwe have had change happening throughout history but what is\nunique is that we have had change at an unprecedented level particularly over the past 50 100 years now we have had beautiful green environments and healthy living and\nwe have turned around and we have trashed it to where our\nlifestyles are so polluted worldwide our food chain is tainted\nbeyond belief our breathing is fouled by the stench of horribly\nputrid air and everything that we touch basically is not in a very\ngood spot but\nwe are talking about this weekend change on an unprecedented\nlevel that everybody\u2019s thinking that this amazing thing is\ngoing to be happening and happening very soon so\nis there really any change that is going on for us yes i had\nsay there is i mean you have got to make up your own minds i\nknow a lot of you already believe it but i had say there is and\nthat it is on three levels now\nas i said i am working with people in over 30 countries these\nare not people who you will necessarily see to your left and your\nright at a conference like this these are everyday people who are\nbeginning to have some very profound things happen to them that they\nare waking up to a new degree they are having paranormal\nexperiences some are having extraterrestrial contact and\nthese are people that are in you know whether they are a\njudge a lawyer an executive a head of an agency a doctor a\nbiochemical researcher a housewife bringing up six kids you know a\ncollege student i have worked with people from 9 to 93 one of\nmy favorites is the 93-year-old she sends me the dirtiest stuff on\nthe internet i just cannot believe it she is a\nhoot but she is extremely aware and she actually had a very\nprestigious occupation in her life so\nsomething is going on in personal change because we have come\nfrom a very strong emphasis of getting more stuff \u2013 you know going to macy\u2019s they are having a sale on saturday \u2013\nto really taking time out to find that inner focus and what is\nactually important to us we are\nalso seeing change on a social level there are a lot of things\nhappening where are the majority of people still going about not\ngoing paying attention you betcha but there is a tremendous stream\nof awakening happening in everyday life in every society where\npeople are again beginning to look at things very differently and\nyou hear so much about the young there\u2019re still the same old\nkids doing the same old things that we did but some of these\nyoungsters are extremely wise and extremely aware and are talking\nabout things that i just never talked about when i was young and most\nof my friends did not either they are\nlooking at life with very sage elder eyes they know what they want\nto do they feel like they have a purpose to their life at eight\nyears old they are going out and starting businesses and\nbeginning to do new things but\nas we look at all this change again i want to remind you that we have\nalways\nhad change you know there was time where we would see the vikings\ncome in on the shore and go holy\ncow sound the alarm we had be afraid of the loss of our civilization and what was\nhappening this is just another phase in our development but\nthere is another aspect to change there is planetary\nchange we are looking at things around us on the environment i\nwas really shocked to see the this [shows slide of the front page of\nthe ny times] on the new\nyork times august 9th this headline some of you may have seen it front\npage climate\nchange now not only is it climate change look what is below seen\nas threat to us security pentagon studies issue crisis may\ndestabilize regions and require military action whoa you know that is something you had think you had\nsee on project camelot so people are paying attention to\nsome degree to the planetary change even though some still try to\ndeny it but\nwhat is going on with this global warming and is it something that is\nhappening here on the planet or is it something that could be further\non beyond because we tend to stop when we think about things and we\ntend to think about our direct parameters around us and the world but\nwhat is going on out there in that unseen vast void of the universe we think of the world like this shows slide of a normal-looking\nearth then a slide showing electromagnetic fields around the earth]\nbut there is all kind of fields and properties around the planet\nthat we really do not pay much attention to that we need to be\ntaking a look at that could be influencing us from beyond the borders\nof our planet and what is going on but\nat the fundamental heart of this metamorphosis and this change that is\ntaking place is something that is a little bit different now and it is not necessarily a 2012 prophecy it is not\nnecessarily extraterrestrial visitation it is\nsomething very very obvious and in front of us and what is changing\nare the perspectives that people have we are now able to look at\nthings very differently because life has changed around us so we\nhave new tools of interpretation when\ni first came out i think it was 12 13 years ago to publicly talk\nabout having a lifetime of extraterrestrial contact and what i\nlearned there was still a bit of trepidation on behalf of people there were those people who said yeah i think it is probably true i want to hear what she has to say and\nthere was still a great degree of people who did not want to\nhear anything but\nnow the majority of people are saying well you know i have not had those experiences myself but i think\nit is probably quite likely that it is out there because we have got media we have got technology we have\nall kinds of tools to help us reinterpret reality and what we have\ngot going on around us so\nwe still have two camps we have people who are looking at things\nthat  perspectives from the conventional eyes the economy finances mortgage institutions politics relationships powerbrokers technology but\nthen we have people like who are looking at  unconventional world\nin terms of what is it that science does not tell us what is\nreally going on with space and solar activity what is happening\nout there with cosmic radiation and how does it affect us i mean for gosh sakes if a sun an orb billions of years away can turn my\nskin brown then obviously if there is radiation fields and\nactivity out there that i am not aware of it can\ninfluence me and influence me at depths and levels i am not\naware of we are\nredefining extraterrestrial reality so many of you are having your\nown experiences and we have heard different interpretations\nabout human evolution and who we are and who we have been consciousness\nis taking a radical new leap as we are looking at it beyond\nfreud beyond jung and into some new levels and some new depths as\nyou are exploring who you are and what you can do and certainly\nthe historical redacts of looking at our history on this planet of\nwho we have been and who we can be quality\nof life is taking precedence over some other things that are there like making money and having a 401k and\nmost importantly there is a huge flow of your paranormal skill-set\nbeing turned on within a subgroup of the population it is not\nhappening with everybody but it is happening with quite a few as you know in your own experiences that you are able to see know and hear things and have extra abilities that were once\nrelegated to jeane dixon and just a few who were out there so\nwhat am i doing with all of this information that has been given to\nme because as kerry said i have had as some of you may know kind of an odd lifetime and i have had the opportunity to learn a\nlot of information \u2013 not from books not from going to\nconferences \u2013 but from extraterrestrials and entities who\nare not native to our planet now\ni will tell you if i had not had these experiences myself i had be looking at that woman up there and going she is\nwhacked i just cannot relate but when they become personalized then there is no doubt about\nit about what happened and so i have had a very unconventional\ncurriculum some\nof the things that i am going to briefly touch on today in the\ntime that we have are i have been introduced to the soul life as\na primary underlying force of our existence and being made to\nunderstand that there is something more than just who we are i have\nmet \u201cthe family in terms of many different species and\nraces out there i have\nbeen introduced to some new things about genetics consciousness looked at history in a way that has not quite been looked at\nbefore and\nmost importantly that has given me the understanding of what we have\ndone a lot here on earth and why we do not understand things is\na new interpretation of what we call time-space this\nis all leading up to what i have been taught is that what the\nfuture can be and that the future is not set in stone and\nso what i have done is i am planting seeds of people around the\nworld rather than saying buy\nmy book read my book oh i want to get on oprah trust me i do not want to get on oprah and i do not want\nanybody reading my book it does not belong in costco or any place\nlike that so you know i have decided to work with people on an individual\nbasis in giving them the seeds and the skills and the talent that\nthey need to be successful to go forward and flower a new life now\nobviously in the little amount of time we have i cannot cover\nall those things but i am going to try to emphasize the soul\nlife our futures and planting seeds along with some of these other\nthings now you know when it comes to extraterrestrial reality it is kind\nof for those of you who have not had the direct contact there is kind of that \u201clet us do lunch kind of\nattitude towards it i\nget people calling me up or leaving messages saying can\nyou arrange it is almost like match.com can\nyou arrange for me to meet with an extraterrestrial with a list of attributes that it is like i am running a\ndating service it does not work that way it does not\nwork that way at all you\nknow there are so many different races out there that unfortunately\nwe tend to get confined to the beliefs that are fed to us by the\nmedia so we are used to the little grays you know some\nchanneled information about reptilians but do not be limited to\nthat there are many many different life-forms out there some with\nclassical types of civilizations and cultures and some who are way\nbeyond that the\nslides that you are looking at now these are life forms from\nhere this is life from the\nocean now tell me if that is not strange you know how can we\nkind of look at what is out there and say gosh\nit just does not fit into my paradigm of reality we\nhave all different types of life and as i am going to hit on in\na little bit that it is all sentient and what i have\nlearned \u2013 it is all conscious because as i have\nlearned through my contacts with extraterrestrials they also opened\nup my capacity to communicate with the animal world and to realize\nhow sophisticated they are and what they have going on so\nas we look at life that is around us we cannot really say\nthat this is really that much more strange now i think we need to talk a little bit about their communication and\nwhat they have to say because this is really important what i want\nto do is i want to give you some benefit of the wisdom that i have\ngained from working with a lot of different races i\nthink there is a joke in the universe \u2013 you know it is\nkind of like \u201chow does the chicken cross the road how\ndo you get a human to do anything the answer is\nplay to his ego tell him he is special he is an\nambassador we will give him any appointment he wants he will\ndo anything we want and this is so true you have\nso often seen people who have been so enamored of having whether it is a channeled situation or they have had a\ncontact face-to-face situation and they get some information they\ngo running out they want to be on a talk radio show or they want to\nbe in the media and we are\ngoing to have contact at 3 pm on august 12 it will be a meteor going\nby and if you look really hard you will see them over and over again it never happens and\nso what i have found whether we like it or not i feel that there is\nalmost like a fraternity hazing that goes on with some of us who have\nthis type of situation because when you find you do not\nnecessarily fall into that and you question what is going on and you try to wake up your cognitive processing as you are in\nthis sometimes fugue state as you are with them they gain they give you respect when you act a little differently and you show\nyou are independent and you do not necessarily fall in\nline in\nmy situation what i encountered was all of a sudden i began to\nreceive some very advanced teachings about life reality humans \u2013\nwhat i call \u201cthe wisdom track and i felt very\nprivileged to be able to get that so\nwhen you have the privilege of having an extraterrestrial encounter\nexperience what i want you to know is that you can often fall into a\ntype of fugue state it is like your soul-mind is coming on and\nbecoming active but you need to keep that intellectual process open and keep your cognitive mind on and question and not just accept\nthings as they come to you and that is going to really make a\ndifference you\nknow think about it it is like when our researchers work with\ngorillas and you have heard of koko the famous signing gorilla if you walk in and you are starting to work with koko and all of\na sudden she does not just say red\nball she says i\nwant carrot cake for dinner you are\ngoing to go whoa i can go to a whole new level with this being\nand you can teach her at a more sophisticated level and\nreally folks that is what it is like sometimes with us is that when you go to a new level they do too okay what i want to do is share with you some of the messages that they\noften bring because now i have now told you to question their\nmessages but what are some of the ones that they can share you\nhear from everybody who has had contact they will talk a lot of\ntimes about environmental concerns sometimes they will have very\npersonal messages for people but\none of the things that happened to me after over five decades of\ncontact is when i was in my 40s i had a very very profound and very\ndifferent visit that changed my life it\nwas one week after what many of you here may know as the phoenix\nlights\nthat happened on march 13 1997 i live in phoenix and i really\ndid not pay any attention to them even though they happened\nover my house but i had a contact visit a week later where they made\nreference to that and they let me know that they had been there but\nwhat they had as i am going to distill it down it was a very\nprofound very long visit but i am going to distill it down to\nthree particular messages knowing that they have entrained me to\nunderstand that the future is nothing more than a probability the\nfuture is mutable they\nhave helped me to understand and this is so important for all of us that the future can be whatever we will\nit and want\nit to be that is why we have to behave so differently and\nbecome empowered they\ntalked about three things they did talk about that there was going\nto be what they called \u201ca triune setting this term is\nthe best that we understood it to be] that at some point in the\nfuture and\ni have got to stop and tell you you know this drives me nuts because the future what next thursday 3012 you know time is\ndifferent to them they never really pin it down but\nat some time in the future that there was going to be what they\nreferred to as a \u201cportal opening that would have great\nsignificance for us now i do not really you know get very involved in the 2012\nphenomenon i am very involved in today and just moving forward but i wonder because there is such a great astrological\nconfiguration happening on that date that everybody\u2019s talking\nabout if that is what they were referring to but\nat some point they said this really does have significance because\nit is an opening in and out of our galaxy and our particular\nplace in the universe that has meaning and it does not happen\nbut very rarely in probably thousands and thousands of years they\nalso made reference to that in our time there was supposed to be the\ndiscovery of records that would reveal a very different history on\nour planet they showed me pictures of what i thought were the\negyptian pyramids and the sphinx and that area and they said that\nwhen these are revealed there will be no refuting the history of the\nextraterrestrial legacy i\ncannot imagine what would be on it because you can refute\nanything and just say that it is myth and story and culture but\nthey said that there was something there i will\ntell you since that happened over ten years ago when that particular\nvisit happened i also now wonder something very differently about\nthis i wonder if actually this may not be egypt but it may\nactually be a part of the ancient atlantean lands that are down by\nbermuda and florida being able to rise up and have some of these\nmonoliths on them it is just a thought that i have had the\nthird thing they said is something that they do not want to have\nhappen and at that time they were very very concerned about a\nnuclear detonation going off in what seemed to be the middle east\nregion so far ten twelve years later we are doing good it\nhas not gone off but\nwhat they said was that it is going to be a very naive situation\nshould the nuclear detonation take place because that there is\na major fault-line and if it does it is going to trigger this\nand therefore it is going to affect the quality of life for\neveryone on your planet and it will not be contained to a\nparticular singular region like you saw when you detonated the bomb\nbefore so\nthese are the nature of some of the messages and some of the things\nthat they can tell you and share with you now i am saying this because are these true i do not know i\nfind them fascinating i find them interesting and i am very\nproud that i have had the privilege to hear them from them but i\nalso know that it does not mean that any of them are necessarily\ngoing to happen that they are potentials for our future that\ncan have greater bearing on us and what comes to fall for us the\nother thing they shared and i know i am going fast but i only\nhave so much time and so i will be available later to go into\ngreater depth of all these things is that they told me about our\npast in a very different way what\nthey did is they said that yes you were a genetically-altered species and i learned about this way before any of this came out into the new\nage culture they said that it is\na little different than you think though they\ntaught me about zecharia sitchin who many of you have heard of before i was even aware of who the man was they told me to go\nexplore his work because they said he is very close to what it\nwas and\nthey said after i explored it that you are\na hybrid race but it is not just that you had this anunnaki\ncoming here who created you they\nsaid what\nit is is you are actually a mixture of twelve genetic strains\nof what we would call extraterrestrial dna and that when the\nlife-form was tinkered with it was not one cultural life-form\noverlaying its presence it was a genetic mixture they\nwent into some very interesting details about it with the science\nthat was used where what i call harmonic\nor sonic\nresonance\nwas used to this may sound like total meta-poop i know because i\nhave scientific background but it is interesting so i am\ngoing to share it they\nsaid that a sonic resonance they used actually sound frequency\nwhen they were doing the genetic tinkering to get the strains to gel\nand to work with each other so\nwhat all this does is it allows us to look at what we know with new\neyes and to think well maybe that definitively could be and hopefully what it will do is will eventually entrain conventional\ntraditional science the renegades who are working within the fringe to start looking along these new lines because\nwe know that it is not a question of darwinism or creationism \u2013\nboth have aspects and flaws within them \u2013 that it is\nsomething else and it is probably not just a third alternative\nbut multiple and when you look at extraterrestrial presence on this\nplanet and the fact that there was probably genetic tinkering it\ncertainly seems to make a lot of sense to me what\nis really intriguing to me is how they went about all of this and\nthe way that they gave me this really new curriculum it was not\nnecessarily sitting down in a lecturing situation it was a lifetime\nof experiences that i had that i could not synthesize and did not\nrealize that they were all coming together to have a focused meaning\nuntil i was in my 30s and i had been going through this since i\nwas in the crib what\nthey did was they actually took me to experience certain things where\ni would actually be taken and i had be witnessing i do not\nknow whether it was a hologram or a point in space-time that was in\nthe past but i had be witnessing and looking at a group of\nworkers who were working under another race i now later realize they\nwere showing me that man actually had been used for some slave\npotential on this planet and had been harnessed for his capacity to\nhelp well help is a generous word is not\nit to help another species so\nthe point is that it is not what you expect it is not like\ngoing to starbucks and it is not like just sitting down and they\nteach you but they can have a very unique process to get you to\nunderstand a new system of reality and a new way of thinking and it\ncan be very very experiential so\nthose are just some of the things that i have been through with them what\ni am most interested now is not really what is going on\nwith me but what is going on with the culture and the way that\nwe are trying to get this out if\nyou look at [shows slide with cowboys daniel boon-types and\nets i love this ad from new mexico the new mexican tourist\nindustry got a lot of flack for this the\nbest place in the universe new mexico earth and if you look closely you see that they have integrated the\nextraterrestrial persona of their state in there which i think is\nvery intriguing and\nif you go along now and you go into the modern culture people as i\nsaid are really accepting more and more of what is out there am\ni am going crazy was this place korean just last week shows\nslide of a cartoon of confused shoppers in a little formerly-korean-run store] you know this is pretty much what we are\nlooking at and what we are facing okay so you know as i mentioned before what for me has been really\nbeneficial about the extraterrestrial contact is that it is\ngiven me new insights into not just human behavior but something\nbigger it is given me insights into where humanity fits within\nother species you know because in some ways we are just those\ncrazy flesh-eating mammals with herd-like tendencies and we tend to\nforget that we tend to put ourselves at the top of the apex so that\nwe are the ultimate supreme species and we are a deity what\ni have learned through how extraterrestrials communicate because they use holographic processes they will often send an image\nto you that has an accompaniment of instant knowing and that this\ngoes on in the animal world too inter-species\ncommunication is somewhat universal and human beings use language and ordered thought processes that does not seem to be communal to\nthe rest of what is out there when\nwe begin to penetrate into the species that are here beside us and\nthe animal kingdom and understand how sophisticated\ntheir thought processes are and how much they know of what goes on that they have their own cultures and relationships with each other and they are not that different from us it allows us to\nintegrate better with the concept of extraterrestrial reality because\ni tell you people are much more likely \u2013 not you but the\naverage person \u2013 is much more comfortable looking at the fuzzy\nlittle animal (on the top that talks [showing slide of a pair of\nhouse cats]  than extraterrestrial reality and since i do both let\nme tell you the ordinary people like the fuzzy little animals a lot\nbetter so\nwhat you will learn and what the power of us and love what\ngandhi had said you know people put it at the end of their internet\nmessages that the\nmoral fiber of a nation is judged by how it treats its animals or something like that that\nreally is at the underpinning of our moving forward is understanding\nthat we are a collaborative species that humans are not cut out\napart the way that we set ourselves to that we have to understand\nthat we are one of a multiple order and that order well it\ngoes off into the space realms has to start right here at home we\nhave to start paying better attention to what goes on  on the\nplanet and how we are treating our animals now i said i had an interesting curriculum one of the very profound\nthings that they started early with was the concept of reincarnation now much of the world if you ask any buddhist they say sure no problem got it its part of our culture the western world still has a problem with this reincarnation is\nsomething that while there is a lot of different type of evidence\nfor it cannot always necessarily be proved empirically but\nwhat they did with me is starting when i was 12 13 14 years old they would come at night and i had be pulled out and i would sit\nthere and i would watch myself in these different existences i would\nwatch and i would see myself as i\nwas a tall thin black man in ancient africa who was swept upon a\nleopard and became part of the food chain i saw myself as a slave in\nancient egypt \u2013 i looked down at my feet and i saw the hard\nground that i slept on and the straw i saw myself as being buried\nalive with a man who was my husband because i was part of his\nproperty all\nthese things where i was dying and had left my body because they\nwere trying to get across the idea that we have an eternal soul and\nthat they needed me to know not to be afraid that no matter what\nhappened in this lifetime that was not it it is a part of the journey and\nwith that i was able to go forward and tackle life with a very\ndifferent perspective than if i had been terrified and afraid oh i am going to die we are all\ngoing to die we just do not know when you know and we are\nborn we have lived we have died time and time again we\njust do not tend to remember it when\nit comes to reincarnation what i think is so important about it is\nthat not only does it remind us of the eternalness of our being but\nit allows us to sometimes look at life with some new eyes and provide\nsome different answers one\nof the things that i was left with is the ability to look at somebody\nand i can immediately see their soul and i can see the trail of the\nreincarnations that they have had now a lot of people say oh we should not get caught up in it we belong in the here and\nnow i agree in that wholeheartedly but sometimes it gives us different\neyes to look at things differently a\nwoman i worked with just a few weeks ago and as i talked to her and\nexplained to her the most prominent series of visions around her was\none in the 1800s in england and how she was involved in the early\nlabor union development and how the smog and the soot just assailed\nher and she could not stand it and she was so frustrated by\nwhat was happening with the businesses and how they were taking\nadvantage of the people at that time at\nthe end she laughed and she said well i am not so sure there is anything to this or not but i\nactually got my masters degree in studying labor law in england and i\nhave a real issue with the pollution and\nyou will see that there are commonalities and carryovers and tie-ins usually the lives that surround you now are often the leftover issues\nthat we are still dealing with that we have pulled together and if you can pull it together with your soul purpose and go forward\nand integrate it into your life as you move forward then you\nwork-life can become your life-work so\nfor me the experience of working with the extraterrestrials and the\nwhole journey of reincarnation had a real profound impact because it\nwas not just about my journey but it was about working with\nother peoples journeys too so yeah we cannot get caught up in it it does not really\nmatter if you were genghis khan or cleopatra who cares but what\nreally matters is what is your personal journey and what do you have\nto do now as you go forward now leading to this and that we are eternal beings the most\nimportant thing i have gotten from these experiences is that\nthere is\nactually\na \u201cscience of the soul and a lot of the things that\nhappen to us are because of this but\nas humans well if we are not even really acknowledging that\nthere really is a soul how are we going to begin to even uncover and\nuncap this science and i have learned some fascinating things\nfrom them now this is where you put your hat on and decide even though i am\nspeaking authoritatively do not let it fool you you\nhave to decide for yourself whether it is true or not from\nwhat i have learned the human being is a unique experience that is\na symbiont experience there is this energetic\nelectric residue if you want to call it that comes in and binds with the biological\nunit and there are two dual-operating systems that coexist \u2013\nwhich i think is interesting if\nyou know anything about the human body you know you have the\nsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems which work together one controls the powerful things like blinking heart beating respirations the other one says i\nthink i am going to move my hand and stroke my hair and i want\nto eat and i am going to do some more complex operations\n\n\napparently\nthere are two systems that learn to coexist in our body and one is\nthe one that is related to the biological unit when\nwe become activated and our soul gets turned on more as a primary\nlistening-point then that operating system comes into greater power it gives you greater discipline and it gives you greater\nunderstanding and greater control to move forward as a more evolved willful human being now there is a whole obviously we do not have time for this you know how the soul binds and how it separates but the one\ninteresting thing that i think is really pertinent that i want to\nmention is that a lot of you have heard about with extraterrestrial\nexperiences  people become paralyzed and they cannot move what\nthey showed me is that many of the races know how to actually\ndisengage the soul from the biological unit what\nthey do as they have explained to me is that they actually can\ncome in and through their abilities they can rotate your nervous\nsystem \u2013 they can disengage it a little bit what they say is\nthey just turn it a little bit so your synaptic junctions do not line\nup and you are not able to control your body and therefore\nthat is where the paralysis comes in again i do not know if this is true i have some medical and\nscientific background but not to that extent but i think it is\nreally interesting and i think it merits further exploration as we\nlook into the new types of sciences that we should be exploring so for those of you who have those paralytic-type\nof encounters oftentimes that is what happens or  you come\nback from a lucid dream and you slam back into your body and you\ncannot really move for a while the alignment has not taken\nplace the\nreason i am sharing these types of things is that i want you to\njust look at life differently and say that there is many\ndifferent explanations for all these crazy things that can happen out\nthere some of them might make sense and might actually be proven if\nwe move in the right direction in science so\nthere is this whole science of the soul that provides a lot of\nexplanation for what happens and why it happens that we have yet to\nuncover and once we do things are going to make a lot more common\nsense the\nother thing is learning about that space and time and dimensions\ndo not coincide with our traditional understanding i mean why the human has an orientation and why we just do not get it is\nbecause we think linear we think up we think down we think left right east/west north/south and because of that we have to learn to think more inside\nand outside\nand move in a different direction i am\ngoing to go really fast now because i just got the warning sign all\nright i want to talk to you real quickly and let you know that with\ntime-space and reality that there is something called a nodal\npoint\nand when you hear about people talking about attraction\nand things coming to you part of it is tied into this what\nwe are able to do is we are able to get ourselves to this\ncrux of time-space energy where everything can flow out and you can\ndo this through your consciousness what happens is when you get\nyourself to the power of this nodal point and you start thinking in a\nconscious direction you can redirect the flow of the futures that\ncome to you all\nright so why are things happening now because my friends we have\nthese new eyes and capacity to reinterpret the world life used to be\nlike that life is now like this refers to slide that shows the\nfamous \u201camerican gothic painting by grant wood in 1930 next to the classic painting is a re-creation of the painting but\nwith the farmer and wife talking on cell phones and the farmer has a\ngolf club instead of the pitchfork] because we have technology technology has given us the insider course to the answers for many of\nthe things that were not able to be understood before and so our\nancient alchemists are really today\u2019s modern scientists so\nwhat i have done for that first part is i have given you a\npreview of what it is been like and some of the things that i have\nlearned obviously i cannot dump 50-plus years into the course\nof 45-minutes-to-an-hour but i wanted to give you a little bit of\ninsight into what it is been like for me but\nnow i am more interested in something far more important it is\nnot about me it is about you and this is what i want to\nspend the last 15 minutes talking to you about you\nall have come here and you have all talked to yourself about you\nknow we have got this mission we are awakening  we\nfeel special you\nhave a new job assignment and it is not that you are this\ngreat prophet or anything you are really door-holders you are\nin concierge services if\nyou want people to think differently and be open to your ideas you\nneed to just gently introduce them to it in a way that is\npalatable to them and that is what your responsibility is besides your own journey of awakening you are also here for\nother people this\n is how humans\ntend to see the world they tend to see it in their suburban\nbackground in their isolated houses in their little communities and then their cities and they stay within their viewpoints you\nnever even get them to look up into the sky hardly at all to see\nwhat is going  there so we see ourselves as this contained\nglobe but how you\nsee the world is different because you see it with the power of\nmetamorphosis and the power of change and of infinite possibility and\nyou know that what is been fed to us is not necessarily\nwhat is real so\nyour new job description is metamorphosis and that you are\nchange-agents of a new degree because you are dealing with\nextraterrestrial reality and human higher consciousness and you have\nto do it in a way that you do not appear disenfranchised you do not\nappear alienated from them that they are able to listen to you\nand they want to listen to you i\nmean i have had this crazy background and extremely far-out and\ni have been very very successful walking into many different\ncountries many different corporations many different businesses many different people and have been able to give people some very\nstrong tools for progressing forward it is\nall about the way that we communicate and the way that we do it so i\nneed you to understand something about your audience because i want\nyou to have some tangible tools as you move forward this\nis who you are working with on the planet now shows slide with\nthe \u201cel\u2019s oh\u2019s and em\u2019s ] i tend to call it\n\u201calphabet demographics el\u2019s oh\u2019s and em\u2019s\n\n\nokay the el\u2019s are what you had consider yourself enlightened\nluminaries you know you have seen it all extraterrestrial paranormal\nexperiences you are in tune with those who connect with you in\nthe unseen world on the other side nothing fazes you and you are\nwell aware on the pathway the\noh\u2019s are what i call the ordinary\nhumans these are the people who are still out there they may be interested\nin what oprah has to say they think all this is kind of interesting and\nin that group is the emerging\nhuman the \nand\nthose emerging humans those are the people who are \u201cretarded in terms of making headway with them that they would be willing to\nhear you if you communicate appropriately with them this is what kerry\nonce interviewed me and i called them \u201cthe swing vote these are the people who are looking to know more about what is\nout there are fed up with what they have been told because it no\nlonger fits the world as they see it but they need to have it\npackaged in a way that they can accept and is understandable to them this\nis where it is incumbent upon us to stop thinking about ourselves oh i do this and i read this book and i have this and have you heard\nabout this and to sit down shut up and listen to them and to start\nunderstanding where they come from acknowledging who they are it is\nnot about you it is about you extending your hand and saying i\nhear you you know i have some things to offer instead of overpowering them with what we have encountered on our\njourneys and what we know because they have some extraordinary things\nto share these are the people who are going to determine our future we of course do have the em\u2019s the\nelementary man who is what i call the\nfunda-mental which i think is an appropriate word for them these are the people\nwho are greatly filled with intolerance because they do not want\nyou challenging their paradigm if you come forward with your ideas and what you know and the things we are talking about here this\nweekend you have just violated their world and their sanctity that is something that they just will not tolerate and will create\na very difficult life for you i\ngot this on the internet i\ndo not know who to attribute it to it is one of the most\nbrilliant things i have ever seen \u2013 the\nworld according to americans america we are number one we are number one eastern and western\neurope is you know pussies\nand communists coffee comes from south america we only know australia\u2019s\nkangaroos you know the polar cap\u2019s\ncold santa this\nis really how most of america sees things and i had love to give\ncredit to whoever it came from but it came through anonymously evil-doers (even though there\u2019re bombs going here you know mexico and south america they do our\nlaundry and lawns you know this is what we are\ndealing with and you have got to remember and you have got\nto respect \u2013 this is their world too okay so your tools are remember  it is all about perspectives and while this looks like a nice little design shows slide of an\nelephant skin] this is actually elephant skin and so your tools are\nto show people that it is not what it seems there is\nsomething deeper underneath it and\nso your approach is the \u201cnew 3-rs which is not reading riting and \u2018rithmetic this is something i work with\npeople in great depth with and this is important you\nhave to make yourself relevant you\nknow if you are just sitting there on your commune and you are\njust working with your own little sphere it is not going to\nwork you have to come into today\u2019s world if you really want to\nbe a change-maker you have to do things within today\u2019s 21st\ncentury and make yourself relevant to today\u2019s culture and\nsociety you have\ngot to be realistic you have\ngot to look at what you are working with for the second \u201cr you have got to not just say well you know the aliens are going to be here on sunday or i am channeling them and you want to come hear them you have got to be realistic with who you are working with\nand what you are dealing with and you need to speak to them in\nthose appropriate terms but\nmost importantly my friends you have got to be relatable you\nhave got to be able to be somebody that they are willing to look\nat and to listen to and to not be necessarily bringing your stuff\non them but you are entering into their world two\nthousand years ago you had a great teacher here and a lot of the\nteachings that were really relevant\nwere lost one\nof the things i will share with you which you can dismiss or accept is that there was a group that he worked with and in this group he\ntaught them the ways of the common ordinary man he taught them about\ntheir behaviors and he taught them how to go forward not just in\nthis lifetime but in their future lifetimes as effective messengers messengers who will open the door messengers of change and in\ndoing that you have to be relatable as you read your old-time\nreadings you will read about the ancient essenes how they would\nchange their robes when they went into town so they matched what the\npeople were wearing so\nthese three \u201crs are things i want you to remember and\nso you know the change that is happening as i heard you all\ntalking about it before it is true enough\nwith all the spiritual mumbo-jumbo pal what i am seeking is\nreal interchange said the piggybank to the guru showing a cartoon of a coin piggy\nbank sitting in front of a guru]\n\n\nthe\nchange is us when we\nchange everything\nchanges it starts within us each and every one of us and it has a\ngreat cascading effect now i have got to say this before i finish up the other part of\nmetamorphosis is financial and that you have to realize that we are\nno longer these spiritual monks walking along with an alms bowl\nsaying i will\nteach you for a dinner we\nhave a lot of hang-ups about money and finances and you know it is\nparticularly apt now because of the state of the world what we have\nto realize is that this is how we flex our collective arm on this\nplanet through financial maneuverings and money it is\nnot money\nthat is bad it is getting hung up on money it is the\nkey of loving money of wanting you know amassing millions and\nbillions and living for a 401k instead of quality of life so you have\ngot to get over this poverty consciousness of i am\nspiritual i am good i am poor what\nis important for us is to be independent functioning members of\nsociety moving society forward so it is the love of money not\ngetting caught up in it that is a critical tool for us to become\nfinancially aware and not have a hang-up if somebody wants to pay you\nfor your services and that you have a right to earn a living okay so it is sound spiritual economics and\nwhat i want to show you is that it is no longer where we just\nused to be the wizard in the woods is what we were looking for for\nthis magic change is that this\n is the\neveryday change-agent now you may not like it but a lot of you are\nactually still back in the traditional avenues making headway and\nmaking change not\neverybody comes to these types of things who are making a difference\non the planet and there have been a lot of people who are out there\ndeveloping new businesses new technologies and doing the really hard\ngrunt work that is going to carry us all forward sometimes\nthey still look like they used to but you know that with people in\nchange [loses cable connection to slides \u2013 deleted as not\nrelevant] sometimes they look like this so sometimes that\nbusinessman is really somebody very profound who is back once\nagain and\nso what i am choosing to do with all the knowledge that i have\nhad rather than sitting down writing books and doing this type of\nthing is i am looking at people and i am giving them very\nnew tools to change i am\nhelping them on their incarnational trek to become aware of who they\nwere but how it has relevance to today looking at their soul lessons\nand then repositioning them in a business-type and\nentrepreneurial-type of venture around the world planting those\nhuman seeds of change and giving them the practical vision and skills\nthat they need to be able to function in the world as it now exists it may not be the one that you like it may not be the one that you\nwant it is the one that we have and\nso they are doing some very amazing things you know and i love\nthis quote success\nin almost any field depends more on energy and drive than it does on\nintelligence because this explains why we have so many stupid\nleaders we are\ntrying to get rid of the stupid leaders and we are trying to put\nin the people who can make a difference and understand the synthesis\nof what is going on on the planet and that we need to move forward what\nwe are seeing mostly around the world are lifestyle communities\nbeing built up different ways of bringing up and educating the\nchildren food production changes and a total reeducation such as\nyou are doing here with project camelot now as i get ready to leave you i want you to know one thing and this is\nwhat has been made very clear to me by those who visit us and those\nwho teach is that we are here together we have a group\nincarnational lesson and if we do not pull this off things most\nlikely are not going to be as optimal for us as they could be what\nthat group incarnational lesson is stop saying you\nread urantia you read jane roberts you know i do not believe in this we\nhave to look at each other and see the soul-lights within each other\nand see who we are as a collective group we have to truly as\nclich\u00e9d as it sounds see the love in each other or it is\ngoing to stop being kind of pissy with each other and deciding i\ndo not like this i am judging this we do not have time for that anymore there\nis a very short timeframe environmentally it looks like does not\nit for us to make some things differently and\nso it is all about seeing the soul-light and networking with\neach other in a way that you never have before making each other\nsmarter and sometimes that networking involves a little bit of a\ndifferent partner does not it you\nreally are your brother\u2019s keeper this is what they told me that old biblical clich\u00e9 in this time in this frame it\nhas never been truer you have to take care of yourself but now\nyou are just as responsible for the other person not well it is just my stuff and my path yes i said it is up to each of us to change to make the change now\nwe have to form the chain-link now we have to come out and work\ntogether and do it in a way that is very smart the\nreal secret behind all this  if you want to make a difference  is\npeople who do great things do not take no\nfor an answer they just go ahead and they forge and they find the\nresources and know what needs to be done they\nalso understand the power of kindness and you will learn that\nit is far better to be kind than to be right being kind in\nbusiness and being kind as you go forward in your ventures has\ngreater weight than anything else you will ever do and\nmost importantly we have to realize it is not an\nextraterrestrial that is going to save us it is not an\nangel people who do great things know that man alone has the power\nto work out his destiny in combination with his own intelligence \u2013\nthat hybrid approach again of the spirit the soul and the\ncognitive reasoning so\nwhen we talk about thinking outside the box we are now taking\nit to a new level in terms of what the box is you know you folks\nalready are thinking way outside the box so\nwhen i look at metamorphosis remember  behind the change on\nthis planet is a change in perspective your ability to see things\ndifferently along with other peoples capacity to now listen\nto the things you have to say is rooted \u2013 a lot \u2013 in\nscience technology and advances bringing us to a new world so\ni love to end with this saying brave\nmen earn the right to shape their own destiny\nby arthur schlesinger and i like to put my own little twist on it to all my little sisters out there brave\nwomen earn the right to shape their own destiny so i know that i left out a lot because we had some difference in the\ntime changes i know i went fast in some areas but what i am\ngoing to say to you is i want to thank you so much for giving me the\nchance to bring you a little view of what i am doing out there\nin the world to try to make a difference as\ni say i am going to be here if you want to talk to me and get\nsome more detail on the things that i just quickly glossed over so\nthank you for allowing me the time to be here thank you marcia bill\nryan (br marcia i think i am going to employ you as a\nconsultant to help me improve the quality of my visual presentations that was so beautiful i love those pictures thank you thank you that was wonderful thank you kerry\ncassidy (kc here\nis\nmiriam\ndelicado an incredible friend we consider her a part of camelot believe it or not because she is such a supporter and because we\ntend to work together with her as we do  several of our\nwitnesses it is\nan amazing dynamic \u2013 there is such teamwork happening that would also include david wilcock and george green and actually almost everyone who is speaking at the conference has become someone\nthat we are sort of working with someone we go to to ask advice on\ndifferent matters someone who has their own sort of agenda that\nwe are trying to support as well in\nmiriam\u2019s case she is working with indigenous people as\nyou may know to bring peace to the planet to also make people aware\nof various things i am not going to speak for her here i am\ngoing to let her do that but i want to say that she is an amazing personality as well as a\nspiritual being and i honor her as my colleague and friend a dear dear woman to me and i am just very grateful that she is\nalive today\n\u2013 there\nhave been efforts to take her out i\nrecently did an interview with her it is quite short it is\nabout\na half hour during that interview the tape and the film \u2013 i\nwas not touching the camera i just focused on her and stepped\naway \u2013 it was hit by some kind of scalar weaponry over and\nover and over again it is\nan amazing thing that certain numbers of our witnesses the powers\nthat be  whether they are et or whether they are using scalar\nweaponry and they are human  do not want you to hear what\nthey have to say and she is one of those people so pay close attention because she says things that may seem very sort\nof every-day and yet she has a certain way of speaking it is an\ninteresting phenomenon and suddenly what seem like plain words will\ntake on new import so i want to welcome miriam delicado i\nwant to make sure this wire talk to the crowd i just want to make\nsure they can hear you miriam\ndelicado (md thank you whoo i think they heard the \u201cwhoo when i sat down maybe can everybody hear me all right audience\ncomments] no audien\n yeah go ahead okay well if i start talking maybe you can hear me a little\nbit thank you i feel like a bit of a diva i\njust want to say that i am extremely nervous i am shaking it is going to take me a few minutes to get through just a\ncouple of words that i wanted to say that are going to make me cry so i can get them done and out of the way first\nof all i want to talk about kerry and bill and i want everyone to\nreally just look around the room and see what extraordinary people\nyou are sitting next to from all around the world conferences\nare everywhere but something that i have noticed that is\nreally special about camelot and the people that go to camelot is\nthat you have a deep desire to take action that you are not\njust filling your minds with this information but that you are\nasking the question what\ncan i do for myself for my community this\nwhole concept of project camelot is really i believe making an\nimpact on the world because i most certainly receive emails from\naround the world from some extraordinarily small places in china villages in japan indigenous people from remote areas so the voices that we have at camelot are very strong and i just want to\nhonor kerry and bill for allowing not just me but all of us to have\nthis opportunity to learn and to grow and walk through this process\ntogether so i just want to say thank you the\nsecond thing i want to share on a really personal note is to talk to\nyou about my car accident something very significant happened in the\nweek prior and the days prior to that car accident and to me it was\nnot a (quote accident it was not in\nsaying that i had this happen and it was very shocking to me because it came out of absolutely nowhere i had no precognition that\nanything was going to happen and so when kerry and bill found out \nthey called me from europe  they then got on the phone almost\nimmediately and called people in los angeles to come to my side voice\ntearful] i could not walk i could not walk i could not\nget out of bed i could not do anything and i know so many of\nyou are asking me about this and it is been very difficult for\nme but i wanted to tell you something really remarkable that came\nout of that because i was really concerned for myself after the\naccident kerry\nand bill swooped in they sent people to my side and they put me on\ntheir radio program and immediately people were sending me healing\nenergy which i was asking for they were sending me strength and\nthey were sending me protection so i feel just overwhelmed with gratitude  to all of\nyou\nbecause by the time two days rolled around after that \u2013 after\neveryone started sending all these emails and messages to me and\nhealing and the healers walked in i got up and i walked i\ngot up out of bed and i walked out of that room that i was in where i\nhad stayed in bed for five days \u2013 i could not get up i had\nslept the entire time it was like i was in a total daze in another\nworld i barely remember it so you healed me i still have a few problems but that whole situation\nrolls me into why i am here and what i want to talk to you about\n\u2013 and that is the power that we have in coming together which\nis the blessing that i always have in my life of how i get to\nobserve what happens when people make a decision to come together so i just wanted to say thank you to all of you and tell you that from\nthis point forward i am doing well and i thank you for all of\nyour support now when we talk outside of this room let us\nreally get to some business because now you all know i am doing\nwell i am\nhoping that most of you have watched the project camelot interviews\nthat i have done and you are aware that i have had extraordinary\net contacts for most of my life and that i still have those contacts\nup until the present day so i am going to share some things\nwith you that i have not shared publicly up to this point i\nonly have an hour i never write down a speech or know what it is\nexactly that i am going to talk about before i walk into a room so hopefully i will stay on track twenty-one\nyears ago when i was taken onboard a craft in the physical body i\nwas physically taken and walked onboard a ufo this really amazing\nknowledge was imparted to me about how we are all connected and you\nknow these are simple words we\nare all one if\nyou were to sit down and meditate for the rest of your life on that\none sentence \u2013\nwe are all one\n\u2013 you would still never fully understand the concept that we\nare all one people\nwrite books and they make it complicated and they say we are all\none and we are all connected and all of these things and they\nmake it complicated but it is not it is very simple we\nare one\npeople and that does not mean people in the united states it\ndoes not mean people in canada from where i am from it\nmeans people all around the world we are one people and we need to\ntake responsibility for ourselves in our actions for what it is that\nwe are doing to walk into this future that we are heading towards now this is actually one of the main messages that i received from these\ntall blond ets in 1988 is that there would come a time when humanity\nwould be walking into a \u201ctime of choice you are\nchoosing right now what future it is that you want we\ncannot change the world in one day we cannot change our financial\nsystem in one swoop we cannot even break it down we cannot\ndestroy it because it is what we have so what can\nwe do i\ndid not listen to all of george green\u2019s presentation i\nknow that he talks about the financial situation quite a bit and he is\nvery knowledgeable he is an amazing instrument to be able to\ncome forward and give you this knowledge of the steps that we are\ntaking in order to change the system every\ntime an individual makes the decision and makes the choice and acts\non it and becomes responsible to change their financial situation to\nchange the way that we are living daily life in a monetary\nsystem the way that we are living life and with our food\nproduction all\nof these issues \u2013 and there are many \u2013 when they all come\ntogether in all of those little bits and pieces it becomes\nthe change that we need to have now going back to the ets they said that we would come into this time of\nchoice and that was the first part one\nof the second things that they said is that during this time of\nchoice a lot of people would become crazy and let me tell you if\nyou know people around you they are losing their minds i am\ngoing to tell you why they are losing their minds and it is\ngoing to get a little bit technical when\ni take responsibility for myself i basically raise the vibrational\nlevel of my physical body and my spiritual body combined  those\ntwo things when\ni walk out into the world and i am walking around here at the\nconference and you maybe walk up to me and you feel something that is\nthat energy that i am letting flow through me and you do it as\nwell every single person does it flows through us and it is\nlike walking along and letting droplets fall beside you it is\ndrops of my energy that are melting into yours and with that energy\ncomes information so\nevery single person here is\nbeing responsible and\nmaking a difference just by sitting in this room and listening to\nthese speakers because every time you are with other people you are\nsharing your knowledge here so\ndo not panic and think that you need to tell everyone everything\nall the time \u2013 because i get this from a lot of people i\nwant to tell everybody it is not necessary you show them who you are through your\nactions through your emotions through your physical body through\nyour spiritual self that is how you make a change the\nreason that people are going crazy is because if you have a person\nwho is not willing\nto make this change along with us who wants to stay in a really\nmaterialistic world and wants nothing but five cars and the\nsuper-mansion and so forth well they are not going to be\naccepting this energy very well and it is going to drive them a\nbit mental so\nwhat we need to do is we need to have patience with the people around\nus this was a really big point that these ets made with me is that\nduring this particular time that we are going through and\nthis is going to be over the course of several years by the way this is not going to be ending next year it is not going to be\nending in 2012 it is going to be over the course of the next\n10 15 20 years so buckle down because this is just the beginning you\nare the people who are going to lead the others into this new world\nthat we are walking into so we need to take care of ourselves\nspiritually we need to take care of ourselves mentally but with the\nknowledge it sounds really simple does not it but it makes a\nhuge impact i\nknow in my own personal life which is the only thing that i can talk\nabout is even if i walk into a room people know\nthat i am different i do not have to say a single word and\neventually when they find out that i have had these contacts and\nprior to me being forthright with people about my contacts with my\npsychic abilities that i have which are extensive they would say oh i knew\nthere was something really\nweird about you and they had go on and on and they had say man now it all makes sense this\nis a very important point that the ets need people to understand \u2013\nthat it is a personal responsibility of the soul\nthat we need to first and foremost address in order for us to make an\nimpact twenty-one\nyears ago i am onboard this craft they tell me they said one\nday there are people  a particular group of people  that i will\nfind and that when i do i will know what to do and\ni did find those people and they are very special people i\ndo not talk about them very much but they are the hopi i know\nthat the hopi are only one of these very special people on the\nplanet one group of them within the indigenous community these\nindividuals their physical bodies may have been born here and have\ncome from here but their actual dna and structure and form\nof the human body came from what i call \u201cthe last world if you would like to call it atlantis or if you would like to call it lemuria\nor so forth you go ahead i am not going to get into it\nbecause you know what quite frankly it is not important what\nis important is that these people these indigenous people from\naround the world when they originally came to this world were the first people on this earth and that they were allowed\nto come here because\nthey were given an opportunity to come they\nwere asked do\nyou want to come and be taken off the planet while we cleanse it of\nthese negative forces that have taken over they came and they are the stewards of this land this earth they are the caretakers the original caretakers if\npeople understood how much struggle these people have around the\nworld to maintain what it is that they have yes they live in\npoverty and i am not talking about hopi  i am talking\nabout everywhere they live in poverty they have struggled through\nrepression they do not have proper schooling they have a lot\nof problems with the same issues that we have in the rest of the\nworld with alcohol and drugs and so forth but\nmake no mistake that even through all of that if you meet an\nalcoholic that is an indigenous person you still know\nthat they are special if you sit and listen to them and what is\nthat it is their dna that has come from \u201cthe last world that is\none of the things that these ets talked to me about quite detailed that during this time of choice and during this time of change that\nthese people held a key to our future in\nthe history of the indigenous people they have been crushed by\noutsiders \u2013 not just whites \u2013 the outside world those\nthat have come afterwards which is the rest of the population they\nhave their own land they are protecting the water they are\nprotecting the earth they have certain abilities to work within the\nsystem of the financial system in order to create the new systems if\nthey have sovereignty they have the ability to change the monetary\nsystems and create their own banks if\nthey have their own land they have the ability to create\neco-villages that are going to be the platforms for a new future if\nthey have massive amounts of land then they can begin to build new\nways of farming and producing food that is more productive than\nhaving it the way that we have it right now which is killing our\nsoil they\nalso have knowledge about herbs and medicines and healing practices\nthat we can benefit from but\nlet us be clear on something which is really important what i am\ntalking to you about sounds as though it came from me reading a book or looking at something over here or having a conversation over\nthere but what i am actually talking to you about came directly\nfrom extraterrestrials so\ni take note of that and i say all\nright what can i do in order to assist them so\nif you want to make a huge impact and you want to make it quickly one of the ways that this community can do that is to find the tribe\nin your area and ask them what\ncan i do to work with you you are\nnot going to be there to help them we do not help\neach other we assist\none another a lot of people try and help and they use their egos and they use another part of themselves and\nthat does not work but if you work with\nsomeone then you leave the ego out of it and you actually accomplish\nsomething now twenty-one years ago they said there would be a time and i call it\nthe\ngreat gathering the great gathering of humanity comment\nabout how much time she has left has been deleted i am\ngoing to share something extraordinary with you it is the first\ntime i have shared this publicly and i think it is time twenty-one\nyears ago and i know i keep repeating myself because i am\nactually a little tired i had a rough day yesterday so i apologize when they talked about this great gathering they said that one of\nthe keys to this the biggest key was the indigenous communities\naround the world coming together first and foremost secondly it was the star family the star beings that are here in body like\nmyself and i am sure like a lot of you out there sitting in the\naudience because we are the ones doing the work we are\nthe ones making the changes we are the ones that are not\nworking from the ego \u2013 there is no place for it here we are\nin absolute service giving up our family lives to a certain degree giving up our homes our cars our financial stability giving up our\nfriendships that we have had for years in order to work in\nabsolute service for humanity and for the earth so\nthe indigenous cultures come together the star beings and the star\nfamily come together and beyond that how do we pull everyone else\nin \u2013 the mothers the children the grandchildren the\ngrandfathers everyone the politicians and i am really sorry\nto tell you this but the religious leaders from around the world as\nwell i am\nnot interested in talking to someone about how \u201cthis religion is no good and \u201cthat religion is no good and\n\u201cthis belief is no good and \u201cthat one you\nknow what every single person on this planet is a human\nbeing and so if we want to make a change we need to invite everyone\ninto the circle i\nhad a conversation with someone here last night who was a little\noff-center and they said that they felt as though there were a number\nof \u201calphabet people ed note cia fbi nsa etc in the room and you know what if there is\nanyone here along those lines that is from some sort of an\norganization that does not like what we are doing you know\nwhat i said to this person i\nsaid invite\nthem to sit down with you invite them to your table and have a\nconversation with them and teach them something because that is\nwhat this is about because\nwhen that person walks away guess what they are still in this\nbody so regardless of what they are being told to do or\ndirected to do they are still going to be able to hear your\nvoice so\nthis great gathering is something that i have been waiting a very\nlong time in order to begin working on because that is exactly\nwhat i was instructed to do was to talk to people and let them know\nthat this great gathering will take place around the world it\nwill not have a charge so if you hear\nabout a gathering of indigenous people if you hear about a gathering\nof other people and there is a big charge for the amount of\nmoney that you need to go  this is not the prophesied gathering this is not the great gathering because that is not\nfor sale \u2013 for any charge for\nsuch a long time people asked me the details of what it is that will\nhappen i tell them that i have held this vision in my mind for all\nthese years of every man woman and child on earth knowing that this\nevent was taking place all at the same time or maybe all in the same\nweek where gatherings around the world would happen in the middle of\na city in the middle of a village or a small town the people would\njust gather and\nthe gathering does not have to say anything they just have to\ngather and be peaceful and say we\nwant a change in this world you\nknow 9/11 was a horrible thing and again at this point in my\npersonal world i do not care who created it what i care about\nand i think about often is the power the power of humanity because the moment that i saw that tower come\ndown do you know what i did well i am sure some of you\nknow what i did \u2013 i cried i guess i cry a lot but i cried emotionally\ni was so distraught and so disturbed because i knew that this would\naffect every single human being on earth i cried because i felt my\ngod they are going to go to war this is it nuclear war is on\nits way my god i\nprayed and prayed and prayed then\ngatherings started happening around the world and it was like a\nvigil and i believe i felt a change happen because my first absolute\nintuition was absolute war world-wide war then as soon as the\ngatherings started happening around the planet i thought thank\ngod because it means that these politicians are going to get the\nmessage that nobody wants this big war that it is not going to\nbe accepted and it is not and it was not so\nwe minimized the impact on ourselves by creating those gatherings\naround the world and i know\nthis \u2013 for myself i know this about\na year-and-a-half ago in january of 2008 i\nwas instructed i had a telepathic communication with my ets to meditate which i\nfinally did after about three days i finally had the time to sit\ndown and i meditated they came to me and they were very very very\nclear they\nsaid they wanted me to do something specific and i apologize for\nbeing cryptic but i am often cryptic for reasons they\nactually asked me to make something and i said okay what i am\nin this mediation and they said we\nwant you to look at something over here and then we want you to make\nit i\nsaid okay the\ntall blond was standing right in front of me and i was sort of in\nthis astral world not really paying attention going okay i am here what do you want i had to get back out because my mother needed me and\nthey said no pay attention and\nit was like i blinked and then the tall blond was standing on my\nright and this object was sitting in front of me they\nsaid make\nthis object and they gave me some instructions with it they\nsaid that it was time for the great gathering to begin that the\nfoundations of it need to be started so\ni said all\nright they\nsaid when\nyou return you must write this down immediately and\ni said okay so\ni came out of the meditation i sketched it out and i put it away that was in january in\nmarch i took a trip i was going to nevada i\nsaid do\ni need to bring it with me they said no\n\u2013 very clearly \u2013 no i\nsaid okey\ndokey around\njuly they said to me that they wanted me to get on the road and make\nthis piece that they wanted me to make and start laying the\nfoundation for the great gathering i\nsaid okay i\nwas looking after my mother at the time who was aged and she was in\nthe dying process and i said to them no\nway i am not doing it i am not leaving her i\nsaid you\nhave to give me exactly what i ask for or forget it so\ni laid out my demand list i said 1 my mother must be taken care of she must go into a place where she\nis loved and she is taken care of to the highest good first 2 you must supply me with the money because i had no money 3 you must find someone to make this piece for me because i cannot do\nit on my own and\nthe fourth thing and i want you to listen very carefully to this\nbecause it is going to teach you something about the creation\nthat we\nhave the ability to do 4 you\nmust bring eagle feathers to\nmy feet i demand a physical proof that what you are asking me to do is true\nand correct or i will not do this i must have this come to me\nphysically or i will not believe that this is real so i demand\neagle feathers to my feet and i demand one white pure white feather this\npiece is carved a week later (i will not get into all the\ndetails a carver i ended up at his house  no idea that he is\na carver  went to his house for some strange reason walked in the\ndoor after an hour of conversation he said i\ndo not know why you are here i\nsaid well i certainly do he\nsaid can\nyou tell me why i showed him the piece and he began working on it immediately two\ndays later a stranger paypal\u2019d $800 to me then they paypal\u2019d\nanother $800 to me i had $1600 in my paypal in a week someone\ncalled and said we have\ngot a bed for your mother she has to come immediately i\ncalled an ambulance and took her to the hospital where she was\nabsolutely loved and taken care of extraordinarily well and\nthe last thing is i walked out of my house to go and water my\ngarden and i want to stand up for this i had to go and water the\ngarden so i pulled the hose and i pulled it because i had to water\nsomething in the far corner i pulled it and it was you know acts\nout pulling hard] jarring on the hose and\nthen i stood there and i had my feet like i was just looking at the garden and then i looked right here [points\nto spot right in front of her feet] literally right there seven\neagle feathers seven eagle feathers can you imagine what went\nthrough my mind at that point again but not only that not only\nthat there was one\npure absolutely\npure white feather sitting in the middle of it i had\ntold them i\ndo not care how you bring these eagle feathers to me you can\nbring someone to my door and knock on the door and say here\u2019s\nyour eagle feathers you can leave them at my doorstep i\nsaid none of this\nget-in-the-car-drive-five-minutes-get-out-walk-into-the-bush i\nsaid i\ncannot do that because at that point i could not leave my mother for more than\n20 minutes at a time so\ni said you\nmust bring them to my feet have one of them fly over and drop them\nin my yard i do not care so\nthe point is that these ets are still with me and they are very very\nstrong but\nwhere did this go comment about getting up and walking around\ndeleted]\nhere\u2019s\nwhat happened i took the piece i went to arizona the message was the\ngathering the great gathering must begin and i am shaking i am vibrating all over as i am\nsaying this to you through\nthis strange set of circumstances which i do not have time to\nget into i ended up talking to someone who said that these people\nfrom south america  the mayans  to be exact were calling on this\ngathering because they themselves had been receiving messages that\nit was time for the great gathering to take place it\nwas an absolute chance that i ended up having this meeting with these\ntwo individuals and the events leading up to it were extraordinary so\nthe point is that as i am getting i am staying in my own\nremote little world i do not read books i do not talk to\npeople a lot about the messages that they are getting i do not\ngo to lectures that type of thing to try and keep myself as clear\nas possible so when i do get a message it is powerful they\nsaid to me that it was time for this gathering to take place the\nets are making contact with people around the world and giving them\nthese messages they are saying it is time that these\npossible cataclysms these possible earthquakes volcanoes you name\nit solar flares may come but\ni really want to stress something to you we have the ability as a\nhuman\nbeing\nto stop all of that we have the ability to create with our minds\nwhat we want see you can focus on your financial situation you can focus on your home\n you can focus on the fact that you are not sure where your\njob\u2019s going to come to \u2013 but please do me a favor and\nfocus on what it is that you want\nin the world it is\nnot going to be about money it is not going to be about power it is going to be about the human being again so you need to\nfocus in on the heart and know that we are moving back into that\ntime i am\nso grateful that people like george green are taking charge of things\nthat i have no ability to be able to talk on and that is the\ngreat thing also is that each person that is coming forward right\nnow to speak has a piece of this puzzle so\nthe great gathering is in the stages of beginning now i am going to say some things that\u2019ll probably tick off\nsome people and i am apologizing to them because if they watch\nthis film they are not in this room but if they watch this\nfilm they will not be very pleased with me the\nmayans have begun to come forward and i am sure that many of you\nare hearing about this now i have contacts in the indigenous world who are not the mayans \u2013\nother people in the indigenous world i am not just talking\nabout one tribe i am talking about several of them they\ndo not agree with what it is that these mayans are saying they are\nnot agreeing with it they do not believe that saying that the end of\nthe world is coming is the right approach because it is not the\nmayans are the timekeepers well great \u2013 they are the\ntimekeepers do they have so much ego that they cannot believe\nthat the other tribes need to be involved in what it is that they are\ndoing this\nis not about the mayans it is not about the hopi it is\nnot about the lakota it is not about anyone what this is about\nis all of them coming together and coming together in unity to be\nable to have this gathering so that we can create this flow of\nchange so when you are listening to things that are coming out right now\ntoday \u2013 right now \u2013 from the\nmayans and from others who are talking about that i want you to hear\nmy words because if they want to speak and if this person these individuals choose\nto speak allow them to do so but understand that they are not\nspeaking for anyone other than themselves and they are not in the\nconsensus of all of them for their information and\ni thought for a very long time about this about whether or not i\nshould say something or not but so many people have contacted me\nwith fear about what these mayans are saying and this has never been\nthe intention so\nthey may have this contact with these beings they may have a contact\nthrough spirit because they did get the message that it was time for\nthe gathering but\nin my own personal view \u2013 not in the et view but in my\npersonal view \u2013 there\u2019re other issues getting in the way\nof them being able to be as productive as they should be or could be to be as positive and create the change that we need to have so\nmy et contacts are still very strong and i am blessed by them i\ndo not see them every day i do not talk to them all the\ntime i follow the instructions that they give me and i try to share\nmy insights my knowledge my spiritual self in order to bring some\nsort of understanding to other people there is\na vast amount of areas that i can talk about you want to talk about\nthe science i can talk about the science you\nwant to talk about the her comment about she needs to stop walking around for the cameraman\ndeleted] i can talk about the way that the crafts are run and some of\nthat technology but what does it do for you tell me all of these\ndifferent technologies are out there zero-point energy this kind of\nenergy there is so much talk about that you\nnow what there is not a single area in your life that does not\nabsolutely reflect right back to these ets food\nproduction \u2013 the way that we are planting our food \u2013\nand what is happening with it right now may have come from\nsomewhere that is not a positive source through genetic manipulation\nof seeds get\nyour seeds your heritage and heirloom seeds so that we can continue\nto grow our own food that process is being shut down all around the\nworld and we need to be very very careful of what it is that we are\ndoing with our own food production because our waters are being taken\naway our food is being taken away our rights i am\nin the united states right now and i have great respect for every\nsingle human being on earth so i do not talk about a particular\ncountry i talk about humanity and i talk about people every single\nman woman and child on this planet has a right\nto have a life a life that has food water shelter and guess what\nelse joy and happiness and love what\nis wrong with us i\nrecently took a trip to africa and i do not know how many of\nyou have seen that movie district\nnine i went to see that because i like to see what is being put out\ninto the world regarding this subject matter i was horrified to see\nthat the living conditions that these ets were living in have\nyou been to africa guess what that is the way they live miles\nand miles and miles of shanties not a store nothing absolutely\nnothing so\nwhen you are looking at that what are you looking at you are\nlooking at the condition of a human being what is wrong with this\nworld i\ncannot change the world in a day i cannot change the\nattitudes of an entire planet but collectively as more and more\npeople move into this circle it starts to spiral and it starts to\nmove we\nstart to understand that the money that we currently have if you\nhave $50,000 sitting in the bank instead of saying yeah i am going to buy a car i am going to get a little\nmaserati actually it probably is not enough for this is it i do not\nknow but\nif you have a lot of money and you are thinking about that i am\ngoing to tell you that you are still thinking the wrong way think\nabout what you can do to your home to help the environment think\nabout what you can do in your back yard to plant some food so you\ndo not have to buy it think about what you can do to your car\nfor biofuels \u2013 and i am not talking about corn-crop\nbiofuels because there is new technologies out there that we\nall need to get on we\nneed to take action in any way possible and we need to take action\ntogether when\ni started i said i was healed because of the people in this room and\nthe people from project camelot and i truly believe that because i\ncould not move i could barely move i could not even hold\nthe phone talking on that interview with kerry and bill i had to\nkind of put it there put the pillow up and and i could not\neven hold the phone and i got up and walked so\nthe great gathering is coming and what i am going to say to you\nis watch for it and watch for your part in it and how it is that you\ncan help now a lot of people have been contacting me because i put that video out\non project camelot two things first\nof all i am putting a whole new website together there is\ngoing to be constantly new things coming up on it over the course of\nthe next week and it is going to be getting bigger and bigger\nand bigger so please go and check out my website to find out what\nelse you can be doing because it is going to keep expanding secondly i want you to know that what you can do you are already doing and\nthat is network network network network because when the call\ncomes out i\ndo not have this confirmed but i had someone tell me once that\nthe tiananmen square when that happened  the falun\ngong\n(hopefully i said it right people that follow falun\ngong\n within one hour rallied 10,000 people into tiananmen\nsquare which is why the government in china no longer allows you know they are really against falun gong now be very careful how you end up using your network be aware that you\nare waiting for the moment to arrive when this moment arrives and\nyou get the call and it is time i would love to see every\nnetwork whether it is people who are following ets \u2013 they want\nthe spiritual knowledge the technology people people who have the\nprograms for clean water for poverty again i am not really interested in people that are just interested in\nufos and ets i am interested in everyone so when that network\ngoes out it is not going to be oh\nwell come and join us at the et gathering\n it is going to be come\nand join us at the human gathering and\nso keep building your network in your personal life to the fullest\nextent that you can and is possible \u2013 which is what we have\nall been doing for the last you know how many years something\nreally important for myself that i want to say to everyone out there\nis it\nwould not be possible for me to stand here or for any of the\nspeakers to be here if it was not for people like you it\nwould not be possible for me to stand here personally if it\nwas not possible for all of those individuals who took all of\nthat ridicule all of the hardships all of the difficulties that\nthey had they\nmade it easy for me because 21 years ago when i had my contact my\nbig physical contact 21 years ago i could not say et i could not say alien i could not say craft i could not say spiritual\nknowledge i could not say propulsion\nsystem i could not say alien\ntechnology i could not talk so\nwe have slowly been building and building and building and you are\nthe first primary big wave you have the ability through your voice through your heart through your actions and through your\nresponsibility to be able to make the changes that are necessary all\nof these things that i am saying to you \u2013 all of them every single word that i am saying to you \u2013 is not my\npersonal thinking unless i tell you that and i will say it this\nis what i personally think these are the messages that were given to me by these ets \u2013\ndirect messages i\nwish i could take myself and put them into each person just for 5\nseconds and plop\nback out again because man i am telling you we had be on\nfire if we did that so\ni am working on a lot of different projects and i want to also\nsay thank you to everyone for assisting me because if i was not\nassisted i would not be able to be here right now and from my\ncar accident i do not know how i would have gotten home and\ngotten the care that i needed when i was here my\nfriend who\nwas\nwith me in the car accident is fine he had a bit of whiplash he is\ngot a few issues with his back and neck still and he is still in\nrecovery as well but he is feverishly helping me to get this new\nwebsite going and to do a number of different things so\ni just want to say thank you to everybody for everything i\nhave no idea how much time i have left but i want to know if any one\nof you has a question audience\nmember hi first what is the name of your website the new website that is coming up  he is working on it\nright now  is www.bluestarprophecy.com am\n1 okay one more question you spoke briefly about mayans if my\nunderstanding is correct according to drunvalo melchizedek well apparently drunvalo melchizedek claims he has been chosen by one of\nthe senior mayan councils as a spokesperson for them and i am\nwondering basically if you have any comment in regards to some of\nthe stuff that he is been talking about if you have any\nknowledge from the inside i have great respect for all indigenous people and the people that\nare coming forward drunvalo has been chosen by the mayan council to\ncome forward and speak and that is their business that is\nwhat they are doing right now the mayan council did in fact receive messages and i know this for a fact to come forward i\nhave great respect for everyone in south america including the\nindividuals from the mayan council that he is dealing with however if you hear the mayan council or if you hear drunvalo \u2013 and i am\nsorry i am going to be in some hot water over this i am\nsure \u2013 talk about other tribes i am not going to say that\nwhat he is saying is not correct what\ni am going to say is use\nyour discretion\n because the mayans themselves are speaking on behalf of other\ntribes and i know that these things are not correct i have to be\ncareful as to how i deal with that but it is a very\nbig issue\nright now know\nthis also that there are many councils from what i understand of\nthe mayans i have only heard the voice of one man so far myself personally i do not need to be running around talking\nto all these indigenous people boosting myself up you know for\nmyself i do not need that acknowledgement what\ni need to know is that they are willing to come together without\nego without ego and again without ego so\nif you are speaking you are speaking for yourself if i am\nspeaking i am speaking for myself if the mayans are speaking i ask the mayans to be respectful and speak for themselves that is\nwhat i ask for from the mayans or from any tribe no this is not about the individual whether it is an individual\ncollective or an individual self this is about unity and the\nhumanity and the heart of all of man so this issue for me has been\nextremely challenging now something in this also i made a comment that someone from south\namerica was doing black magic on me and i know that they were this\nwas not because people have asked me about this they\nsaid was\nit george green i am\nlike no it was not george green yeah can you see him with the little i\ndo not think so it was not george green and\nit was not the mayans so i will just leave it at that but it\nwas someone that i know is doing it the point in that is yes just\nbe cautious am\n1 what was the article that you have been created if you can tell\nus and\nwhat will its purpose be and\nwhen do you think the great gathering will be the piece itself i cannot talk to you about in detail at this time it will come forward at a later date the\ngreat gathering is in the process of being it is always been in\nthe process of being made through networking through talking to\npeople and through laying foundations do i know when it will be no but i am going to pray and i ask you all to pray that it will\nhappen as quickly as possible you will all know believe me am\n1 i know i asked a question before but why in your opinion did\nthey choose you to contact and do they want more people to be contacted or do they want more\npeople to continually actively spread this message yes why was it that i was (quote chosen am i\nspecial no what\ni was is i am an individual i am at least in part a\nhuman being probably more than et but i believe i have et dna in\nme my family lineage will go all the way back to the beginning of\nhuman life and the creation of these bodies this is one of the\nreasons why certain families will have et contact from generation to\ngeneration so\nit is not the individual it is whether or not the physical\nbody is strong enough to able to withstand the higher vibrational\nfrequency of what it is that is coming through so did that\nanswer it a little bit darrell darre\n everyone in this audience will want to know i am a hopi i am\nfrom the four mesas and miriam has come to visit us and bring her\nmessage we appreciate her visit she brings a message that will help\nus and other individuals on this earth in this community we are\ntrying to develop a good rap\nwith her and\nwe appreciate the information she brings we are hoping to work\ntogether share what we can with her accept what she brings to us we appreciate it thank you darre\n \n\n\n\n\n\n thank you am\n2 i want to thank you for bringing your story forward it is a\ngreat story but in your book you mentioned the appearance of a\nsecond sun i was wondering if you could briefly comment on that\nsymbol as it relates to the gathering i was told that a star would appear in the sky for all of man to\nsee nothing or no one would be able to hide its presence from the\nworld and it would be a sign to the people that the end was near i\nbelieve \u2013 not any other group \u2013 i\nbelieve that the comet holmes last year was the appearance of this\nblue star for a number of reasons i do believe that it was the blue\nstar that appeared and that there will be other signs coming to us when i know these signs i will let you know what\nit means is that we are in a window a time a time of choice and we\nhave very limited i am sorry i should not say limited we have a number of years not months but years before these great\nchanges take place if\nthey do because humanity has the ability to change any of these\ncataclysms that might take place to\naudience] i have time for one more quick quick question am\n3 could you go into a little about meditation like how does one go\nabout meditating okay meditation i think that what the real question that you are\ntrying to ask me and you can just nod if that is correct is\nhow do you contact these ets am\n3 okay because a lot of people ask me about that and kerry and bill\nare here so when i meditate i meditate just by laying down by\nsitting cross-legged by sitting in a chair i could be sitting\nacross from you and i could be meditating honestly meditation is being made something that it is not meditation is not\nabout sitting down for hours and hours and hours a day it is\nabout being productive with your meditation your meditation should\nbe taking place all day long every day it should be within your\nheart that you actually mediate so\nwhen you meditate the only requirement is to be able to be\ncomfortable to ground yourself protect yourself with light and ask\nyour guides to come to you whoever it is that they happen to be now for myself in making contact with the ets just because i call on\nthem does not mean that they come to me they come to me when\nthey can because there\u2019re not enough of them to go around but\nthey are contacting you\nin a dream in a vision in a feeling in many of these different\nways and they may be coming to you in your meditations and you do not\neven know it so\nif you want to make contact what i would suggest to you is that you\ncontinue to ask and if you want to see a craft continue to keep\nyour eyes open there is ways to be able to see things and\nmany people not a huge lineup but a fair number of people who have\nbeen around me and spent time with me and truly listened to what i\nwas saying to them and really paid attention to the fact that they\nneed to keep their eyes open have then ended up having sightings of\ntheir own that they know for sure was craft or orbs so\nonce you get to my website and everything\u2019s all up i am\ngoing to be doing videos about how you can do all this because i want\nto get as much information as i can out here and\nso am i done bill\nry  you are done so just before you go again my website\u2019s\nwww.bluestarprophecy.com and i have a couple of books here and i can take some orders if\nyou want and so forth again whatever we can do in this community i am going to ask this they do not even know i am going to say this if\nyou want to take responsibility and you want to make a difference please do one thing \u2013 support kerry and bill bill\nry  thank you intro dr pete\npeterson (pp i wonder i look at earth and i look at the things we have done to destroy\nthis fragile little spaceship that we live on going through space you know we talk about burning we talk badly about all the burning\nof the rainforests in brazil and yet most of the oxygen\u2019s\nproduced by plankton our use of nickel-cadmium batteries and lead\nbatteries and putting them out into the environment has killed a\ngood part of the plankton cetaceans are beaching themselves so that\nthere is enough food left for the others start of interview kerry cassidy\n(kc so pete we are very very happy to be able to connect with\nyou and you have been very generous with your time with your\nenergy i hope i have a little more energy left because i am\ncoming after bill and after david and i just have a few wrap-up\nquestions that i want to run by you and we will see how this\ngoes so one of the leading things you\nsaid was that you were involved with robots that is correct i am just wondering if we\ncould kind of drill down there a little bit and talk about what your\nbackground was and how involved you really were with robots well having been involved with\ntrying to build flying saucers you usually found that with flying\nsaucers if you look at most of the movies there always seems to be\na robot involved with it so i was very interested in robots in the early\ndays when i built a satellite tracking station before there were\nsatellites then tracked the russian sputnik\nwhen it was launched and called the government and told them the\nlaunch trajectory and the orbital and the frequency it was\ntransmitting on \u2013 during the mccarthy era \u2013 they thought\nmaybe i was a communist pinko so\nthey came and found out that i actually had a satellite tracking\nstation before there were satellites i was about 17 years old at the\ntime so that got a lot of notoriety here\nin\nidaho at that point\nin time in idaho on the eastern side of the state there was a place\nthat was called the atomic energy commission a nuclear reactor test\nsite it is where the first nuclear power generation was done anyway they anticipated having some nuclear problems there and\ndecided they need some robotic-type thing that could waltz into a\nnuclear meltdown and pull the reactor apart so that they would not\nhave a china\nsyndrome\ntaking place so eventually\ni and a few of my friends got the contract to do robots that could\ndo that i naturally had great faith in myself and said oh\nsure i found out a lot of things that\nwas a tremendous education i found out that materials that were\nelectrical conductors inside of a heavy nuclear flux became\ninsulators and insulators became conductors and david wilcock\n(dw really very stiff metals became\nlike toast and very brittle and broke apart or like ashes materials\nlike ashes became very hard and grease became like welds so eventually\nwe built a couple of different types of i will not call them\nrobots because they were truly manipulators they were devices that at one end looked exactly like we think of a\nrobot looking it had a pair of arms that would move and grip actually we designed them so if you could grip a beaker of liquid you could move it very rapidly and it would tilt it accordingly and\nnot spill it you could reach around behind you or in front of you or out to the side then on the\nbottom of it we had some that had three rolling wheels and some had\nlittle tank treads so this was in the 1955-6-7-8 region of time at that point did they have ai no the term had not even\nbeen invented yet so anyway on the other end of this device that\nlooked at one end like a robot was a thing that a person got into they had a couple of small one-inch television tubes with lenses on and they had put those on and they could see stereoscopically then\nthey had a couple of little hands that they could move their arms and\nhands like it and the robot would move accordingly \u2013 the\nmanipulator would move accordingly and there could be a distance right they could be back at there could be any distance up\nto 20 or 30 miles but it required wires at the time later we made\nsome that worked on radio waves but for working with atomic\nmaterials radio waves could be interfered with a number of things they could not withstand that type of lack of physical security so all of them that we did for them had wires so let us fast-forward to\na lot more recently or at least may be not even recently i do not\nknow when it is you got really involved in ai and you started to well first i got involved in\ncomputers in 1975 76 we built a computer that was used in\ntokyo at the airport to announce the plane flights in a number of\ndifferent languages it was the first use i know of a microprocessor\nchip in a real product then later we\nbuilt a computer training device to teach people how to use\nmicroprocessors and how to use software to accomplish various tasks we built that at a little computer company whose name was cyberdyne and one of the people who worked for us later worked on terminator\nwhatever-it-was well that\nwas my next question so i am not sure how you\nwant to answer this but the movie terminator is not so far off base am i right no it is not so far off\nbase at all once we got those working \u2013 and it is\ninteresting to note that the computer chip we used in the 1970s there are more of those produced monthly than all the intel chips\nproduced in a year even today because it is a chip that was\nactually designed like a computer whereas the intel chips are not\ndesigned like computers intel is\npaying a lot of royalties to various people who worked in and on\nvarious chips that evolved over the proper\nevolution of computer chips \u2013 what i consider to be proper we\nnow have a chip that is very very tiny and has a number of\ncomputers built into it that automatically look at the task and adapt\nthemselves so you may have 10 20 30 computer chips working on 30\nprocesses all at once in the body of one robot in a\nchip well in the body of one\nlittle tiny tenth-of-an-inch-square chip that is operating the\nrobot that is\noperating a robot but once we figured out the right language to use and the right computer design to use i then got involved with a\nnumber of people working on building an artificial intelligence chip\nthat we will call basically the call on it was a fuzzy\nlogic\nchip it turns out\nthe only logic that is not fuzzy is fuzzy\nlogic it is a chip that can look at a number of different inputs and\nfrom those make a decision that is correct so with the\nrobot you can be looking at bumps on the floor you can be looking\nat a doorway as compared to a wall you can look at somebody standing\nbetween you and the door you can look at the width of the door and\nthe height of the door and decide whether it can go through it or\nnot it can go over there and manipulate around the person go\nthrough it not trip over the cat on the floor etcetera etcetera all using fuzzy\nlogic then because a chip was doing\ndigital computing \u2013 a fuzzy logic chip either does digitally\n(if it is high-speed enough it does analogue computing \u2013\nit looks at things as we see them in the real world the floor can be\nlooked at digitally like it had millions and millions of little tiny\nbumps or larger bumps or it can be looked at analogue-wise because\nit can sense the roll of the floor and move the wheels and so-forth\nso it does not tip over but were not the japanese really advanced in terms of robotics well i\ncan tell you that when i went to the idaho national engineering labs which is what the atomic energy commission became which was one of\nthe nation\u2019s largest research centers it is in eastern\nidaho i think there are 2,200 ph.d.s that work there the whole town\nis built around in fact several towns are built around that\ncenter and much\ngoes on there when we went\nthere visiting with super-capacitors that i brought out of the\nukraine i got talking to some people who found out i was the one who\nbuilt the manipulators and they said they had a large contingency of\njapanese robotics experts this was in about 1987 88 somewhere in there they had a large japanese conference over trying\nto sell them manipulators and robots and when they saw my robots\nthey said my\ngod we do not have anything like this where in the world did\nthese come from we said hell we have had it for 50 years soturns out it was only about 43 years at that time but so basically you were working\nin black projects were not you well one could say that i just\nhave a curious question and we have not gone over this ahead of\ntime so i do not know if you can even talk to this but it is\nnot diabolical or anything but i am curious because i used to\nlove robots and sort of went on the net and sort of studied and was\ninterested in how far they have progressed with all of that one\nof the biggest problems they used to have was when they wanted them\nto walk upright like humans that they would fall over how did you\nsolve that well we\ndid it much the same way that dean kamen built\nhis two-wheeled scooter are you familiar with the oh yeah the what do they\ncall that segway segway the segway it is\nvery simple to do which is if you can say well you simply have a sensor\nthat senses whether you are upright or not and if you are\nnot upright then you use fuzzy logic to put it back right bill ryan\n(br presumably that is the kind of stuff they put in the\nf-117 it would have fallen out of the sky if it had not had\nthat kind of yes it would right for\nexample the programming language that we use is called forth f-o-r-t-h it should have been called f-o-u-r-t-h because\nit was the fourth major programming language but in those days computers would not take five characters rather six\ncharacters so they had f-o-r-t-h okay so\nthis kind of segues into mind control because i also know that you\nworked with sri and you\nworked with hal puthoff right and i understand you probably knew\ningo swann and a lot of the people involved in remote viewing so what i was wondering i\nthink you were involved in mk ultra and you can probably talk about\nthat since it is been declassified right well you can think about that\nall you want to think about it and who knows whether it is\ntrue i do not know whether that is true all right i know that i worked in a lot\nof very interesting areas but you know that mk ultra is\ndeclassified i do not know anything\nabout mk ultra okay i mean i have heard about it and heard about it and heard about it i\ndo not know anything about it i know some things that came out\nof it and i know that i researched some of those things and i built\nthings that i thought were better and turned them over to the\ngovernment but other than that i really do not know i\nactually do not know that much about it okay is it true that you are\nstill on call for the government well i am doing things\nall the time that i get calls on for a number of different\ngovernments actually i am actually a member of the\nastronautics association for mankind which is the russian equivalent\nto nasa i am on the board of directors so why\nare not you on the board of directors for nasa if you are\non the russian board well mainly because i have no\ndesire to be with a bunch of clowns okay if i wanted to be with clowns i had join a circus so you are really aware of the secret space program in essence and you know that nasa is something of a front for almost a\ndistraction i have not been associated\nwith them for years so i have no idea what they are doing okay but you said nasa\u2019s\na bunch of clowns why are you saying that well because all i have to do\nis look at the products they have why are\nthey still i mean i know they are going to retire the\nspace shuttle any day but it is basically a tin can going up in\nspace why are they even dealing with that kind of technology at this\npoint do you know because\nthey have it and it works they have had about maybe it\ndepends on how you look at reality they have what i consider to be\nabout 10% of the budget that they really ought\nto have if you look at\nthe things that came out of the space program through nasa probably\n50 to 60 percent of the technology we use today throughout all\nindustries came out of na the metallurgy technology and alloys the temperature-resistant plastics and metals large-scale integrated\ncircuits you know basically even the whole transistor technology i worked in things like that my\ncousin and i did quite a number of spy satellites we did the\nsampling arm that went on the viking lander to mars which by the\nway was run by a forth-programmed computer so i worked\nin and around that area i worked with north american rockwell jpl jpl a number of different\nplaces and got to see the things that came out of there i got to\nsee brand new things that were 20 years ahead of anybody on earth\nactually applied and things that were made from them and they were\nsent into space and they recorded things from space the camera that\nyou are shooting me on the image sensor in there was basically\nmade for use in outer space that is where they came from so if you look at return on\ninvestment there is not a corporation ever in the history of\nmankind that returned so much on the investment even 10 of the\nreturn on investment that came out of nasa it literally transformed\nour lives into a whole new century yet they take that which is the\nonly success story that i think man really has and totally\nmal-funded it now part of the reason was that they would not\npay the appropriate amount of money to get the brainpower that they\nneeded people early on worked for nasa not because they got paid\ngood money but because they got to accomplish their dream when\nfinally congress snuffled their dream they quit working for nasa so\nnow you had clowns working for nasa it should have been a circus not that there were not great\npeople there and not that there are not great people there but\nthey are totally frustrated i am sure right but there is also a\nlot of black projects going on under the table i do not know that they are\ngoing on at nasa really they may be i do not\nknow what about your familiarity\nwith things like superluminal travel my familiarity hmm well no i do not know anything about superluminal travel well we\nhave testimony from henry deacon and from jake simpson a couple of\nwhat we call whistleblowers which in essence is what you are at\nthis point in your career in a way mmm well in a way okay you are treading a\nfine line treading a fine line and they\nare testifying that we have superluminal travel that we have craft\nthat go outside the solar system can you say anything about that i know nothing about it okay you told us or at least\nyou talked to me at one point about being a spymaster is that really\ntrue i do not know a thing\nabout that okay okay well we are\nkind of striking out here where do you think that we can go with all\nof this well i\ntold you the things that i am  willing to talk about now you are trying to get me to talk about them and\nuh all right what do you know\nabout a ufo detector i was asked to build a ufo\ndetector when i was about 14 and eventually built one okay and it is\noperational i have no idea when it is\noperational the best i know they smashed it immediately who is \u201cthey the government actually the\npresident of the united states at that time really okay now here\u2019s a problem\nwith it i had love to do something with it it is a very\nsimple inexpensive technology it is based on wilhelm reich's\ntechnology no it\nhas nothing to do with wilhelm reich it is based on science the problem with it is that it works in such a manner that it will\ndetect virtually every single type of thing in the universe what\nthat means is that it would be the best anti-collision device that\never went on board an airplane because it could see every other\nairplane in the sky that is the good news okay the bad news is it can see any\nstealth plane just as easily as it can see a damned dirigible so that is why they\ndestroyed it i have no idea why they\ndestroyed it well can we surmise that\nthat is why they destroyed it i have no idea i do not\nknow that it was destroyed i am just telling you that is\nmy feeling because i have never well you told me they took it i have never seen one well i thought you yeah they took it so what did they do with it i do not know if\nthey put it in their pocket or put it in the remnants of the\nsmithsonian i do not know what happened to it but i have\nnever seen one out there in operation i could tell if there were one\nin operation but how could you tell because of how it works well i mean i am not about to tell the\nsecrets of it i understand that but you i cannot talk about it\nwithout telling the secret of it you would know if somebody was\noperating your device i had\nknow if anybody was operating one of them how would you know that unless\nyou are operating i would know that because of\nhow it works okay would you remote view\nthem or would you be no not at all you have a tracking device on\nyour invention it emits something that is\nabsolutely unique to the device oh wow okay there is\nanother kind of detector which was\ndestroyed upon presidential order i understand yes there was are you able to talk about\nthat because that is a fantastic story probably not it is\nprobably not healthy for you guys to talk about it okay well i understand that you \u2013 and i do not know if you can\ntalk about this \u2013 but my understanding is that with robots with any kind of device that you are operating using ai or any\nother kind of as you say manipulator or whatever that there sort\nof has to be a fail-safe or a command override such that you\ncall it a gatekeeper i believe no a gatekeeper\u2019s a\nproduct that allows that to take place or not to take place or not to\ntake place and yes there is a obviously it is\nlike with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs nuclear devices and\ncruise missiles and whatever one thing you do not want is your\nenemy to get hold of it and use it against you so there must-needs\nbe some methodology to handle that are you able to say that you\nhad a hand in creating some gatekeepers oh i created gatekeepers and\nwhether they use it there or not i do not have any idea i just\nknow they buy a lot of gatekeepers or bought a lot of gatekeepers i\nknow that right now we are in the process of negotiating a very\nlarge order for gatekeepers \u2013 what i call gatekeepers what\nthey are going to use them for i really cannot mention would you call yourself sort of\nan inventor how would you i have always billed myself as\nan instrument maker okay i build instruments that see\nthings or hear things or measure things that heretofore nobody\nelse builds anybody else builds something i do not ever\nreplicate it i do not reinvent anybody\u2019s wheels i invent\nmy own wheels okay i want to kind of go into\na different area that we have not really addressed at the\nmoment and i want to know if because obviously i realize\nthere is a lot you are not talking about and there is\nsome stuff that we have got off the record and all of this kind\nof thing but do you feel that you are protected yes do you feel you are\nprotected on an earthly level or on other levels as well definitely on an earthly level i have no idea about other levels however when you say feel as compared to know then i will tell you that i have had a charmed life okay i can remember one time in\nvietnam standing in a firefight and remember that basically only\nmachine guns fire tracer bullets every fifth round in our machine\nguns at least is a tracer so the machine gunner can aim his weapon\nbecause they are jiggling and bouncing so much you cannot\nreally use a sight well so you want to see where the bullets are\ngoing and place them where you want them so every fifth bullet goes\nout and you see a little red glow where the bullet us going i was in\nfirefights where the tracers were so thick it was like you were in\nthe middle of a 30-foot campfire that was down to the ashes with a\nweed-eater whipping up sparks i remember about the third time i\nlooked up and said you and me big al all the way because i knew i was being kept alive there was no reason\nfor me to be alive fifty percent of the marine officers i went to\nvietnam with were killed while they were there they were there for\n13 months i was there for 23 or 24 months but anyway and to this day you feel that\nyou are protected well i have been in other\nplaces that were even scarier than that and i have done crazy\nthings all my life to invent things fast rather than slow and take\nit the hard way instead of the easy way and so forth and somehow\nlived through all of it you know i get the biggest kick\ntoday out of some kids spilled a little tiny bottle of\nmercury in a town nearby and they came and dug an olympic swimming\npool in their front yard and hauled all the dirt off and charged\nthem thousands and thousands of dollars to get rid of the mercury hell i used to spill two or three ounces of mercury a day in my lab which was down in a basement and the only thing it did probably is\ndrop my iq by 30 or 40 points but but that did not really\nmatter considering how high it is i used to go around with a\npiece of lead solder hanging out of my mouth i must have spent 20\nyears with a piece of solder sticking out of the corner of my mouth getting that good lead all that did was drop my iq another 10 or 20\npoints so yeah i have been\ncharmed okay have you been threatened oh yeah i have been\nthreatened a number of times by just about every kind of person that\nwould want to threaten me you can\nmake a joke about bastard\nschool as\nwell that is a good one well that was what i was\ntrying to get to but you can\ntalk about bastard\nschool a.k.a terrorism school can we\ntalk about bastard\nschool\nat all well yeah okay and what was your\nexperience with that well i\ncall it bastard\nschool when i was an officer in the military very obvious i was trained in\nmilitary things i was taught to be the biggest s.o.b on the block i got so good at it they finally turned around and had me do some\nother things because it scared them to death because i was a mean green killing machine so instead of\nteaching terroristic things they had me teach anti-terroristic\nthings then they \u2013 in both cases \u2013 one they were afraid\nthat the enemy would learn what i was doing that was nasty then they\nthought the enemy might learn what i was doing to disrupt being\nnasty so then they moved me on to other things you have\ndealt with mind control in some ways in some fashions you know\nsomething about the mind clearly and about this information field i am wondering if there is something within the information\nfield and/or the mind-body interaction that can be set up to protect\noneself against let us say mind control devices such as the\ndigital television that is now projecting \u2013 you know able to\ncommunicate with people in their houses and so on so forth well that is an\nassumption that we are making right i am making that\nassumption not you so i am just asking is there something some technique there are things that were\ndesigned specifically as an example in the probably 80s the russians had a thing that was because it sounded like a\nwoodpecker on the shortwave radio was called the woodpecker they had three\nlarge locations that were transmitting probably several million watts\nper location and they were phased in a particular area so they\ncould move where the peak of that electromagnetic wave would fall it\nturns out that one of the places here they had it fall was in a town\ncalled eugene oregon people there\nwere getting sunburns while they slept at night and they were\ngetting headaches and they were having birth defects and so forth the woodpecker had a very strong signal there and a highly\ninterfering signal it was also at a psycho-active frequency so that\nit would disrupt the appropriate thinking capabilities of the brain this is\nall documented by the way on the net oh yeah it is all documented on the net also a good friend of mine was\nthe man who discovered they were bombarding the moscow embassy with\nmicrowaves that had much the same frequency content so there was\na fellow that designed a little device that you could wear under the\ncollar which was provided to all of our personnel that we needed to\nmake sure had clear thinking that they could carry with them and it\nwould send a signal a close-by signal remembering that\nelectromagnetic waves decrease with the cube of the distance after a\nvery short distance the signal\u2019s very very weak so you put a weak signal near the\nperson and drive their mind into a range of brainwaves that would be\nbenign or even hopefully beneficial they found a very simple way\nto find out what was beneficial and then a very simple way to tune\nthe device so that it would put those waves out they were carried by\nall types of diplomats and military personnel for years and years and\nyears so we\ncan assume that the president and various people are using these\ndevices to this day i would certainly think they\nwould be i know that i carry one around okay and you are saying\nthis person who invented it you are saying you are\nnot the person who invented it i did not say anything\nabout it okay but there is also a\ntechnique involved such that one can do it without the device if one\nlearns yeah you can learn to hold\nyour mind pretty much in whatever mode you want it has to do with the\ninformational field is that right no it does not it has to\ndo with the electromagnetic field oh really yep so you use your mind to affect\nthe electromagnetic field no you just use your mind to\ngenerate its own electromagnetic field at a benign frequency or even\na helpful frequency to counter it to\ncounteract it i will give you an example you get three or four\npeople that are very close or two people that are even closer and\nwhat you will get is you will get heartbeat synchronization \u2013\nwhich just occurs \u2013 and then you will get brainwave\nsynchronization then unfortunately or fortunately depending on\nthe situation you get hormone production and hormones are very very powerful messengers and then you get into trouble or\nnot it is a form of\nentrainment right it is\na form of entrainment and you get an entrainment so a very weak\nsignal can give you great entrainment nicola tesla made a device that used\ncompressed air and it was a little weight he could stick that on\nthe ground outside of a skyscraper in new york and this thing would\nsense ground-wave oscillations and tune itself to them so it would\nstart out very rapidly and slow down and then it would find where it\nwas affecting the environment it would resonate with it it is\nlike if you have a wineglass here and you play your violin up scale eventually you will find where if you stop real quick you will\nhear the wineglass vibrating then if you play that note exactly pretty soon the wineglass will break because just a little\nbit it is like pushing a swing if you push the swing in\nphase the swing will go way high if you push it out of phase it will\nstop it will not go very high it will go high and then low\n a number of things you want to get it resonant or in phase so that is\nwhat tesla\u2019s device would do it would move a weight up and\ndown up and down up and down using pneumatic pressure and pneumatic\nvalving and he had make a skyscraper just wag like a dog\u2019s\ntail in new york so is not\nthis like sort of the kernel behind mind control getting a very slow\nresonance set up and then affecting it one way or another no no no no does not\nhave much to do with mind control but part of what you want to do perhaps with mind control is get your mind in a certain frequency but that is old-style mind control what you want to do now basically if you want to look at neuro-linguistic programming using\nthe principles of neuro-linguistic programming is much more powerful\nthan getting a brainwave entrainment brainwave\nentrainment will drop the iq it will drop the attention span it will change the memory so there are a number of things that\ncan be done there but what we use now is a thing that changes the\nway the brain is attached to itself and the way the brain hooks\ntogether and we just change the neural pathways you can cause\na person to forget you can cause a person to do things that they\nhave no intention of doing you can make a stimulus that would cause\none thing like a stimulus that would cause me to reach out and grab\nsome water and take a drink because i was thirsty you can very\nquickly and easily change that stimulus to when i get thirsty i will\nreach out and grab a glass of water and pour it down my neck pour it\ndown the front of my suit so what\nabout the idea that you were telling us about the piece of the heart you could cut off a piece of the heart and give it to somebody who\nwould recognize it \u2013 a doctor \u2013 who would recognize it as\na part of the brain or have resonance on the it would appear to be brain\ntissue and this is a medical fact right it is\na medical fact there is a very good book that anyone who has a\nchild that does not read this book should be jailed kerry\nlaughs] i am serious it is called the\nmagical child\nby joseph chilton pearce p-e-a-r-c-e and he has follow-up\nbooks on it for example the\nmagical child matures\ntells you why that no center-city fatherless child is ever going to\namount to anything ever they cannot because their brain\ndoes not form properly really yep a fatherless child well or motherless an orphan a child that is raised\noutside of a normal family environment let us put it that way that is much more accurate it will tell you why that cannot\nhappen why they cannot really become useful to society well is this the thing you\nwere telling us about the heart being close to the heart it is\npart of it that is part of it that is just part of it there are a number of different factors but one of the things that\npearce writes about in the\nmagical child\nis for example that during the first 16 days or so after the\namniotic fluid breaks the child is exposed to the electromagnetic\nfield from the mother\u2019s heart beating and that field is\nmodulated by what is in the brain cells in the heart which are\nthe emotions and those emotions are transferred to the child so they\nthought well\nthat may be true they went to europe where a lot of women have their children raised\nby wet nurses who nurse them on their breast and they find out that\nthe child takes on the emotional content of the wet nurse or\nchildren who are raised without a father never get the emotional \u2013\nthe male emotions \u2013 from the father as compared to the female\nemotions but you are saying it\nhappens in the first 16 days after that the greater part of it happens\nin the first 16 to 18 days incredible it turns out for example the\nrussians did brilliant and massive research on this they found out\nthat if the child is born underwater in a fluid \u2013 remember the\nchild\u2019s already in a fluid it is not going to hurt him to\nbe underwater for a while the child\u2019s born under water in the\nfluid about body temperature and moved up with contact with the\nmother to the breast where if you look at how you would\nnaturally hold your arms and nurture a child the heart of the mother\nand the heart of the child are going to be right next to each other the child starts picking things up if the child is kept in that\nposition for the first 12 to 14 hours the child usually develops\nspeech by six months of age and is able to stand on their own at six\nmonths of age can you talk about that russian\ndoctor i unfortunately i could if i remembered his name i cannot remember his name he\nwas brought to the united states i can tell you that his\ntechniques were used by madonna in having her children we were talking about\ngenerating an iq as high as 275 in the children right i can tell you that her\nchildren are some of the most brilliant children on the face of the\nearth because of that i know that she worked using those techniques\nfor a year to a year and a half before they were conceived just to\nbecome ready that could well be privileged information but it\nleaked out to me and i know it to be true so you are saying that the\nheart has an information field component which somehow entrains the\nformation of the nervous system no i am not saying\nanything about the information field i am saying the heart has\nan electromagnetic component that is there because the heart beats\nand it takes a large electrical current to beat the heart okay the body is bioelectric anything near a magnetic field or an electric field that is\nconductive then has components that come from the things around it\nthat are electric or magnetic or conductive okay so you\ncan see that stuff in the heart field the information\n\u2013 not the information field\n\u2013\nthe information\ntransfers to the \u2013 just like programming a rom chip \u2013\ntransfers to the heart of the child as an example one of the final proofs of this is there was a man who absolutely\nhated the odor the sight and the taste of mustard and got a heart\ntransplant and all of a sudden could not get enough mustard just by happenstance the wife of the donor somehow got word to him\nthat her husband loved mustard so he had the heart that came along\nwith it a number of\npeople were in essence sobs or were very tense individuals and\nthey got a heart from a man who was a very calm man and all of a\nsudden their wife and their children did not even know who they\nwere they were a completely different person that information was encoded in\nthere and when the nerves were sewn together and some of them grew\nback that information got out of the heart it may well be that the\nmagnetic field of the heart transmitted and the brain picked it up i do not\nknow that but i know that we instrumented peoples hearts and\nwould let them see things that would excite them the heart rate\npicks up adrenalins produced maybe what they see causes anger or\nfear and if you anesthetize that part of the heart then they do not\nhave those fears and those angers and so forth so that\nemotional information and some things like preferences in flavor or\ncolor are transferred and transmitted in there so it is very\nimportant to get the child up into a nurturing position children who\nwere nurtured by both mother and father have both male and female\ncomponents children nurtured by one or the other have only the one\ncomponent of their emotional make-up and it is the first 16\ndays that does it is that right well read the book the\ngreater part of it occurs in the first 16 to 18 days and yes maybe\nthat is 30 maybe another 10% occurs in the next 50 days maybe\nanother 10% in the next 180 days okay but very early on as\nopposed to later very early on you want to get\nthat in there very early on okay i want to go in another\ndirection wait a minute \u2013 is there\nany other tissue in the body besides the heart that acts like\nneurological tissue oh absolutely now if you want you can call the pineal part of the\nbrain even though it does not do brain function it is\npart of the brain the pineal and pituitary are mostly a substance\ncalled melanin a type of melanin makes the skin pigment but they are\na slightly different kind of melanin i in my\nresearch have found that the melanin in the pineal \u2013 which in\neastern medicine is the third eye the seat of the third eye \u2013\nis very very very good at picking up informational signals and\nadding a time content to them thus subtracting a non-time content so it is always been attributed to clairvoyance clairaudience\nand so forth those are signals that are taken out of a signal that\nappears to be everywhere every-when it coheres that\nfor the person and they have certain abilities that they would not\nhave the tibetans\ndrill a hole in the front of the forehead with a little rock drill and then they poke a bamboo skewer in and manipulate the pineal to\n\u201copen the third eye what it does is it gives it a hole\nthrough the faraday\ncage speaking in science terms and it makes a sensitivity by making a\npiece of scar tissue that opens up or opens the third eye or opens\nclairvoyance or clairaudience or remote viewing or remote\ninfluencing or a number of different things is not it true that\nfluoride deadens or hardens the pineal gland absolutely but what it mostly\nhardens and since we have fluoride in\nour water basically you could look at that as an illuminati plot to\ndeaden the intelligence and the psychic ability of the population what i\ntry to do as a scientist is stay to scientific things i do not\npresume about what the illuminati want to do okay but i\ncan tell you that the main thing that halides \u2013 which are\nchlorine fluorine bromine \u2013 mainly what they do in the body\nis congeal cholesterol into arterial plaque i mean that is\nwell known so it\nslows down the blood flow in the arteries yeah it\ncloses down the arteries so there are many ways to sterilize water\nother than chlorine and fluorine there are many ways for example they say well we use fluorine\nfor\ntooth decay you have a\nwhole fleet of boats up and down the west coast of the united states\nand the east coast of the united states that cannot fish\nanymore because we have killed all the fish except there are\nbottom-feeders called i will not tell you the name of the fish but they are bottom feeders that is a fish that consists\nof 60% of the weight of the fish is liver and about 60% of the\nliver is that particular fish liver oil which contains a compound\ncalled \u201cactivator x by price of the price-pottenger\nfoundation of years-ago fame he found out\nright after world war ii that one drop of that well you can take\nthat fish oil which is highly-fishy-tasting get it cold the waxes\nand false isomers will solidify you can filter those out and the oil\nleft over has very little or no taste to it that oil you can put in\nthe sunlight and it will not turn rancid for hundreds of years it\nshould have been used in place of sperm whale oil for lubricating\nwatches but they did not use it for that is this cod liver oil no it is\nnot cod liver oil it is a different oil but those boats could\ngo out and bring back boatloads of this fish it grows from\nantarctica to  arctic and everywhere in between what does that have to do with\nfluoride in the water what it\nhas to do with is that that oil one drop put in a slice of bread \u2013\neaten daily \u2013 and you  have no caries whatsoever there is\nno tooth decay it eliminates tooth decay and they did this on\nthousands and hundreds of thousands of children in europe after world\nwar two and likewise you can guard\nagainst hardening of the arteries well then you do not get\nthe hardening of the arteries from the fluoride or the chloride now what happened was and i will take the hit for this let us\nput it that way it is my conjecture that the only reason we use\nchloride in the water was because the politicians have already spent\nall of the social security money so you have got to have\nsomething there so that people die at retirement age then because of health care\ngetting better we had to have something else that made it happen\neven faster so we put fluoride in the water wow that is something they could have gotten rid of\ntooth decay with an absolutely benign substance that we had a whole\nindustry here that could go out and bring us back all we could ever\nuse for the whole world very inexpensively and totally\nnon-negatively in the body but we did not do that now the\nreason that that fish oil does not turn rancid is obviously because it is an antioxidant it is the best antioxidant\nknown to man as far as i know price called it activator x it has a\ndefinite chemical formula it could definitely be put out there but\nit would eliminate most of heart surgery it would eliminate tooth\ndecay so it is not put out there because that is not\nefficient in our capitalistic system well you are talking\nworldwide though as well right yeah it\nwould be worldwide like i say we did it in europe after world war\nii for years but we took that activator x by the way there is\na small amount of it in wheat germ oil so that was taken from wheat\ngerm oil now we found \u2013 i found \u2013 the ratfish had this\nstuff in you know massive amounts when you said price did you\nmean dr weston price weston price yeah so it is\nmy conjecture they are only i mean the only reason i\ncould see that we would be using that is to kill people off why else\nwould you do that you are\nsaying about the pineal gland because i have a whole long section\nin my video that everybody\u2019s seen most of this audience has\nseen it all about the pineal gland so you are saying that\nthis oil if taken would help to decalcify the pineal gland or\nsomehow increase its sensitivity if the pineal gland is\ncalcified by halides yes it would okay but you are not naming the\nfish i was not really naming\nthe fish other\nthan the ratfish that you just talked about no and that is not the not the main source no that is what it is\ncalled in certain areas of the world hmm okay but i was curious you said something about you know there is camps being built\naround the united states do you know the purpose behind them yes they are camps to\ndetain people is this something that goes on\nthe tail-end because i am looking for the agenda that\ngoes behind the crash of the dollar that basically you are\nsaying is coming at some point in the near future quite possibly right that is what your sources are telling you i think that is a great\npossibility i am planning for it okay and then on top of it there are camps being built and you can verify that well they are giving tours of some of them and you go on the\ninternet and you will find out that there are a number of\nlocations where people say well here\u2019s a camp that is built okay and what about the role\nof viruses in eliminating the population is there any validity to\nthat i have no idea it is not\nmy area of expertise i have suppositions well you clearly are a healer so have you got advice on how people can protect themselves from\nviruses well i think all that advice\nis available if you just download it from the fda websites or the\nvarious websites of say fema and homeland security really oh absolutely wear a mask wash your hands they are absolutely\ncorrect okay another\ngood thing to do is go someplace  there is not a lot of\npeople we are sitting here filming in an area that there is\nnot a lot of people the town says entering\nthe town\non one side of the sign and on the other side of the signpost it\nsays exiting\nthe town and 1st street\u2019s in some great big city somewhere else because\n there is not another street okay well so what is\nit that you think is coming in the future in terms of let us\ntalk about outer space a little bit do you think that there is\nanything out there that we need to be aware of well i\nthink there\u2019re all kinds of things out there  we need to\nbe aware of okay i mean is the only\nthreat in other words is the only threat well it is a major threat\nthat we right now do not have any deterrent for what threat a threat from outside the\nplanetary bounds well what about the satellites that have recently been classified such\nthat they will not tell us about incoming bodies that is all\nclassified suddenly well that i do not know\nabout i did not realize that had been done but if it is\nbeen done it is obviously been done for some reason and that\nreason may be to stop panic i know the\ngovernment has a tremendous belief in whatever\nyou do do not cause panic in the people because when you cause panic in the people then it draws attention\nto the lawmakers the senate the congress the presidency and the\nruling party and they are not looking you know it is\nlike the old chinese curse may\nyou live in interesting times you know try to live in times that are not at all interesting they are boring as hell  nothing\u2019s going to happen so i think\nthat anything that might happen that would cause people to start\nthinking about well why is not something being done here we are out of money we have been out of money for years so\nwe do not have money to go do anything about it so why let the\npeople worry okay but you were telling me\nsomething about the fact that you think there is really only ten\nmonths left for the sort of rollout of what could be like reversing the agenda i mean i do not even know if you believe\nit is possible to reverse the agenda that is being rolled\nout at the moment you have said we have got about ten\nmonths because the earth we have polluted our own nest okay here\u2019re just a few things that you can look up and the things\ni talk about are things that are openly available on the internet library of congress or a lot of things now on youtube a lot of\nthings on you know ask.com and google.com and so forth you can go\nin there and start making searches and looking and you can find a\nlot of information there is a tremendous amount of information about about the\nthings that you just spoke about and specifically you can find out\nthat \u2013 oh it is about a couple weeks ago we just had a\nvery near flyby of a huge asteroid that would have caused depending on where it hit thousands if not millions of deaths on\nthe earth if it had hit the earth and it was a near flyby now maybe that nearness was 100,000\nmiles but 100,000 miles is sure different than the distance between\nhere and mars or here and pluto it came by very close it could\nhave been one of those things that hit the earth and we have nothing\nto stop something like that okay you are saying we have nothing to stop something is it possible\nblack\npeople in black projects\nhave\nsomething to stop that ed note no reference to\nafrican-americans intended]\n\n\n\n\n\n  no i do not believe so okay and what about if they did i do not\nbelieve they have had the money to build it and what about positive aliens do you think that they might interfere with something of that nature well if there are such things\nas positive aliens i think that yeah you know i wonder i look at\nearth and i look at the things we have done to destroy this\nfragile little spaceship that we live on going through space you\nknow we talk about burning we talk badly about all the burning of\nthe rainforests in brazil and yet most of the oxygen\u2019s\nproduced by plankton our use of nickel-cadmium batteries and lead batteries and putting them out into the environment has\nkilled a good part of the plankton cetaceans are beaching themselves\nso that there is enough food left for the others because they are that\nwise and self-sacrificial well i\nthink that they are and of course you had to have worked with them\nin some of the military programs to understand how wise they are okay well i am going to\nhave to wind this up i would love to talk to you all night and all\nday and especially if you were able to come out with some of the\nmore fascinating things that you are involved in but project camelot wants to thank\nyou very much i want to thank you for your service to humanity you have clearly been involved in some things that are healing\nfor the population out there you are here trying to testify to\nsomething coming that you firmly believe that people need to be aware\nof and so i want to thank you i\nappreciate your interest \u2013 anything that can get information\nout to the people and my suggestion to the people is because this\nstuff is not really hidden it may be squirreled away somewhere but\nit is there and you can go out and find the information for\nyourself my suggestion\nis you do it my suggestion is that you prepare yourself for an\nemergency because no matter what you do in life you are going\nto run into an emergency if you prepare yourself for it then you\nstand a very good chance of surviving it and if you do not\nprepare yourself for it you stand a very good chance of not\nsurviving it okay thank you and pete\npeterson i really want to thank you again bill you want to say any\nclosing words yourself i think this is the most\nimportant interview we have ever done okay and david you got\nanything you want to add to that well pete i just want to say\ni appreciate your courage for inviting us out here i think that the\ndata that you have given about the consciousness and the\ninformation field is really instrumental in my work and i hope we\ncan continue that discussion well i think that we will\nprobably continue a relationship for a long time and i am\nperfectly willing to share that information i am at a point in\nmy life that the only thing i can do now to make my life worthwhile\nis to share the wisdom that i have obtained as a stone rolling\nthrough this interesting experience of life on earth been involved with\ntrying to build flying saucers you usually found that with flying\nsaucers if you look at most of the movies there always seems to be\na robot involved with it bill ryan\n(br this is bill ryan and kerry cassidy from project camelot and\nthe date is we can never get the date right what is the\ndate kerry\ncassidy (kc the 26th the\n26th of july 2009 we are at the exopolitics summit in\nbarcelona spain and it is our huge privilege personally i\nmust say i want to ask kerry in a moment to add to my introduction\nhere i am going to introduce you alfred webre who is\nnever appeared on camera with us before alfred it is a\nprivilege to be talking to you alfred\nwebre (aw thank you i have\nbeen an admirer of yours for many years bob dean who has become a\nvery close personal friend over the last couple of years and he\nblames us entirely for his new-found popularity among all the young\nladies in the world who are following exopolitics bob dean\n(bd shame on you it is\neither you or sean connery he is\njust not available anymore all\nright absolutely and\nall this kidding notwithstanding we want to introduce somebody who\nwe have presented to the world over the last three years somebody\nwho we also know and love dearly and who is become a personal\nfriend for even longer than bob has we have\ncalled him \u201chenry deacon which seemed like a good idea\nat the time i cannot even start to call him his real name because i cannot even remember it because for me he is\nforever henry and henry it is entirely up to you whether you\nwant to reveal your name again henry\ndeacon arthur neumann (hd/an i will just say my\nname\u2019s arthur his\nname\u2019s arthur okay do you want to be\u2014and this is a\nserious question\u2014do you want to be known as arthur or art hd yeah just arthur thank you i am tired of the henry thing you are tired of the henry thing henry is dead long live\narthur hd and camelot and\ncamelot exactly it is got something to do with king arthur see he stole your name there you go in this life i am\ntaking up valuable time here because we are under some\nlimited time because bob\u2019s in demand as i just said and he is\ngot to rush off to his next appointment one of the\nreasons why this is an important conversation is because yesterday\nafternoon at the exopolitics summit when bob dean was giving what i\nhave put on our website and described as the most magnificent\npresentation at any ufo conference that i have ever heard and\ni will say this again on record it is fabulous and you will\nbe linked to that here he was\naffirming the reality of bases on the moon and mars and showing us\nphotographs that have never been shown before as least as far as i am\naware and it is extremely important testimony in a minute bob\nwill tell people i am quite sure how he feels now that he is\n\u201cunder orders from someone somewhere to speak out like\nhe has not spoken out before we salute you for that this is a\nvery brave thing that you are doing and it is incredibly\nimportant one of the\nthings that links the three witnesses that we have here\u2014we can\ncall you witnesses\u2014is something we could dub the martian\nconnection and with that i am going to hand over to kerry\nbecause i am talking too much already kerry okay well just hold on one second let us let arthur hd just something really simple before it slips my mind i was just\nsitting in the audience during the conference and the cameraman\nwas next to me and something popped up on the news that\nwas on c-span that i sent you and i just wanted to remind about\nthat it was one of the astronauts was talking about this too buzz\naldrin was talking about having what was a hd a\nmonolith on one of the moons of mars a\nmonolith on the moon hd and that just popped up in the last couple three days on\nthe moon hd no on phobos oh on phobos on the moon of mars right okay and you knew that right hd well no i was not aware of that no you\nwere not hd i\ndid not but\nyou told us about a monolith at one point do you recall that hd yes i have uh huh that\nwas a different monolith they are all over the place there\nyou go hd i\nwas hoping that you had have a chance to see arthur clarke\nseveral years ago oh we wish hd but it just did not work out it\ndid not work out actually it is interesting you mention him because we just\ntalked to another whistleblower this morning and he knew arthur\nclarke also so the two of you have something else in common hd mm\nhm okay so here we are i am kerry cassidy this is bill ryan we are\nproject camelot for those of you that do not know and this is\ngoing to be just some open conversation what we want to do is talk\nabout the future because what this really is is what we call a\nfuturetalk it is a conversation that means bill and i are\ngoing do something really annoying  we are going to talk from\ntime to time more than normal but we\nreally want to hear from you guys and what we had like to talk\nabout is your visions of what is coming in the future in the\nfairly-near future ideally but you can go as far out as you had\nlike and why do not we start with alfred webre oh thank you well i see the future as being shaped by two fundamental\nforces perhaps three one  a series of cosmic cycles which are\nsychronistically happening at the same time during solar cycle 24 which is 2009 to 2020 with the solar maximum being around 2013 2012 to 2013 the\ntime acceleration matrix which is an adaptation of the mayan\ncalendar so that as we move into 2011 the black hole at the center\nof the galaxy which really mediates a lot of our thoughts will be\nslipping over into universal consciousness non-dualism and\nfinally what some people call \u201cgalactic genetic engineering that is the power of the black hole at the center of the galaxy\nreally kicking in to activate our dna ninety-seven percent of which i understand is not active now\u2014they call it \u201cjunk they\ncall it junk but it is not junk right exactly so these are all sort of raising the capacity of not\nonly the human beings but of all living things to a new frequency a new understanding a new kind of social contract if you want to\nput it that way yeah and i think arthur you could maybe talk to that because you might\nhave a different i do not know if you call yourself a\nphysicist officially hd no no but you certainly have some expertise in that area hd well i do not have expertise but in some of what you just\nsaid you took some of the words out of my mouth so you already said\nsome of what i would have said about all these well as david\nwilcock\u2019s talking he is making a movie called\nconvergence and this is what is happening all these\nvarious things are all just converging i was\nlooking at a little child yesterday a little girl and seeing her\neyes and i just i could see the difference you know of the next\ngenerations you can see it even in someone maybe 20 years old that they are already very advanced consciously advanced arthur when we met you for the first time which is almost three\nyears ago i remember very very clearly that this is one of the\nfirst things that you told us you said the big issue right now is\nthat everything is happening at once or just about to hd yes can\nyou delineate can you list what are those factors that are\nhappening at once just so people know what we are looking for hd well the physical factors already just mentioned the cyclic\nfactors very long cycles and short cycles the effect of the star the sun here the spectral changes in the sun and things that i\nguess cannot be measured i do not know for me it is\nan intuitive type of feeling and not a scientific thing i am\nnot sure but there are things that you have been briefed on well you have already talked the environment you talked about what\nwas planned in terms of viruses that were planted around the world sort of like time bombs somewhat and you also talked about a\nroll-out that would affect our economy etc etc hd well these are different from the changes okay i mentioned\nnovelty theory which terence mckenna who is deceased\nnow who lived on the big island of hawaii i believe he talked\nabout he had i guess a calculation for it and that mathematical\nequation can be found on the internet i guess and you can see that\nit comes down to zero at 2012 approximately from what i remember and\nthat means what that novelty goes down to zero hd well novelty it becomes more novel in my opinion okay that is what i am asking hd yeah to me it means more novel well novel to me means \ni would laugh you know about it but it is not  i do not\nhave the words i do not have the ability to put things into\nwords that some of these gentlemen do to put things in words let\nme interpret this for you then you can check my reflection hd all right i\nread a book called future shock by alvin toffler many many\nyears ago who said that the rate of change is accelerating hd oh\nyeah so you have got a logarithmic change here such that everything\nis starting to change hd exactly and\nit is like there are statistics which i cannot quote off\nhand but it is like 99 percent of all the innovations in human\nhistory have happened in the last year hd yeah or\nsomething like that and the whole thing is going vertical hd my\nfeeling is that as of about two months ago just because there is\nno direct marker that maybe two months ago when i started weaning\nmyself off of morphine for four years because you were on morphine because just for the record hd i\ndo not know how to say it they could not come up with any\nlab tests that were conclusive so it was by exclusion and they said\nit was just a peripheral neuropathy and exhaustion but that all\nhappened suddenly when i left my last classified work just coincided\nwith that what it means nobody knows there is some guessing is not\nthat an interesting coincidence hd yes i was\ngoing to say what a coincidence hd but when i said good-bye suddenly and ran away instead of them\ncontrolling me and then i had this shock shocks to my system but the\nthing is about two months ago something in my subconscious i had\njust been waiting patiently basically in bed in this room for three\nor four years in severe pain screaming in pain every day almost and bill experienced pushing me around in a wheelchair one time but i thought just be patient be patient and using the mind i\ngot through that then two\nmonths ago something told me you have to stop this no one else\nis going to wean you off this medicine so i made a spreadsheet\nout and every hour of the day that i was taking it because i lost of\ntrack of how much i was taking it was like 180 milligrams of\nmorphine probably a day it was out of control and so something\nsaid you need to wean yourself off now and i do not\nwish that on anyone to do that but i got\noff slowly and two days approximately two days before all of a\nsudden the zurich conference happened which was a week or so ago i\nhad just weaned myself off and i did not even know about going\nto the conference or anything it just happened so the timing is\nsuch that it is a message to me that yeah now\u2019s the time\nwhen everything starts to really move quickly arthur i have to say actually two months ago i would agree with you\nthat there seemed to be a transition that happened there is\nnothing marked in terms of in the news but there was a sense that\nthings started escalating almost like rolling downhill quicker that\nwas the sense i got and it is interesting that you say that and\nyou did you sort of came awake and started on this sort of move that\nhas put you on stage twice now hd but something something\u2019s happened to where something that\nwas incurable just all of a sudden i am coming back to\nnormal from\nthe point of view of the time acceleration matrix that would have\nbeen the sixth day of the galactic era and in this particular\nwindow which goes from november \u201908 to november \u201909 there are many many sorts of breakthroughs so if\nwe are all feeling that general breakthrough feeling in our\nindividual lives that may be coming from the programming put out by\nthe electromagnetic emanations from the black hole at the center of\nthe galaxy that the mayans called hunab-ku which is the\ncenter of all things i see \nand this to ask in particular of bob dean and arthur because they have\ndealt so much with the area of secrecy  i find myself as one who\ndid not come up in the culture of secrecy but see secrecy as one of\nthe most powerful forces between the open culture and this breakaway\ncivilization that is the secret civilization i have\nfound one of the most consciousness-raising aspects to me is to\nhear of secrets like the teleportation corridors to mars like the\nforward positions on mars the stargates to australia to just begin\nto see all of these secret programs is really\nconsciousness-expanding well exactly information i mean the information itself just to hear\nit like what happened for these people yesterday on stage when you\nwere showing photographs that were really revolutionary because they\nhad been hidden for so long and then to have a person who actually\nwould get up on stage and say i have been to mars and here i\nam  a human that was i think mind-expanding for the audience\nin ways that we will not be able to even trace it is\nhistorical no yeah and obviously i do not even know if it will go out around\nthe world other than because camelot will do our bit right but this is the kind of thing that changes consciousness and one of the\nthings i have to say is that consciousness changes drastically all\nof a sudden it is not like a slow gradual it goes along goes along and from what i understand change actually happens like\nthat hd well even greater and faster than logarithmic is my feeling the\nstep changes hd well i do not know if the step changes or not i do not\nknow if it is like that or not but it digitized or not so\nbob what would you say because you have kind of a little more\npragmatic view  correct me if i am wrong along with the\nspiritual insight  but i think you are seeing these changes\nor you know of things that are coming down the pike that are very\npragmatic for peoples lives well i found secrecy actually to be corrosive to the human soul and\nthat is one of the reasons i have been speaking out so bluntly\nand so loudly over the last few years i noticed\namong the masses of people that i have confronted in conferences\nhere and there an over-riding sense of fear and the secrecy had\nbeen taking its toll on those people they were fearful and they\ndid not believe they had a future they began to think there was\nno future that we are all doomed and one of\nthe reasons i came to this conference\u2014and i gave it a lot of\nthought before i accepted the invitation because i do not like\ntraveling anymore i really do not like flying in airplanes\nanymore i came\nhere to i think alleviate in one small way the secrecy that i had\nobserved that was corrosive to the human soul and i wanted to tell\nthe people in this audience in particular to meet some people like\nalfred here who is a man i have respected and admired for years there is hope in spite of all the darkness in spite of all of the\nfear i would\nlike to say to the people who are interested and listening that there\nis a tomorrow there is a future and they and their children and\ntheir grandchildren and so on the generations yet to come do indeed have a future and it is glorious they have got to\nhold on to that spark of belief they have got to hold on to that\nhope that is\nwhy i quoted tolstoy yesterday when i was speaking when he mentioned\nthat there is something within the human spirit that will prevail and\nendure there is a spark that is burning in the human heart\nthat will not go out no matter how dark the world ever becomes i have\ntried in my small way to convey that to the people and i was so\ngratified at the response that i got they have come up to me literally by the hundreds i mean i say this in no negative intent but they have not let me alone the idea\nthat i said something hopeful in telling them they do have a\ntomorrow they have a future that their children and\ngrandchildren will go to the stars that is the one thing that they\nneed to hold onto there is a future there is a destiny for the\nhuman race in the stars and that is why i am here that is\nwhy i came to add my small two or three cents to this whole thing well i would also say that another thing that you tell them is that they\nhave a right to know oh\ngod they do indeed and i\nthink that just gets a fire burning inside them well i have been furious the fire burning inside of me has erupted\nseveral times and it is dangerous my very nature back when\ni was an infantryman for years and years and years i was not a\ngentle man you pushed my buttons pushed me just a little too far i\nhad the tendency to become somewhat explosive and need i say i had\na tendency to be a little bit dangerous it is\none of the reasons why the black ops people have left me alone because i put the word out that you know i had\nbeen followed in black sedans for a long time at night i had the\nmidnight phone calls i had the black helicopters over my house i put out\nthe word that i was a veteran of two wars i suffered from post\ntraumatic stress syndrome and i could not be trusted emotionally and if you push me a little too far i was an expert marksman and i\ncarried a gun beware you know you mess with me i might end up\nshooting a bunch of you guys and you\nknow the black limousines stopped following me the black\nhelicopters disappeared and the midnight phone calls stopped so the word evidently got out that do not push this old bastard because he can be dangerous you see except you also had white hats behind you oh\nlisten let me tell you honey i have a lot of good friends in high\nplaces and i admitted at this conference things i have never\nadmitted publicly before i do indeed have good friends in high\nplaces and i say that with a little bit of tongue in cheek because\nthese high places they\ngo up and up and up they\ngo out and out and out yeah hd yeah the conference you know for the last few weeks the\nones\u2014whatever they are\u2014the invisible part of the whole\nthing is whatever it is it is very powerful and everyone\nfeels it in the conference in the conferences they are all\nexpressing the same feelings i think at least 98 percent arthur the human race is a work in progress hd yeah and\nwho has been running this experiment hd who is been running yes well but they have given us\nthe freedom too at the same time oh well you know we are an adolescent species we have not quite graduated yet hd we\njust need to learn that we are to work as a family instead of\nfighting each other we\nare not quite adults yet we are troublesome adolescents almost on\nthe edge of being adults but we are going to make it now just to pick up this thread here of secrets and of the\ndeconstruction in making public the secrets yesterday here at the\nsummit the high point of the summit was when after bob spoke and\nrevealed a number of fundamental secrets arthur came on the stage\nspontaneously and also revealed a number of secrets hd not much no but i mean enough in\ncontext it was a revelation that our solar system is inhabited and\nthat earth is part of the functioning social system and that was the\nhigh point of this conference literally the consciousness of the\nconference was raised a\ncomplete change yes and that was acknowledged\u2014right by people people\nacknowledged that i think just as you were coming in it was\nacknowledged so if we take this ending the secrecy i think is\ngoing to be an important function of the consciousness-raising and\nhaving henry and bob come forth in settings like this to reveal\nsecrets which they have lived with for so many years is like a\nbaptism to the people and an empowerment yes because secrets are disempowering that\u2018s right hd bob was a chief soul for me because i spoke to bob privately just\nmomentarily because he had been very busy with all these other\npeople wanting to talk with him and we have some common connections\nthroughout time different places we worked in belgium and such and other places and we\nboth have an army background enlisted and just different places at\ndifferent times but you are like it was a confirmation to\nme you know i finally met someone that you know could kind of\nreinforce my background and  before  i felt alone you know there there you are in good hands you are in good hands this\nexperience for me has been and i say this not with any animosity but this experience has been for me like a catholic going to\nconfession you know they say that confession is good for\nyour soul well speaking bluntly on secrecy and some things that have been covered up\nfor so long i felt an overwhelming wave of relief to have finally\ngone public on a couple of things that i have found to be factual and\ntrue one of them is that deep underground facility outside of las\nvegas where this air force colonel friend of mine went through one\ndoor in nevada and in two minutes he was in pine gap australia now that\nkind of secrecy that technology that allows that to happen stuns\npeople do you mean that we have done that we have got\nthat we can do things like that what have they been keeping from\nus okay well hd i\ndo not like flashing credentials or anything but it is my\ncredentials inside this passport that i stole from my job there\njust happens to be a what do you call it here a\nstamp hd it is so simple can\nyou show it to the camera hd it is a stamp in here that says the bearer is a member of\nthe civilian component as defined by article one of the agreement\nbetween australia and united states forces in australia signed at\ncanberra on may 9 1963 it is just one of the visas you know in this passport this one\u2019s for japan could\nyou show just the front of the passport for the camera it is a\nbrown cover official passport it is not a normal passport and\nwe do want to say for the camera that we have actually been to i cannot say we went inside but to the outside of this person\u2019s\nplace of work one of them i am not going to say where on the\nglobe it was or anything else so do not worry arthur but i\nwill say that we have gotten substantial verification that arthur is\nwho he says he is i\nwould say total verification as far as we are able to and\nit was quite extraordinary hd actually i tried i encouraged them wherever this place was at one\npoint that we traveled i encouraged them to come and meet the\nsecurity people who i knew by first name and they were kind of\nreluctant to do that  at that point that\nwas when we were a little more nervous than we are now what we did\ndo just for the record it was quite fun we accompanied arthur\ninto a bar where the local employees in this establishment would go\nin the evenings and we just sat in a corner and watched all his old\ncolleagues welcome him and say hey we have not seen you for\na while and that was quite fun to do that yeah anyway i am a little concerned here bob that you were\ninterrupted just now because you were telling the story about two\nthings that you felt gave you a great sense of relief when you\ndisclosed them yesterday one of them was the reality of the\nstargate the portal the wormhole the jump room the network so\nthat you could one moment be in area 51 the next moment in pine gap and that prompted arthur to show his australian visa in his was\nit a visa hd/a it is a visa more\nthan that and\nthe second thought please continue because i want to hear this one it is\na matter of interest to me and it always has been that one of the\nlargest national security agency facilities in the world is at pine\ngap but what most people have no understanding of is that\nunderground at pine gap is one of the largest extraterrestrial\nfacilities on the planet our remote viewers have been looking in on\nthat place for years and years and years and what i\nfound terribly amusing  not that there is that much humor in\nthis whole damn thing  but that facility in australia at pine gap\napparently is an extraterrestrial r & r center and people say what do you mean r & r it is a military term\nmeaning rest and relaxation and i\nthought how obvious you know it makes sense aliens are here having to deal with the human race they need rest and\nrelaxation they\nneed some i\ndeal with the human race and i need rest and relaxation which\nis what i am going to get when i go home tomorrow you see but\ni found it amusing out of all the four major facilities on the\nplanet the one in australia is an r & r center for the guys from\nout there arthur have you been there or would you rather fix me with a steely\neye and not answer hd well let us talk about something else well let me say that you were nodding so i thought that was hd i\nwould like to say something  it is just simple  that may be\nslightly off course here but a couple of things one is we are\ntalking about secrets and stuff that a lot of stuff gets classified\n\u201csecret or whatever just because you have got a\nstamp there and you have to do something with it you\nknow it is not they have gone wild with it they have gone mad hd and they stamp everything and it gets filed away and then it has to\nget declassified you know it is just routine to stamp\neverything the\nnavy keeps secrets from the army the army keeps secrets from the air\nforce the fbi keeps secrets from the cia and that all led to 9/11 that is where the secrecy leads to disasters like that hd yeah and the thing is someone needs to interface between all these\ndifferent groups and try and help them to communicate with each other\nwhile respecting their own boundaries and\nare you willing to agree with me that you were one of those people\nthat kind of crossed some of those lines hd/a yes yeah between the various agencies hd/a yes my \u201ccustomers were the whole spectrum which is why you kind of have the level of knowledge about the\noverall big picture as we call it hd that is why i am a big picture person and always a general\nperson and not focused in one area and i did not ask for it believe me it just happened you know you just get a phone call and\nyou just nothing else but a phone call would you like a job yes okay what is it well you just\nhave to be patient and find out it is that kind of thing the other\nthing is at some levels people are saying that the governments \nlike the presidents or whatever or the leaders of the country \nshould release these secrets but they have not had access to\nthis information they get the tours of certain things but it is\nvery limited they get to see blinking lights or whatever like you know and that is as far as it goes as far as i have\never been aware arthur the incident involving president carter some years ago where\nthe president of the united states was told by the director of\ncentral intelligence mr president you do not have a high\nenough security classification for us to tell you all this\ninformation and sir you do not have a need to know now who\nwas the director of central intelligence at that moment george\nherbert walker bush who became president  that is how damn\nbad it is become over the years that is how corrosive\nsecrecy can be not merely to the human soul but to the\nconstitutional system of government it is corrosive as hell and\nit is got to stop and i know you agree with me hd yes the fear thing\u2019s got to stop and we need to alleviate the\nfear for people because all of these things most of the things that\nwe see in the press are just created and planned long ago \nfictitious enemies there are\nenemies but a lot of them are manufactured and some of them are not\neven real okay and there is a long list and they are\nalmost at the end of their list they are at the very end of\ntheir list now the timing so there is nothing else no more\nrabbits to pull out of the hat wait a\nsecond i want to actually say what was your level of\nclearance because his  was cosmic top secret hd/a cosmic top secret because that is a nato classification that is nato and there are levels above that there are two \u201cq clearances above that you\nhad a \u201cq hd/a my\nfirst one was a \u201cq clearance with certain letters special access programs hd yeah but it was \u201cq clearance and that was through the\ndepartment of energy it was the energy research and development\nagency before that it was the atomic energy commission and they\nkeep changing names and you have to keep reprinting the paperwork and\neverything i do not know why but yeah it was a \u201cq clearance and then it went to basically\nfrom there it varied it went up and down from secret up to top\nsecret and over a period of 30 years or more and then it ended up\nwith top secret sci and then top secret with a bunch of letters which\ni still i do not know it does not matter but they\nwere it was basically you are not sure if you cannot say what it was hd yeah it does not matter it does not matter okay i\nwould like to ask\u2014because this is sort of meant to be a\nfuturetalk as it were i fully understand and agree with you\nwhen you talk about the agenda of hyping up fear in order to make\npeople more easily controllable but let us ask the three of\nyou what is worth being concerned about and what is a distraction what\nshould we be focused on as issues for the human race in the next few\nyears and what just is something that is a misdirect like a\nmagician on a stage that we should not even be worried about but they are trying to get us to think that way how can you\nseparate these things out for people this is a really important\nopportunity to make a statement alfred probably is best qualified to answer that well as a general answer to that i would say that anything\nassociated with the current world economy which is an economy based\non the manipulation of the dialectic of enemies is a fundamental\ndistraction so that the entirety of the arms race the entirety of\nthe strategic balance of forces using threat of war is a\ndistraction so do not fall for the war rhetoric right and number two the area that these gentlemen have worked in i think is the cutting edge of human consciousness moving to the\nnext level and that is hd i\nthink it is you  working in the area of human\nconsciousness well no but understanding that an extraterrestrial presence is not\njust an abstraction but rather it is a human race very much\nlike our own hd it is an extension of our family yeah that lives under the surface of mars with whom our\nsecret government now has contact and so we\nhave rights we have inherent rights in the same way i think under\nnatural law which will invoke that which were expressed in the\ndeclaration of independence of the us they were\nexpressed in the us constitution the canadian charter of rights in\nthe universal declaration of human rights various documents in our\nterrestrial human culture and those include rights as sovereign\ncitizens in the universe therefore if our governments are now\nengaged in long term i mean these things go back at least 20 or 30\nyears that is just from people who i have talked to treaties have been made hd i\nhave to remind you that the \u201cgovernments it is\nnot the presidents and down or the queen and down it is\nagencies above that so you cannot blame the governments\nthat we normally call governments no no sure but whether or not they are supra governments they\nare still subject to natural law and universal law and they can be\ncalled before a court empowered under natural law to stand trial for\nwar crimes but we do not want to go that direction the\ndirection that we want to go is to have that secret world become\ntransparent and integrated with our\nworld for which we have an inherent right under natural law bob you have your hand raised you wanted to say something i\nsimply must apologize that i have an appointment i accepted for an\ninterview in about five minutes and i do want to say i am sorry but i will have to take leave of you illustrious personalities here\nfor a while i have to go i am sorry kerry okay it is okay is there anything you want to say before you leave bob about the end of secrecy and the beginning of what is\ncoming next because just as i went to get you today you were\naddressing a group and you said there is going to be in the next\n12 to 18 months some things that people need to prepare for yeah well the gentleman i was talking to was an economist and a bit of a\nbanker and he is been looking at the statistics the data and\nhe is been watching what is been going on in the world\nmarkets and he is troubled by what he sees he is convinced\nthat we are not out of the woods yet on this economic thing he\nasked me what did i honestly think the next year or so had coming i said as\ni said yesterday we are in for some bad times we have not seen\nthe worst of it yet and i hate to tell you that but that is\ntrue we have not seen the worst the other shoe has not dropped yet the only\nthing i can tell you is that within the next year and a half we are\nin for some events on the world scale that is going to make 9/11 pale\nin comparison and that is sad and tragic but to\nleave you with this i must leave you on an up-note for the viewers\nwho will be seeing this and as tolstoy said there is that spark that\nburns deep within each of us it will not go out no matter how dark\nthe world becomes i want to\nleave this with the people who will see this tape there is a\ntomorrow the future of this species is glorious it is in the\nstars and they have got to have hope and not be afraid that is\nall i can say in closing okay thank you bob thank\nyou sweetheart it is\nan honor as always thanks so much bob it is\nalways a pleasure read this gentleman\u2019s book ed note alfred webre exopolitics politics government and law in the\nuniverse]\n\n\n\nabsolutely yes well i have read his work actually i read his\nbook a long time ago before the organization of exopolitics was ever\ncreated this man had the vision of something he is\na true visionary hd yes oh\nyes absolutely i do not think people even realize that that\nthis man is a true futurist actually well if someone would be kind enough and he should be listened to in that way because what he says today is\nnot often not understood but i think it is always the kind of\nthing that years in advance years later they are going to say\nhe was one of the first if not the first in certain areas it is a gift we\nneed our prophets and we need our visionaries and here sits one that is right hd i\njust feel that we need to realize that the rest of our family has\nbeen here visiting us and also slightly off the planet and other\nplaces in there they are interested in watching and they would\nnot have survived as long as they have if they had not gone\nthrough this transition that we are about to go through and so you have to realize that they are friendly and not evil mean\ncreatures out there like in some science fiction movies all\nof them hd anyone that is survived generally anyone\u2019s that survived\nthat is worthwhile i mean the majority otherwise they would\nhave destroyed themselves by now yeah you are not saying that 100% of the extraterrestrials races are\nfriendly hd well they have a different way of they have a different way some\nare service-to-self some are service-to-others service-to-self\nactually means that they what you are what they are because you have not actually met them all right hd no that is impossible you\nwere only exposed to a few hd yeah i mean you are talking about particular groups but the\nthing is that in general i mean there was this type 0 that was\ntalked about and type 1 they would not have survived this\ntype-0-to-type-1 transition if they had not raised their\nconsciousness to some degree in\ngeneral that is the case and then it may have been some\nexceptions but they are such a minority that ed note just google kardashev scale to learn more about the\n\u201ctype 0 theory well actually our government their liaison is often with these\nservice-to-self hd yeah that is right and\nthe evil forces on this planet are not doing it all on their\nown right they did not think up all this stuff on their own we actually humanity is not doing it all on their\nown they are being pushed and prodded by some unseen forces and\nunseen beings it may be a philosophical difference hd it is a philosophical difference that is what it is yeah by\nrecognizing their existence i am not giving them power i am\njust saying we have got to tell the truth here there is evil out\nthere in the universe it does not just stop at the illuminati hd well there is darkness but darkness is for me i view it as\nignorance or ultimately the absence of light it is not an\nopposing force ultimately there is light and then there is\nno light or the interference i was\ntalking about functionality here okay so maybe we can actually even you could talk about alfred what\nwe have been talking about off camera a little bit in terms of\nthere is investigation at the moment going into some of the\nrelationships that are going on behind the scenes with various races yes sure just to keep it down to specific data-points we know what\narthur has said here that he is been to mars we also have\nanother very credible whistleblower who we have talked about who\nin 1980 went to mars twice this\nis andrew basiago yes in the company of a cia officer courtney hunt just to put that on\nthe record through a mars jump room a teleportation jump room from\nel segundo california to one of the sort of bunker-type bases right\nout on the surface of mars and who walked around on the surface of\nmars and who\nin 1971 in the company of his father who was a cia contract officer\ntype met three martian astronauts who were on a liaison and\ncoordination visit at curtis wright air force\nbase this reference is unclear google curtiss-wright is a\nmanufacturer of jet fighter aircraft in the barcelona panel\ndiscussion he called this wright\nafb in new jersey there is no\nlisting for that in nj although there is a mcguire afb in\nwrightstown nj otherwise there is wright-patterson afb in ohio so we know\nthat from at least 1971 there is been a coordinating and\nliaison type function for relationship between the martians and the\nu.s government well from\nwhat i have read the martian civilization is a positive ethical\ncivilization so to counteract our strategy should be as citizens\nto encourage an open strategic alliance between our culture our open\nculture and the martian culture and to make that available\nimmediately at the highest level which is a presidential\nacknowledgement of the existence and relationship with the\ncivilization on mars and\nthat is one of the founding principles of exopolitics exactly yeah but i would like to say that you  are nodding so you are\nkind of recognizing some of the testimony hd yes i never heard of this until now this person or anything and\nit is like ah someone else you know another one yeah hd it\nsounds like a very similar kind of work too very similar but i would like to say  and i am throwing this out here  i am\nfamiliar because i have had some personal contact with some what i know of as anunnaki and that there are some positive anunnaki\nand there are some more negatively oriented you know just like\nthere are humans good and bad you know there are different\nanunnaki and i have\nto say that they are interacting with individuals because i\nhave had some interaction they have made their presence known to me and i know bob is not here to actually talk about this but bob\nhas had his own interaction with anunnaki that he has talked about\nwith us and i think he met them hd well the anunnaki are the exception that i was talking about where\nit is but i really did not have any time to even really\ncommunicate because it is always at a table in a room and it is\njust that was not my function to get to know everyone\nintimately you know right hd but it was similar to what you  were talking about liaison\nand things like that but the table you are talking about is a table surrounded by humans\nnot from this planet right hd yeah well they look like humans in general yes uh huh and\nthis took place at times also on mars right hd/a that is where they all took place for me for me did\nyou ever meet with these people here because as bob was saying he\nmet with a scientist was hd no not here i\nsee i\njust wanted to jump in before the end of the tape to say that we hd i am sorry i made a mistake did i ever meet with them when i\nwas not working yes but that is another story a long time\nago that is another interesting story oh right okay i\njust want to say on record that the person who alfred webre is\ntalking about is andy basiago we have been in touch with him for\n18 months we have not met him personally but i personally\nspoke with him 18 months ago for four hours continuously which is\none of the more extraordinary conversations i have had in my\nlife i have had quite a lot of extraordinary conversations now and i\nlasted about two hours i could not last the whole time to be\nhonest and\nas far as we are able to determine and i am just speaking\nepistemologically here we fully support andy\u2019s story and we\nfully support his own intention to release his story to the world he is only told a tiny part of it so far what is\nreally interesting here is that this dovetails fully with arthur\u2019s\npersonal experiences to do with time travel to do with wormholes to\ndo with the relationship with activity on mars and a whole\ncomplexity here that is very hard to swallow but it is\nextremely important to understand i just\nwanted to add our own support to that this is something else that\nwe will pick up and roll with later because it is way\nbeyond the scope of this conversation okay but i had a conversation today with one of our whistleblowers and he\nactually was talking about the amount of radiation on mars and\nquestioning no he was not he was talking about the radiation in the van allen\nbelts no he actually also talked about the radiation on mars and i was asking\nhim about that and i said that the bases were underground is there\nradiation on mars in excess of what we have for example here on\nearth hd because of what i was doing there i was not even focused on\nthinking about those things i simply was going there for an\nhour\u2014 it sounds strange\u2014for an hour meeting and\nthen i had leave and come here and so for me because of the way\nmy life\u2019s been like this for forever you know nothing was\nunusual i did not even think about things like that whether\nthere was radiation or not those things were just handled by the way\nthe system was set up there or is set up or will be set up i do not\neven know what time period it is now that is another subject well\nyou had physiological reaction to having gone through that process is that right hd right yeah that is another thing because of the kind of like\njetlag kind of thing there is medicine that i was taking that when\ni quit i actually forgot about because everything happened so\nsuddenly when i quit that it was not available any longer but that is\nanother subject again well\nit is tough to be yeah earlier at the start of this\nconversation arthur made a joke and said that he ran away this is\nnot true and i did not want that to be misunderstood it was\nafter a disagreement at work you basically handed in your notice hd/a it\nwas kind of it was not even a disagreement it was it\nwas a conflict hd mm it was just i got very tired because things were\nbecoming more and more restricted in my life to the point of where i\ncould no longer even call my friends or email my friends and instead\nof just trying to sit it out and go through all the massive paperwork\nand things and waiting i just decided you know i would make the\ndecision instead so basically it was a relatively sudden departure hd very sudden rather than being gradually rooted out and that involved your\nsuddenly not taking any more of a particular medication hd which i forgot about because i just i literally left everything\nbehind in my home and just went to another country yes what i am stating here is that the medication you took was\nsomething called \u2018lorenzil ed\nnote could not clarify this word lorenzo\u2019s oil used in\ntreating certain neuropathies lorenzol used in veterinary\nmedicine which if you suddenly withdraw from that sorry that the effects that the lorenzil is\ndesigned to ameliorate is something that is called\ntransdimensional disorder hd/a well this is something that i understand from someone else that i\ndid not know about okay this is another thing that is beyond the scope of this\nconversation it is got to do with a zero time reference that\npeter moon talked about in his first montauk books and so on\nand so forth for the\nbody it is very disorienting when it is going through jump\ngates or jump rooms or whatever it is you want to call these\nthings there is a certain medication that one has to take in\norder to ameliorate that if you suddenly withdraw from that then\nyou are in big trouble and this is one of the things that you\nare up against right and i think that at another point we can talk in more depth\nabout that but for the purposes of this conversation we are\nreally talking about the future of humanity and our interaction with well certainly anunnaki on mars but we\nhave a statement that was made which was actually said to us by\nrobert dean and also some other whistleblowers that the anunnaki are\nrunning things from behind the scenes here on earth and i wonder if\nyou alfred would address that at all or\ntry to right well certainly i have heard that there are various that\nis to take a model of how decisions are made here on earth there\nare various models which have some evidence for them one model\nis a more drastic model than the anunnaki model that\ninvolves\u2014whether or not this is a true model or is the model\nbased on disinformation\u2014involves the existence of a reptilian\nrace in the fourth density that is one more density up from us they\nhave more control over time and that density has been behind the\nphenomenon of alien abductions now there\nare researchers like dr steven greer who believe that all\nabductions the roper poll shows that about two percent of the us\npopulation or about 6 million people have been abducted which is a\nsubstantial number of people and there\nare researchers like dr steven greer who believe that all of the\nabductions are psy-ops and are essentially done by elements of the\nus government as psychological warfare both against the human\npopulation and against the ethical extraterrestrial population to\nstigmatize them whether or\nnot that is true or not there is certainly evidence that both\nsmall gray-looking beings and reptilian beings have been engaged in\nextraterrestrial abductions of a substantial number of people with a\nhigh strangeness theme and these have\nbeen with secret contracts but\nthe fourth-dimensional aspect which is the interdimensional quality\nof this interaction and the fact of these beings is a little\ndifferent i would say than what we interact with in terms of the\nanunnaki\u2014in theory anyway yes yeah this is a different sort of interaction one\nsecond we have got to stop we have got one minute okay then let us do some sort of a summation and i had like you\n to handle that if you would not mind okay well first of all i think that we have established that the\nrelease of secrecy we know empirically from yesterday is a great\nconsciousness-raising event and it will be the deconstruction of\nsecrecy with these great cosmic cycles that will mediate a positive\nhuman future that is great hd/a a\nnatural almost natural event yeah arthur alfred thank you so much for spending so much of your time\nwith us we will continue this conversation later and we have to\ncome to an end here because we have got no more digits and kerry thank you too absolutely thank you so much this has been a fun but enlightening\nevent we have got going here and we are going to continue\nthis conversation for years to come i am sure kerry\ncassidy (kc it is very exciting what is happening because\npeople are connecting all over the planet aaron\nmccollum (am yeah and we are all a part of that who knows where it is going\nto all lead you know eventually people are waking up by the thousands just last night i was talking\nto a gentleman vietnam veteran who had served during the same time\nthat my dad and dave corso had served that is almost i\ndo not know if i told you that my dad and dave served with each\nother yeah i know there is like so many synchronicities\nthat are happening yeah so i mean that is completely bizarre not only are you\nconnected to corso and duncan but your father is connected to corso at least and i mean that in and of itself is like where\ndoes this come from this is so bizarre well as far as my family it is absolute bloodline i mean i\njust recently got some information that i have not yet confirmed but\ni did get some fairly-good information that my grandfather who died\nunder mysterious causes \u2013 no autopsy no funeral \u2013 was a\nhigh military or government member in some aspect of operation\npaperclip who was one of the officials that was assigned in\nrelocating the german nazi scientists no i am not that is well that actually points to why you may have\nended up where you did and my father and my sister right your sister but i have no knowledge of if my older brother was at all i\ndo not think he was but i do fear that he may be drawn in\nbecause of his direct connections with nasa he is climbed up\nthe ranks in the scientific field ah ha he was diagnosed with autism as a kid but his iq was off the charts\nand he is 32 now and he is got his ph.d in astronomical physics\nand nano-technology he works at lamar university he is the\nyoungest novice curator of the houston astronomical society he also\nruns five different observatories and rubs elbows with top nasa\nindividuals okay but i have to say that that indicates that he is part of the\nwhole scene yes i do agree he may not but he may not know it maybe he has not been one of the in terms of some of\nthe ways that you have buried memories etcetera but what you are\ntelling me about his background is just unequivocal \u2013\nespecially actually believe it or not because\nof his autism yes because autism is sort of a marker that they use project thirteen yeah we were talking about that let us talk about that that\u2019ll be really fascinating sure and i think i i do not know if i mentioned to you\nthat i have absolute confirmation that my sister has three children the oldest one baden is a contactee okay absolute yeah but i can tell you what my sister actually witnessed and saw him do we can talk about that another time but it is absolutely amazing okay i did let miriam delicado know and i told her what my sister had\nsaid miriam of course said you\nknow this child needs to be protected be careful who and then i explained to my sister what miriam had said so well that is actually a good thing yeah i am actually going to be getting my sister in contact\nwith miriam cool very good i was not actually sure of how to categorize\nyou like you know i mean not specifically a super-soldier that i\nknow of but maybe  and you know what i am saying i wanted\nyou to categorize yourself sure why do not you just go ahead introduce yourself and basically\nexplain not only who you are briefly like your credentials whatever you would call that absolutely but then also say why you are coming forward at this\ntime okay well my name is aaron egan mccollum i was born september 6 1978 and my well i was in the military i served in the\nunited states coast guard for just roughly ten years i am right\nat the ten-year mark and i was involved in many different black op\nprojects all over the world and even many states-sides i\nhad climbed up the ranks very quickly to where i became a team member\nof a first-of-its-kind unit in the coast guard which is known\npublicly but a lot of the operations they do are most of\nwhat they do are not well-known if\ni had to classify myself it would be that i am third-generation\nproject talent and because of the bloodline i came from i was given\na lot of responsibility and saw a lot of things and even since that\ntime have been called back for specific operations okay i mean to really explain who i am would obviously be good for the\nmore extended interview to really explain that but you know obviously i am coming out today for the first time\nreally publicly to explain about information that i have through\nabsolute reliable contacts \u2013 which i cannot name for their\nsafety \u2013 but involving what is going on in the gulf of\naden in yemen specifically what the global elite are doing and the\nstargate which is absolutely real it is not fantasy it is\nlike kerry what you and i talked about many times things you see\nin movies are put there as a ruse to automatically give this label of\n\u201cfantasy science fiction so people will not dig in\nanymore and they will live in their little world of \u201cit is\nmake-believe okay that is great so you were a member of the coast guard but you also ended up not only working in these teams of special ops\nunits for lack of a better title but you were the leader is not\nthat true yes and project talent has really two sides \u2013 they have the\npeople that never were in the military  civilians but worked\ndirectly in the military even sometimes would wear military\nuniforms but never went to boot camp you know they have their own\nside of that \u2013 duncan for example duncan o\u2019finioan who\nnever really went to boot camp but was absolutely project talent then\nthere are people like me this is where it gets a little complicated i did not choose the branch of service when i was 16 certain\nindividuals \u2013 agents  came to me and told me which branch of\nthe military i was going in and when it would happen so i already\nknew two years before joining so\ni was in the military i got regular military training but at times\nwhen i would be temporarily assigned \u2013 it is called tad temporary assignment duty \u2013 to other units i was not\nactually doing what was known by my commanding officer or whomever at\nthe time i was actually conducting increasing my training\nthat i had started when i was very young so\ni wore two hats there were times when i was petty officer mccollum worked my way up to being chief engineer on ships and doing special\nop rescue drug interdiction whatever and then i had the other hat\nwhere i was just an agent \u2013 no name no denomination of rank nothing so when you say you were doing that are you meaning that you i\ndo not know you would not carry any papers of\nidentification on you absolutely not no id could not even wear a watch nothing okay and on those assignments is that where your sort of\nburied memories are coming back in regard to those assignments honestly it is happening on both sides because as i said it is kind of complicated but let me try to explain as best as\ni can i\ndid a lot of operations where i just wore my coast guard hat and i\nwas petty officer mccollum but i was actually leading \u201cumbrella\noperations that actually had a black operation happening\nunderneath that i was tied to so\nthey would have me close to that so that i would be able to\ninfiltrate and do my other job that was assigned to me so with that because there was such intertwining of operations a lot of it is\nfoggy on both sides okay so let us see because it is really easy for\nme to go down this rabbit-hole  with you and start\nfollowing out your personal remembrances but i think that today\u2019s\ninterview at least for the first part let us\ndo this first let us talk about the gulf of aden and why\nyou are specifically coming forward now before we do a more\nformal interview that has been planned with you for several weeks so\nlet us talk about the most crucial stuff that you want to get\nout there right away and then we can digress from there then we can\nlater decide what to cut in what to cut out okay let me just make this statement i want to make this perfectly\nclear what i am about to let everyone know is based on actual\nfacts articles also contacts \u2013 absolute reliable contacts \u2013\nwho have contacted me within the past month overwhelming amount of\ninformation and this is also based directly on operations that i was\na part of that i have regained some memories back from july of\n2008 until the beginning of march of 2009 operations\ni was a part of absolutely relate directly to what is happening now\nin the gulf of aden okay so what is occurring right now it is actually been going on for\nquite a while but it is just now for whatever reason it is\nleaked out  or they have allowed it to leak out i should say \nthat there has been major military ship movement happening in the\ngulf of aden in a specific location where there are actually hundreds\nof ships right now circling a designated area of open water we are\ntalking russian warships chinese warships japanese warships australia germany uk the list goes on and on even designated\neuropean union ships un ships blackwater which is now xe has a\nship there right now if\nanybody is aware japan has not actually had warships leave their\narea of operation for military-type action in decades same with\nchina china is very much about keeping their warships close so this\nis huge on\ntop of it there is a research company that specifically deals in\ngenetics and dna \u2013 i do not remember the name at this\ntime but kerry when i get that information to you you will have\nthat \u2013 that are specifically doing research in alien human\ndna researching with the genetics that is going on at the same time\nthere as well on\ntop of it there has been a lot of piracy going on there well these\n\u201cpirates the somali pirates and all that \u2013 it is\nabsolutely false flag operations the reason they are doing that\nis to gain fear of you know everyone in that area to keep them\naway it is a very good manageable method to keep just regular\npeople the public away from that area because you know what is\na better way to invoke fear but piracy and terrorism that\ncomes to what happened at fort hood okay before we go there just to clarify because as a\nmember of the coast guard anything that happens on water is\nobviously something that you are quite well versed in absolutely so we want to talk about the source of your information and because\nof that we also want to talk about some of your sort of skills and augmented skills sure okay because this is going to factor in i assume absolutely the other thing is that you are saying that there is genetic\nengineering going on what are you talking about are you\ntalking about on a ship in the middle of the water where the stargate\nis located because i understand that the stargate is over the body\nof water it is and there are actual there is witness testimony\nand there are images of they are calling it an \u201canomaly and a huge magnetic field that is occurring right there at that\nlocation they are calling it an anomaly you know they are giving it labels where the water is actually\nin a swirling motion it is actually causing a huge whirlpool\neffect incredible okay very cool and there have been actual sightings and you can find this online of where they have seen a part of it actually come up but that is\ngone away now as far as the science because they have i\nmean the area of the security zone around it is miles and miles and\nmiles okay but who is in charge of that area well it is i am not quite sure to be honest of who\nexactly is in charge but i can tell you who i would be not surprised\nif it is in charge is obviously members of the global elite the\npowers that be what i think is who was in charge now i think it is\ngoing to change or may have already changed but i have not yet been\nable to get confirmation on it when\nsomething like this occurs is this stargate something that\nhad not been discovered had it been put to rest and there was no\ninterest in it these are possibilities but when something like this\ncomes up certain projects that are still very much happening under\nthe name of \u201cmark\nultra come in and assume command as per direction of certain members of\nthe global elite okay and when you say mark\nultra\nyou are actually saying mk\nultra that it is a different designation i do not understand well mark\n\u2013 mk\n\u2013 is actually used for designation of projects things that is\njust me and my military talk when you are in the military it is\nactually referred to as mark\nultra like\nyou have certain flares that you use like the mark\n134 but you look at it and it says mk\n134 i see so that is just me being military but i will try to say mk\nultra\nfor no no no i tend to start talking using military lingo because i did it for\nso long i understand okay and actually let us talk about how old you\nare and how long you spent in the military i am 31 and i by the books spent just under ten years in the\nmilitary but my involvement has gone on much longer prior and\nafter okay right and again to get back to the genetic engineering you\nsaid this is going on in the area but is it again going on are you saying under the water yes in a base yes okay it is there is an underwater base there i have received\nconfirmation on that okay you are saying that there is an underwater base in the\ngulf of aden yes okay and that is where you think the genetic engineering is\ngoing on absolutely okay and can you it is the same they are doing similar things that\nthey have been doing for decades at underground bases all over\nthe place specifically they have been doing specific types of\ndna research and engineering in a lot of the underwater bases like\nfor example the one that is in the caribbean the one that i\nwas at oh right the one that you are having recovered memories\nabout yes okay yes very fascinating you have shown me some drawings\nwhich are really very very interesting what\nis the source of your intel is it individual is it psychic is it\non the internet is it you know i do not know it is a little bit of everything and i will tell you how\nthis all began okay i had received an email from one of my sources so i cannot disclose\nthis person\u2019s name at this time for their safety and there\nwas a link on it to an article talking about this \u201cseagate that was being expected that there was some strange anomalies\nhappening and there was a lot of warship movement and\nso the investigative side of me decided to look into this so i literally in the past month spent 12 to 18 hours a day not just\nwith my other research but with checking this out making phone\ncalls through some reliable contacts of mine i started gathering\nmore and more information from separate sources then\nwhen i finally saw where it was happening and then realized that now\nthe us along with some other countries have now all of a sudden\ntargeted yemen because of al qaeda which al\nqeada\u2019s nothing but a network that is it al quaeda is\nreally just a network it is not it was all designed but that is a whole other story al quaeda as a\nname is used to invoke fear and gain compliance or needs of whatever\nthe global elite wants at that time yemen\nhas now been picked because of what is happening now at the\nstargate which officially is being said that the stargate opened on\njanuary 5th of this year the\nother information so i started making phone calls then i started\ngetting more emails well wait a minute you are saying the stargate over the gulf\nof aden opened on january 5th of 2010 or 2009 what i know for fact is that it opened up on january 5th of this\nyear 2010 okay now i because i have heard more information about\nthis there is information out there saying that the stargate was\nidentified prior to that absolutely yes okay yes it is been going on things really started getting\non the internet and the news really started a couple months ago okay in december i mean it is now all over i have a whole\nfile which i will get to you of tons of information even stuff on\nyoutube and believe it or the stuff on youtube there is a lot of garbage on youtube but there is certain\nvideos on youtube if you youtube \u201cstargate gulf of aden you will see things that are absolute facts okay based on other people that have gathered information however this stargate in the gulf of aden has been known for quite a\nwhile and a lot of certain countries want to gain want to have their hand in the cookie jar and you know one country\nwants to have more of a hand in the cookie jar than the other\ncountry this\nis why in 2008 i was approached by a captain that worked for the\nunited states marine corp intelligence out of the blue  come up\nto me and said we\nare wanting to recruit you for needs of service again now at this time i was a mess i was having a lot going on i still at\nthat point thought i was really just crazy i was not working i was you know living month-to-month so \u2013 and that is\nexactly how they want you \u2013 and so i volunteered to go back yet after i volunteered to go backthere are parts that are foggy but i had met at camp pendleton with this captain several other\ngentlemen who i am not quite sure who they worked for but\nobviously high up the food chain in the government hierarchy and\nthen two generals one\ngeneral now is actually working on the joint chiefs of staff in\ncharge of all special operations for the united states military are you able to name this person do you want to name this person or\nnot i should probably wait to mention\nthat okay it is not that i am afraid of mentioning it but when we\ndo my more extensive interview i have already decided to release\ncertain names okay but i want to just really focus on the gulf of aden and what is\ngoing on there but i will say that i will be mentioning his name okay just not yet but this is the same general that i have given you\ncopies of the emails yes so that is who i am talking about uh-huh and he told me that in north africa and it is still happening but even back in 2008 there was massive military movement \u2013 us\nmilitary movement in north africa they were gearing up for\nsomething that was one of the assignments that i was going to be\ngoing to to look over some operations there there\nwas also big movement happening in the area of the suez canal which\nis right in that location of the gulf of aden i\nthen started meeting top black op military personnel from all over\nthe world a lot specifically from australia \u2013 australian sas several of these gentlemen were definitely\naustralian but were of middle eastern descent who were being\ntrained to conduct false flag operations in the middle east shortly\nafter this happened there were some false flag events that occurred the big one in mumbai which was absolutely orchestrated through our\ncountry and the uk that i was actually told first-hand information\nby this general and some other people on his staff we\nstarted developing a new team that i was placed in charge of we\nstarted out by doing a lot of states-side training operations with\n local police force specifically the ground-breaking one was\nwith twin palms which twenty-nine palms marine base is close by where the us marine corps was doing this was where they\nstarted doing the security check-points which they now do a lot all\nup and down california a lot you know in southern california south of where we are at right now why\nam i explaining this here\u2019s why the movements that are\nhappening right now from the military there are actually a\nfew secret military bases in north africa right now and in\nyemen and other areas where there are actually more us military personnel\nthan locals in the towns and villages in that area why\nare all these false flag operations happening okay i am\ngetting to the very important point the\nvery important point is these small false flag operations that have\nbeen happening the operations that i dealt with with actually\nconducting false flag operations even having movement of un\nvehicles\nhere in california which i witnessed i saw caravans i talked to\npeople even\nto the point where i was with a team walking around downtown pasadena\njust before new years eve because we had received intel \u2013 which\ni later found out was false \u2013 but they told regular military\npersonnel and local police that a munitions train that was coming\nfrom barstow to camp pendleton after a check in barstow they\nrealised that 5,000 pounds of c-4 explosive was missing off the\ntrain immediately high alert was put in security checkpoints were\nplaced all over the place i\nfound out that this was not true i started doing some of my own\ndigging into finding out why this was all going on shortly\nafter that i was dropped from the project and i had to move out of my\napartment my computer was yet again shut down my cell phone had\nfried my place was broken into when we went to do the police\nreports my roommate and i at the time the police officer did not\nfill out a police report i had surveillance vehicles in front of my\nplace i was just the heat was getting on i actually\nhad to put my stuff in storage and stay on the couch with a friend of\nmine this was a year ago is that right this occurred all in march of last year yes okay now what does this all gear up to this all gears up to based on\nmy experience \u2013 and yes i guess you could say based on some\ncertain psychic ability that i have had i was not necessarily\nborn with but with things that i will get into in the interview it\nwas brought out in me through techniques that they have that project\ntalent has learned to really perfect there is\ngoing to be a major false flag operation happening this year i do not\nexactly know when but i know it is going to happen and there\nare going to be people are going to see a lot more military\npersonnel from other countries the american police force there is\ngoing to be a lot more roadblocks road checks so you are saying a false flag operation here in america or\nare you saying in the gulf of aden because somehow there is a\nlink-up both okay and here\u2019s why it is not just going to be the us this\nis going to be happening in certain countries where it needs to\nhappen it is going to invoke a new war they have been\ntalking  even obama has spoken about this new war on al qaeda in\nyemen why\ndo they do this the same reason that they did it in afghanistan afghanistan was not a war against terrorism it was a war to gain\nmore control in afghanistan because afghanistan does have certain\nentrances to deep underground facilities really that is why russia was after them for ten years okay so you are saying that it is not the poppy the\nopium trade that has people in afghanistan which is what i\nthink most people think absolutely not no it is not the opium however what a lot of\npeople do not know is that the cia still \u2013 since vietnam probably even before that \u2013 have always had black\n\noperations\nof trafficking drugs which was what air america was in vietnam when\nthey were running operations in cambodia and laos right so yes i mean they got to make a profit you know war is not\njust intent war is profit that is why we have you know the\nbankers that are part of the bilderberger group and the bohemian\ngrove and other societies  club of rome and whatnot this\nfalse flag operation is going to invoke a new war on terrorism in\nyemen it is going to happen we are on the brink there is\nmajor military movement there are military training camps being set\nup in yemen right now by our government that are training the yemen\nmilitary to go after the terrorist movement there it is\neven been said on the news and you can find this online that\nthey are making claims that al-qaeda has now built a larger base\nin yemen than exists in afghanistan or pakistan absolute garbage okay so as far as yemen and the gulf of aden how do these work\ntogether in other words the countries bordering the gulf of aden is that why it is being targeted specifically because the\nstargate is over the water oh yes absolutely yemen is ground\nzero okay let us talk about if you know this or you have a theory on what is going on with that stargate do you have any idea all i can give you now is theory but i encourage everybody that is\ngoing to see this to do your own research everything i tell you do\nyour own research because if you do not question you do not\nresearch  you are not learning and you are not waking up based\non my experience with a project that i was a part of that again we\nwill discuss in my full interview i have two theories okay one\ntheory is that there are extraterrestrial beings that no doubt are\nopening or just now really coming about doing something with this\nstargate for a definite purpose now are these extraterrestrials friendly or are they unfriendly it\ncould be two possibilities i do not know yet but i am working on\nfinding out through some very reliable contacts if\nthey are indeed friendly then they have opened it up because we are\ncoming to a time in our world you know 2012 is not the end but i definitely believe that big things are going to be happening and we do have friendly extraterrestrials that want to see us really\nbecome the world we are supposed to be they are not going\nto come in and rescue us but they definitely do things to help\nassist us move along are\nthese the extraterrestrials that decided to open up the stargate and\nif they are is the military and global elite going to do everything\nthey can to prevent this from happening so that they can continue\ntheir agenda the agenda that they have been told they have to\naccomplish within a certain allotted time or \u201ccertain beings are going to step in that is absolute that is the negative agenda that they are trying to roll\nout in other words that certain negative beings negatively-oriented beings in other words service-to-self are\ngoing to step in if the global elite are unable to handle this\nthemselves is that what you are saying absolutely okay very interesting but the other side of it is does the stargate have the\nunfriendly extraterrestrials are they running the show with the\nstargate and the military is there as really the servants because\nthat is really what the global elite are they are\nnot in power people they are\nserving someone else something else or whatever you want to classify them as what you are saying in terms of the gulf of aden are you\nsaying that that stargate could be letting in perhaps in other\nwords it could be incoming it could be outgoing it could be going\nboth ways it is\nboth okay but the build-up militarily there will be not only to have to\ncontrol over this stargate on the one hand but on the other hand to\nmake sure like if it was a negative purpose there could be negative\nets coming through absolutely okay but you know with underwater bases every single underwater base there is at least some presence of extraterrestrials there but i\nwill tell you none of them are friendly right if they are working with the military i think\nit is sort of a no-brainer unfortunately they are really running the show but see they are\nclever they are able to calculate and do things in such a way\nto where the powers that be think that they have control but they\ndo not with\nthis specific underwater base off the coast in the gulf of aden i\ncannot say for fact who is absolutely running the show all i can do\nis give my theory based on my absolute direct experience with bases with being very high up in black projects of project talent knowing\nof and actually assisting in some projects with project stargate and\nanother project which i will be talking about \u2013 i will just\ngo ahead and say it now project\nseagate okay do you feel that what is going on in the gulf of aden are you saying it is adon do you know how to pronounce it actually i believe it is aden but i could be saying it wrong if i\nam please excuse me you know absolutely but are you saying what is going on there may be\npart of an operation which you know of as project seagate no i believe well i do not want to speculate because\ni do not like doing that it is possible but every \ninformation that is been given to me they have labelled it\nas a stargate however people have to be very careful because from my knowledge and from\nthings that i am starting to remember as far as i know there is\nonly one location for project seagate in the entire world could i be\nwrong was there even information that even i was not privy to it is possible but i doubt it and that is about an underwater base that is located in a\npuerto rico area yes it is in the area of puerto rico okay and that is the one you have recovered memories about yes okay have you ever been to the gulf of aden not\nthat i recall okay if i have i do not remember but with all the information everything that i have shared with you on the many times that\nwe have talked and gotten together i probably have maybe if i\nreally sit down and think i probably have regained maybe 40% of my\nmemories why\nthis is happening with me at such a young age i do not know because as you know from your experience with others usually people\nare much older [former super soldiers usually start to regain their\nmemories in their \u201850s and \u201860s not before but through\nsome other contacts i have been told it is a little hard for\nme to swallow but i have been told there is a very specific\nreason why i specifically have been regaining these memories and\nit is not for a bad purpose it is for a good purpose unfortunately\nthere are times when i am still triggered and am taken elsewhere\nto do things as recently as just a couple months ago where i have\ntwo days i cannot account for okay so we have got a stargate in the gulf of aden we have\ngot false flag operations we just had one in which whatever they\ncalled it the \u201cunderwear bomber yeah in which he was basically let on a plane without a passport now is this part of that operation because it seems like it is the\nopening act in a certain sense it is because there has been recent information saying that not\nonly him but the shooter at fort hood now all of a sudden this\ninformation\u2019s coming out that they both had connections with\nterrorists with al-qaeda in yemen okay and it is just popped up within the past week if i remember\nright how convenient so we have a major operation happening in yemen right now is there\nany other extenuating circumstance or any involvement because you\nsaid there\u2019re a lot of ships in that area we have got the\nwater sort of churning under some \u201celectromagnetic\nanomaly going on yes what is going on between the powers that be that you know of in terms of the ships are in you in touch with for example any\ncrew or military personnel in regard to any of that yes i am several okay do you want to talk about even the coast guard it is not just us navy there are us\ncoast guard ships cutters as they are called in the coast\nguard that are there the\npeople that i am talking to that i worked with i worked with on\nthe side of just being regular petty\nofficer mccollum in the coast guard so they are not fully aware but they have contacted me and said aaron something weird is going on and i cannot quite place it and\nthey have never seen anything like it i\nhave a few other friends of mine that are actually in coast guard\nintelligence that have contacted me because they are aware of this\nkind of campaign that i am doing trying you know making\namends for what i was part of so\nthere is big movement there absolute the contacts that i have\nspoken to said that even they when questioned about it they are\ntold that it is strictly for enforcing the anti-piracy and to help\nwith escorting movements through the suez canal because apparently\nthe suez canal is so \u201cbacked\nup with ship transports i\nhave never ever head of there being a problem with \u201cbacked-up ships going through the suez canal  never heard of that so if they are going through the suez canal where would they\nbe headed there is got to be more than one destination for\nthose ships right in theory yes absolutely okay for example well i mean the suez canal is a main shipping canal so they could be just going through bound for other areas right oh yes not\njust all headed for yemen no no not at all because if they did that it would raise too\nmuch suspicion so what they do is they will indeed keep operations\nnormal uh-huh container ships oil ships will still be allowed to go through it it is just the reason they are able to do it so\nwell is because\nthe location of the stargate in the gulf of aden is kind of in the\noff-beaten path it is not actually directly in the channel right but you said that you have information and i do not\nknow if this is public information that there are ships from other\ncountries i think you mentioned japan and china and russia it is public information there are european union ships nato\nships from japan russia germany the uk united states australia and the list goes on and on and\nyes it is public information they are talking about it right\nnow it will be included i have specific information that when i\ngive it to you so that you can look through it on your own it is\nabsolute this is out there get\non your computer google gulf\nof aden google gulf\nof aden stargate google war\non yemen you google any of those\nthings and you will get pages and pages of not just articles but of\nyoutube videos and other pieces of information people\nneed to look at this because with that once you start digging it is\namazing \u2013 not surprising to me \u2013 but it will be amazing\nto people that they will see an article and it is directly tied\nto the label of \u201cfalse flag war we\nare going to be moving massive troops into yemen yemen is the next\nbattleground and it is going to happen this year as far as my\nknowledge and my intuition and everything else that i have\ngathered it is going to happen this year if\nit does not happen this year and if i am wrong good i\nhope\nthat my intuition\u2019s wrong but unfortunately my little gut\nfeeling that i get is 99% right and sometimes i actually get angry\nat myself when i am right about things because i do not\nwant to see these things happen so if the year 2010 goes on and we do not go into a police state or\nwe do not have more false flags in the country if this what\ni believe is going to be a terrible war happening in yemen \u2013 if\nthat does not occur then good but everything that i have\ngathered all my information my contacts have told me otherwise let me ask you this i know you have some interesting abilities\nassociated with water is not that right and i remember that\ndolphins have been used by the military to actually perform feats and\nto actually do operations basically oh\nyes over by saudi arabia and over in that area so i am thinking\nthat with what is going on in the gulf of aden basically there\nhas to be something involving dolphins and possibly other sea\nanimals like whales but i am just curious has there been any\ninformation about the dolphins in that area or anything else the only information that i have for fact which is public\ninformation is that dolphins are being used in all the waters around\nthe middle east for reconnaissance missions they actually have\ndolphins that\u2019re trained that have actual surveillance\nequipment that are attached to them for looking for underwater mines looking for bombs under piers even under ships oil rigs and even\ninformation-gathering they\nhave dolphins that are set up with certain information sound-recording equipment that can actually record sound on land\nthat travels via through the water because sound travels at a much\ngreater distance and can keep its real concentrated frequency much\nlonger underwater than it can in open air do\ni have any information that dolphins are specifically being used in\nthe gulf of aden for whatever attempted purposes with this stargate no i do not but based on my direct work with dolphins with\nproject seagate  i would not be surprised because\ndolphins have been discovered because of their frequencies because\nof other abilities that dolphins have that people are not aware of they discovered a while ago however long \u2013 i know for at least\n20 or maybe even 30 years \u2013 that dolphins directly have because of their frequencies because of what they can do are almost\nused as a medium\nfor travel via the seagate what do you mean by that travel are you talking about time\ntravel i am talking about not just time travel i am talking\nabout traveling to other locations in the universe how\nare dolphins used in that regard it was found that well with the seagate everything is done frequencies are used to actually put you on a molecular level into a\ndifferent state this way your body can actually handle traveling\ngreat distances i know what you mean you mean in other words if humans are put in\ncontact with dolphins and do what is called entraining yes they get aligned on the same frequency as a dolphin and that\nheightens the human awareness such that if you then i am\nextrapolating here because i have swam with dolphins and i know\nthis happened to me i am guessing that is kind of what you\nmean you are absolutely you are on the right track yes one\nof the things that they did that i was a part of was called \u201cpsychic\necho-location what is the word i am\nlooking for this always happens when i start talking about this i am\nsorry sometimes my mind goes blank what\nthey discovered it cannot just be any\nhuman it has to be people that have received certain training mainly people that have some amount of psychic ability they have\nlearned that they could put a person in with these dolphins and\nactually it would cause deep molecular and psychic vibrations that\nhappen where the dolphin is almost used is\nused as a medium and this person\nbecomes a conductor they coexist in this way so that it really\nheightens the senses of the psyche of a person right and so then what would happen i guess we are kind of\ngoing off into the area of speculation although it occurs to me that\nperhaps this is part of your buried memories this\nis the thing the subject that i myself had been working the most\nintensely on the\nwhole thing with the gulf of aden just kind of fell into my lap\nthrough the people i know and then taking it back to the false flag\noperations that i helped orchestrate from july 2008 until the\nbeginning of march 2009 also meeting individuals that were black ops\nthat had been really in a way blackmailed to be in this country to do\nfalse flag operations \u2013 specifically military personnel from\nother countries that were of middle eastern descent they did not\ncare if their family originally came from iraq or pakistan or india it did not matter as long as they had the training and they looked the part is the point and they looked the part yes okay so you were involved in these so-called black false flag\noperations can you describe a false flag operation that you were a\npart of yes i can well one of the false flag operations was where the\n5,000 pounds of c-4 mysteriously\ndisappeared from a munitions train heading to camp pendleton after\nthat the twin palms police force started working with the marine\ncorps and a bunch of military vehicles specifically humvees from\ntheir motor pool were being taken but were not being signed out but\nthen when certain individuals were even asked even when i asked\nabout it do not question us you know twin\npalms was doing random dui checks now if people know this the\nmilitary\nare not allowed to do in-country security check-points dui\ncheck-points anything involved with the police that is what\nthe police are for when\nthat begins to happen that is a pre-emptive strike to implement a\npolice state nationwide absolutely then\nthere was even a bigger military presence that was happening of all\nplaces in pasadena this does not surprise me because pasadena\nis really a trifecta of some very\ndeep\nmilitary operations jet propulsion laboratory (jpl parsons\ncorporation i\nencourage the people who are going to see this look into the history\nof the parsons corporation of pasadena and you will be disgusted\nwith what they have been a part of especially recently with putting\nup certain kinds of \u201chospitals in iraq then of course i can really get into things like jordan maxwell and i\nhave talked about as far as the oto i mean the headquarters of the oto in north america is in pasadena you\nknow sure right so where i live in pasadena i am surrounded by some very awful\nthings so we are talking about a hotbed of the illuminati but we are\nalso talking about a military presence yes in fact specifically on i want to say it was december 28 if i am completely accurate december 28 2008 there was big\nmilitary movement that happened straight downtown pasadena hundreds\nof people witnessed it it never made the news it\nwas a convoy of about 24 vehicles we are talking humvees armored personnel carriers chemical trucks tankers deuce-and-a-halves which are the big huge trucks you usually see\nwith the canopies over them they were all white they were what i have been a part of they\nwere absolute un vehicles yes i was going to say that sounds like un but they did not have un marked on them they did not even\nhave license plates i\nsee they moved through pasadena and moved to a different location on\nthat same day i was in pasadena with a team of plain-clothed not\njust local police but marine corps armed walking the streets in\ncommunication with everybody else while this was happening it was\nnot necessarily see a false flag operation more often than not is a terrorist attack\nlike 9/11 so what was going on with the white caravan was more of a\npreparation is that the idea it was false flag training operation i\nsee in preparation for an actual false flag you know you have war\ngames the military does war games what are war games war games are\ntraining for actual war well this is kind of a war game but it is\na false flag game training operation a drill when we say false flag what we are talking about is something where a terrorist event\nwill happen where actually the terrorist is actually working for an\noperation it is an op and it is conducted by in essence the in-country personnel \u2013 in\nother words united states the government the agencies or the black\ngovernment you know the black secret projects absolutely yes that is the biggest thing that people need to\nunderstand when it is a false flag operation that happens\nin-country the people that are in charge of the black operations\nthat happen with that country they are the ones who have\norchestrated it the bombings that happened in the subways in england\n\u2013 that was an england false flag operation the bombings that\nhappened in spain right what about that false flag absolutely because they all related to what taliban\nand al-qaeda what is truly taliban and al-qaeda it is a\nnetwork\nto allow false flag operations to happen you\nhad mentioned about the people that are used that are aware of it people have to understand that more often than\nnot the people that are used\nhave been mind-controlled they have been taken they have been\nmind-controlled and they are doing it because they are under\nanother state of mind the\none that happened on christmas day he says that he had all of a\nsudden there was reports that he was almost in a trance when it\noccurred and afterward and that he has no recollection who was who are you talking about the gentleman i do not remember his name the actual person the \u201cunderwear bomber is our label for it okay yes there were reports that he was in a trance there is even a\nperson that has come out now a husband and wife that were on the\nplane sure they were on the news saying that they had contacted the fbi because\nthis tall well-dressed wealthy-looking man of indian you know or\npak descent had taken this kid and actually they witnessed him\nsaying he does not have a\npassport but he is from i\nthink it was nigeria and he just said we do this all the time there they\nactually quoted him we do this all\nthe time there and they let him\nthrough dumb you\nknow people need to be aware that that is happening and need to\nquestion why so you yourself you are saying over a year ago you saw\nconvoys and so on going on here in california like a build-up of\nmilitary even here is that correct yes absolutely there is been a huge build-up of military in\nsouthern california do\nyou have any idea why there\u2019re a lot of military bases in california california is\nvery much a key region for military movement i myself have been to two underground bases in california one that is\nin the san diego area and another one that is in the san\nfrancisco bay which is known as a munitions naval weapons base that\nhas a skeleton crew probably a lot of people do not know about\nit it is located in the san francisco bay area and all you can see\nfrom the water are three very large u-shaped piers where trainings go\non there is a lot more to that base than what people see i\nmean they have a huge facility under it it is massive have\nyou been there or were you told about this no i have been there i was there i was there in 2000 2001 and then in the first part of 2002 before i went to become part of\nthe project in the caribbean okay so i guess what i want to do here is to just make sure that\nwe have gotten the information that you wanted to get out there\nspecifically around the gulf of aden okay so just to clarify why i was coming out right now you and i\nspoke this had to get out now because time is of the essence false\nflag operations are going to be happening more not just in the\nunited states but in other countries that are having direct\ninvolvement with the gulf of aden and yemen i\nwill not be surprised if we will see some more bombings or terrorist\nattacks happen in places like in yemen itself it is going to\nhappen in yemen because they need that to get the masses to support\nwhat they are doing so that there is not questioning there is\ngoing to be more false flag operations happening here in this\ncountry it could be as small as more military check-points or they\ncould be as big as another actual attack attempt it is going to\nhappen this\nis all happening to build up justification like what happened with 9/11 they need this justification so people\ndo not question so you continue to be sheep so that they can\nfinally go to war \u2013 the \u201cnew\nwar on terrorism yemen is\nground zero for that why is\nthis happening it is happening because of this stargate that is\njust off the coast of yemen in the gulf of aden why are they doing\nthis i have given my two theories why\nis this happening it is happening because of this stargate\nthat is just off the coast of yemen in the gulf of aden why\nare they doing this i have given my two theories theory one we\nhave friendly extraterrestrials that have opened it for a reason what that reason is yet i do not know but\nthis will not be the last i am working on you know i am\nnot stopping after this i am going to be digging very deep i am\ngoing to be continuing working on this and as i get new information\nyou will be getting the information everything i get kerry is\nthis friendly ets that have opened it up for some reason that could\nbe and it could be that now we have really the major heavy-hitter\ncountries from all over the world who have brought in warships\n\u2013 not cargo ships but warships\n\u2013 by the masses that are literally in this giant circle that\nhave created this perimeter why\nis there scientific research there a\ncertain doctor who attempted suicide \u2013 oh yes that\nworked directly for this research company said the\nworld needs to know and\nall of a sudden unexplainably went crazy and tried to kill herself who worked for a company that the information has gotten out that are\ndoing research on combining alien and human dna okay so now i have to tell you that last night we had contact\nwith a whistleblower and this is just one of those synchronicities\nthat goes on with project camelot today we are having this\ninterview with you this was planned ahead and last night\ninadvertently we got in touch with a whistleblower who has worked for\nthe military \u2013 actually space command \u2013 and were talking\nabout the gulf of aden i\ndid not get all of the information even though we talked for\nlike six hours and we will release that pretty soon that\ninterview he was talking about synthetic\nbeings synthetic robots for all intents and purposes project\ncamelot was in touch with a secret source last night who was talking\nabout synthetic beings and basically i guess some form of\nbiological robot i guess that are being created and some which may be also coming\nhere in other words so\ni am wondering whether or not the gulf of aden is specifically\nconnected with a possible invasion of these synthetic\nbeings is there anything any hook-up that you know of in this regard there has been talk about it amongst me and some other people that i\nam in direct contact with that were a part of multiple projects under\nmk ultra that is something that we have discussed but\nwe were not sure if we really wanted to go public with that just\nyet because you know what i am saying already and what\npeople are going to say is going to invoke fear but fear can build\nstrength and using that fear turn it around to really find out\nwhat is going on okay it is something that we have talked about that indeed is being\nused to bring in synthetic beings that were made off-planet okay now i am just curious now i have got a question for you sure i am going to turn around and ask you a question your contact last night when he was talking about these synthetic\nbeings that are being created on-planet i am curious if he is\nactually referring to the omega program okay he did not name that program he simply was referring to\nboth aspects okay in other words the one which is that the military  in china as\nwell as the us  has been creating these beings and that there is\nalso and it was really interesting and obviously we are\ngoing to be releasing the interview shortly but\nhe was talking about these beings that were created in association on atlantis who were then taken off-planet to another\nplanet and allowed \u201cto develop basically they developed\nthemselves however they are synthetic for all intents and\npurposes they do not have a soul and that they are now for\nsome reason returning to our planet and that they are let us\nsay not happy this\nis the testimony from our witness so it just dovetails in a very\ninteresting way now this person was not able to say whether they\nhad arrived yet i think that he was indicating that they had not but i had have to go back over the transcript to verify that from the information that i have been able to gather my\nintuition says that they are currently arriving because of the huge\nelectromagnetic anomaly that happened specifically on january 5th of\nthis year 2010 okay are you talking about the blue spiral over norway there has been speculation that that blue spiral and other\nspirals have been showing up over norway could that be related to\nthis it could be i do not have enough information to say yes\nor no i would not be surprised though if in some way it has direct\nrelation to it i would not be surprised but i do not want to\nsay absolute okay i will allow people to do their own research and i am going\nto continue to do my research it is\ninteresting what you just mentioned about the soul-less\nbeings because the project\nthat i was mainly a part of the project that i was in reality from\nthe time i was a child was prepared for \u2013 and again we will\nget into that on the next interview \u2013 project seagate project\nseagate was a major project with a huge underground base location and\nthey were working on many different sub-projects project seagate is\nalmost like a sub-version of mk ultra project\nseagate one location that had many sub-projects everything from the\nhuman dolphin super soldier program to an omega program where\nthey were making soul-less beings for remote viewing and actual via\nthe seagate being able to put people \u2013 and yes this is real\npeople \u2013 their astral self their energy their soul into one\nof these robots for covert operations so that if the body gets\nkilled they are able to extract and put it in i\nhave people that i know that this has happened to and we have\nabsolute evidence of this happening so this is a lot like avatar basically you are talking about i am talking about military personnel that basically they are going in\nand \u201cinhabiting these robotic beings yes yeah that is fascinating and also they found that it was easier to have this for traveling for operations through the seagate off-planet off-planet my specific role which i do not want to get into\nright now because you know it is very complicated but i will\nsay that my involvement with project seagate was very high up very\nin depth and i have been to some interesting locations okay do you think that you yourself were doing some of this you\nknow having your \u201cessence in essence go into one of\nthese robotic beings and travel or is your experience different than\nthat i worked with people that did that okay but because of my specific training as far as alterations\nthat were done to my body even as a young child some memories are\ncoming back that even my parents have no recollection of i was able\nto physically be relocated because of what was done to me and\nthere is another person that you are in contact with who is\nable to do the same thing actually was a person i worked with\nclosely that was there okay and this person when the time comes this person will be talking\nto you someone you already talked to will be speaking of the project\nseagate as well okay and you have some unique abilities in terms of water is there\na thought that you yourself were i do not know your dna was\ncombined with for example a dolphin is that possible i am learning new things about myself almost every day with\nme anything is really possible because i have been told some\nthings by reliable sources that have completely blown me away in\nfact i am still having a hard time i mean i accept it i\nknow it is true but it is very hard to deal with because i mean my body has been through a living hell i\nhad some questionable experimentations that were done to me as a\nchild that i absolutely remember well i will just say this the\nreason why i was everything\nbegan for me from the time i was three years old i have an absolute\nmemory that i have been able to get confirmed from family where\ni was taken to a facility by a certain relative \u2013 i will\nmention that when i do my full interview \u2013 who i do not have\ncontact with was not allowed to have contact with when\ni was three years old i was thrown into a pool and they induced me\nto drown i remember laying then on a slab next to this pool throwing up and coughing up water and then seeing these men around\nsaying we have one i\nremember hearing that this is not a dream this is not fantasy this\nis absolute i sometimes still wake up with having night terrors and\nflashbacks about this i have\nalways been able to hold my breath for a long time without having to\ndo the hyperventilating i have always had a very interesting\nrelationship with water i have several people that you know that\ncan absolutely with complete honesty tell you of accounts that\nthey have witnessed of things that have happened to me with\nwater i have\nbeen told not to do any kind of soaking in water because of\nsomething which i will reveal in the next interview which could\nhappen okay so rather than go down that road since this interview is\nabout another matter yes let us go back to the gulf of aden and talk about the false\nflag subject in terms of what specifically if anything has been\nleft out of this interview so far because i think we could wrap this\nup as it is yes i cannot think of any particular areas that we might not have\ncovered but then maybe something might have occurred to you so i\nwant to make sure that we have covered this topic that you have\ngotten out the word about what you think is coming in regard to the\nbuild-up of the military there any other random thoughts or\ninformation pieces of information that you might have that would be\npertinent for the public to be aware of here do not travel to the middle east this year do\nnot travel there do not go\nthere because they do not care about \u201ccollateral damage they proved that with 9/11 they proved that with the oklahoma\nbombing they proved that on december 25th they proved that at fort\nhood they\ndo not care you are an\nexpendable piece of property to the global elite to mark ultra to\ngovernments all around the world i\nhave just a really deep sinking  dark feeling that there is\ngoing to be a lot of death i have been seeing death i have\nbeen having visions of some really horrible scenarios that could\ndefinitely are possible not just in the middle east specifically yemen but in-country do\nyour research everything that i have said in this interview and that\nkerry has said please you know what i am telling you is\nabsolute and i have also specified what was theory what was my\nintuition and i have even labelled some sources where i gathered\ninformation everybody\nthat sees this interview i encourage you to do the same do not\njust take my word for it \u2013 because if you just take my word for\nit you are doing the same as watching tv or watching the movies\nand taking their word for it you\nneed to do the research on your own because that will allow you to\nopen your mind and really give yourself empowerment the\ngreatest gift humanity was ever given was free will and as long as\nyou allow your free will to keep working you will open up to what is\noccurring false\nflags are going to be happening more based on my intuition and my\nintelligence that i have gathered something else big is going to\nhappen in the united states and it is all being done to invoke\nthis \u201cwar on terror in yemen for movement with this\nseagate is\nit going to be to help escort these beings from off-planet or are\nthese friendly beings that are trying to do something we are\nalready in a galactic war that is happening now believe it or\nnot it is happening but with that war there are many\ndifferent battles occurring and we are on the brink of a new battle this is definite i have no doubt about that this is going to be\nanother battle of the galactic war and\nwhat people need to realize is that this planet is a war prize it\nalways has been there is always been conflict for this planet and there are many reasons which i could get into but god you know i would go and on and on is\nthere any other information that i can think of that people need to\nknow about not at this time just know specifically you will find\nthat the major countries that have warships and i want to\nemphasize these are warships everybody \u2013 the united kingdom russia china japan germany nato the un and the now mercenary group xe which is more commonly\nknown as blackwater there are scientific research corporations there\nright now under multi-national contract doing heavy research on\nalien human dna ask\nyourself why ask yourself why was there a doctor that worked for this company that\nunexplainably said the\nearth the people of the world have to be notified it is quoted in an article i found \u2013 and attempted\n\u201csuicide because she knew something she was part of\nsomething she had her own self-awakening and the information she has\nwas so great so overwhelming that she tried to kill herself but\ndid she really try to kill herself or was this a mind-controlled you know attempt to kill herself three\nof the people that i was in contact with that i working with what i\nmyself was helping orchestrate \u2013 false flag events in 2008 and\nin the beginning of 2009 \u2013 unexpectedly disappeared when they\nthemselves became more self-aware and realized what they were doing\nwas wrong i\nhave emails from certain personnel that contacted me and said that\nthey were under house arrest in twenty nine palms right after this \u2013\nand i need to say this because this shows the level of seriousness\nthat this is at \u2013 the person that i was in contact with captain\nscott syner/signer \ni will say his name because he has disappeared the\nplace that he lived at which was not too far from where i was\nliving i went to where he was living because had i lost\ncommunication he had given me a document that actually talks about\nthe preparation a document that was drafted in i believe in 2000 for the agenda going all the way up to 2015 \u2013 a document was\nnever supposed to leave the hands of certain personnel i\nhave 22 pages of that document that i have shared with you kerry this will i am getting off track this person scott\n\u201csyner/signer captain scott \u201csyner/signer who had given me this information started realizing things were\nwrong up and disappeared where\nhe lived i went and talked with the manager they had no they\nwould not tell me oh we had\nno scott\n\u201csyner/signer living here his phone\nbecame disconnected the people that i was in contact with were\ndisappearing left and right i\nmyself became under heavy surveillance even had an attempt on my\nlife yes that did happen last year where on one occasion where i\nfirst thought it was an accident until i got more information well it was not necessarily an attempt on my life but it was what they do\na lot which they are doing with a lot of people i am in\ncontact with it was a scare tactic they are trying to shut me\nup i\njust got absolute confirmation \u2013 and i had like to\nemphasize on that absolute confirmation because that is what i\nhave to have before i will really say in definite the conference\nthat unfortunately is having so many complications the mk ultra mind\ncontrol conference i received an anonymous tip and then through\ncontacts of mine saying that there was going to be \u201can\nattempt on me at the conference because they know that i am\ngetting ready to whistleblow the project that is the absolute most\nsecret-kept undercover project in the world that is project seagate okay so thank you very much aaron mccollum and i assume that you\nwant this video to go out as-is yes in other words we can talk about making it only audio we can talk\nabout possibly putting it into just a transcript a written\ntranscript if you at a later date you decide to do so but at this\nmoment is it your feeling that you want this to go on the internet\nas-is if i am going to really give come out as a credible witness i\nthink that is what you are really calling them now not\nwhistleblower you are using the term witness both okay if i am going to be an actual because this interview\nis going to be followed up with the full interview of how i came to\nbe who i am now and my whole history of the training i got as a kid we will be blowing something wide open that you and i have talked\nabout if i am going to have credibility if i am going to\nhave people really see me they need to see me as a person they need\nto know and\nyes you know i have the tattoos and the earrings but there is\na reason which i will be explaining why i look the way i do now but if i am going to be a legitimate real person and also\nbecause there are people that i am in contact with that i\nnotified i was going to be doing this and you and i talked about\nit to see my face to see that yes i am real i am not some man\nbehind the iron curtain i am not some \u201cdeep throat in a parking garage they need to see it as a whole okay they need to see my face for me eye contact seeing the person is\nvery much you know a lot more empowering okay you know my life has already been threatened and attempts have\nbeen made i have scars from knife wounds from almost getting\nkilled but being who i am i lack the emotion of fear i am\nnot afraid and i need to do this okay thank you very much i also just as a caveat want to say here that is not it true that your connection with\ncamelot and specifically with duncan o\u2019finioan has been\ninstrumental in you getting in touch with some of this yes when a friend of mine first introduced me to project camelot i\nwas very interested because i was starting to have some memories come\nback and then this friend of mine showed me the duncan o\u2019finioan\nand the dave corso interview and it took everything not to break down\nand cry because something there was something i could not remember when\ni saw duncan and i saw dave there was something inside that was just\nfeeding\nme and i could not figure out what and then when duncan and\ndave mentioned st thomas in the us virgin islands my head literally\nhurt it was like i was walking in this hallway and all these doors\nopened and\ni can tell you and i will be saying this in my interview that duncan\nand dave have memory lapses of what happened in st thomas i will be\nable to tell you and i have talked to duncan and dave about\nthis what happened yes dave and duncan and i did in fact do operations together we have\nconfirmed it we know it and even another soon-to-be-whistleblower\nwas directly involved with project seagate with me me\ncontacting you saying this is not a coincidence \u2013 there is\nno such thing as a coincidence this was all the way it was supposed\nto be i owe a big \u201cthank you to you for bringing me to\nthe conference and it was really a reunion between duncan dave and\nthe other friend who i promised i would not say this person\u2019s\nname i will leave that up to this person yeah i wanted to make sure that we gave kind of a \u201cthank you or a nod of the head to duncan o\u2019finioan and dave corso yes absolutely and you know dave and i we see each other all the\ntime i have been regularly going to his place duncan\u2019s\nbeen really busy but there were a couple times after the conference\nwhen i was able to speak with him and actually see him when he was in\nla filming the manchurian\ncandidate by\nthe way i want to pitch that if you have not\nseen what is titled as the\nmanchurian candidate\nepisode of conspiracy theory\nwith jesse ventura it is\non trutv you can find it on youtube now \u2013 an absolute must it\nwas so well done i was so impressed with how well it was done that is\nmy little pitch for that just helping out my friends dave and duncan\nwho are also working hard to get the word out okay thank you very much today is january 9th 2010 yes it is it is dave corso is birthday today there you go i sent him a birthday card okay thank you very much thank you bill ryan (br this is bill ryan and kerry cassidy\n                  from project camelot it is friday the 27th of march 2009 different time zones in different parts of the world i am in europe kerry is in los angeles brian is in ecuador wade you are in seattle is that right?wade frazier (wf yes we are delighted wade to be talking with\n                  you wade frazier like brian o\u2019leary who we had the\n                  great pleasure of meeting and talking with at length in ecuador\n                  back in january is a veteran free-energy activist brian o\u2019leary was in the astronaut\n                  program and is himself a veteran free-energy activist he is\n                  done a lot to investigate phenomena on the fringes of mainstream\n                  science is a very accomplished speaker has been everywhere\n                  and knows everyone and we are very proud to feature him as\n                  one of the witnesses on our site but not so many people will have heard of wade frazier his\n                  website which is called ahealedplanet.net has 1,200 pages it is encyclopedic in its scope and it tells\n                  wade\u2019s story of a non-stop running skirmish with the\n                  whole issue of free energy and you are taking to heart this as a cause which is very much what brian o\u2019leary has\n                  done some people think that free energy is all about an inventor\n                  sitting in a garage or a basement with a bunch of electronics\n                  and magnets and getting a little machine to work that will\n                  light up a light bulb and everyone thinks gee whiz this\n                  is a neat little device here it is an alternative to\n                  having a windmill in my garden and this is very far from the point because free energy is\n                  at the hub of so many issues that are connected with how our\n                  planet is run and controlled that it really is one of the\n                  very central places to start wade and what he has to say about free energy needs to be\n                  heard it is a very very important story and what i am\n                  looking forward to here in the next hour or so is a conversation\n                  primarily with wade and brian o\u2019leary to talk about\n                  why free energy is something that we should care about why\n                  it should be politicized why it affects every corner of our\n                  lives and for those people who have ventured into this area with\n                  practical intentions it is proved to be quite a dangerous\n                  path for them to tread because they can really interfere with\n                  the agendas of others this is really what i would like to talk about it is not\n                  going to be a technical conversation it is going to be\n                  a conversation about the paradigm shift that is necessary\n                  for free energy to be ushered into this world in the 21st century and i wonder wade what it is about free energy that has\n                  made this virtually your life mission why is it so important why have you devoted so much of your time and your soul to\n                  this cause thank you bill as you know it\n                  was a very long story that began when i was a child i am\n                  over fifty now but my journey in the alternative energy area\n                  began when\n                  i was a teenager i was groomed to be a scientist from a very\n                  young age and when i was sixteen years old one of my professional\n                  mentors had invented an engine which was considered the best\n                  for powering an automobile it created quite a lot of interest\n                  from the federal government in the united states in fact they spent millions of dollars developing and analyzing it but also it never went anywhere and in fact the inventor was told that if he thought his engine was\n                  going to make the internal combustion engine obsolete he should\n                  start making his funeral plans and so this was my\n                  introduction to this whole area back in 1974 that was when you were still a teenager wade is\n                  that right yes i was sixteen\n                  years old and at that time i had the dream of changing the\n                  energy paradigm in this world at age sixteen i had no idea\n                  what i could do about it but it was a dream that i had and\n                  so then i continued my science studies and so i think very importantly in fact most of the people that i am aware of in this field we\n                  generally have some kind of\n                  mystical orientation because we have\n                  had some experiences that opened our paradigm to beyond\n                  the \u201cscientistic paradigm and saw a broader picture fellow travelers\n                  in this field i think most of them would say that that was\n                  probably key.anyway so i then went to college and had\n                  some strange experiences that\n                  changed my studies from chemistry to accounting then i got\n                  out of school and went to work in los angeles and did\n                  my cpa thing after several years of kind of being frustrated\n                  in the corporate world i had another very strange set of events capped\n                  with a paranormal experience that led\n                  me directly into a company up here in seattle this was 1986 they were marketing\n                  energy conservation equipment here in seattle basically it is\n                  a heating system that would save\n                  80% of your heating costs i joined the company as it was actually being bludgeoned out\n                  of existence by the energy interests up here in the northwest because of that childhood dream and my background even though\n                  the company was destroyed the founder could not get rid\n                  of me so i ended up following him across\n                  the country to boston and then that is when we started pursuing free energy if you will the technology that we were pursuing was actually marrying\n                  the heat pump that dennis lee the guy in seattle was marketing with the engine that my old mentor developed we were\n                  actually trying to marry those together then we ended up in\n                  ventura california which is where i was raised and then\n                  started making a lot of noise i mean my partner dennis  he is\n                  the indiana jones of alternative energy he is\n                  been behind bars survived murder attempts currently\n                  the federal trade\n                  commission is trying to shut him down.anyway in ventura then we really got the attention of the\n                  people who i will say manage the energy paradigm on this planet we received an offer in boston and then we received another\n                  one in california my partner was offered\n                  a billion dollars                  to fold up the operation and go away the offer was made by\n                  a cia man who said he represented european interests a month after my partner declined their offer he found himself\n                  in jail with a million-dollar bail the\n                  man who arrested him got promoted to be in charge of the jail a couple weeks later and got an award and all these\n                  kinds of things so anyway it was quite a radicalizing experience\n                  for me because they eventually took their masks off in ventura\n                  to me and admitted\n                  to my face that their job was to take us out so they did\n                  their best and it was actually a pretty good job they wrecked\n                  many many lives i ended up leaving ventura back in 1990 after a couple of\n                  us essentially sprung dennis from\n                  jail he ended up only spending\n                  two years behind bars and then i spent the next twelve years\n                  trying to figure out what i had just lived through and realized\n                  that probably everything i thought i knew was\n                  probably not true.and so then the result of those twelve years\n                  of research i\n                  do not know i probably read a quarter-million pages of\n                  material or something like that and again turned it into\n                  the\n                  website that i have today.and yes bill it is a thing that the\n                  energy situation humanity rides on top of it in fact humanity\n                  always has life on earth the human journey it is\n                  all the energy situation is\n                  at the root of all that and so an energy scarcity has defined the\n                  human journey even though i live in the richest most powerful\n                  nation in history and the average american consumes eighty\n                  times the calories that go into their diets we are\n                  still a scarcity-based society the increasing level of energy use that the\n                  west has enjoyed has definitely transformed our society in\n                  many ways it took a lot of old social structures and made\n                  them obsolete slavery began with early civilization\n                  and ended with early industrialization the liberation of women all these things there is an essentially economic basis\n                  that underlies that which is powered by energy and what we found was that there is people who manage\n                  the energy situation on a global basis it can be debated who\n                  they are what their motives are could they just be protecting\n                  their market i tend to believe that they are maintaining their\n                  global power structure that is my conclusion and again i have run into fellow travelers since then brian among them who we have generally come to about\n                  the same vicinity of understanding the problem the issues and the opportunities and what is possible so i am aware and i think brian is and most of us are\n                  aware that there are energy technologies you know the guy\n                  tinkering around in his garage if he ever really comes up\n                  with something then he does attract the attention of the global\n                  controllers i will call them and in fact people who poke their nose into this pretty deeply again it is risky business there is a lot of people\n                  who have had their lives wrecked or they are dead or\n                  they are silenced somehow but some people like steven\n                    greer who is a warrior \n                  or dennis  he ended up banging on the front door of the white\n                  house and all this kind of stuff and eventually greer interacted\n                  with at least a faction of this global control organization they admitted that they have paid\n                  one hundred billion dollars                  in \u201cquiet\n                  money over the last couple generations to put the lid\n                  on \u201cdisruptive technologies and i would say that free energy is probably\n                  at the top of that list although my understanding is from\n                  people very close to me who have witnessed some of these\n                  things that antigravity the people that you interview on\n                  your project camelot site a lot of the things that i hear\n                  them say are things that i have\n                  also had experience of and so we kind of come to the same general vicinity but\n                  my message and i think brian\u2019s essentially there is\n                  a big picture to see here and the energy situation is really\n                  the keystone of the thing and as far as why free energy and what it can bring about\n                  seems to be so unimaginable in our societies i do not\n                  know how conspiratorial that is been because eventually after all my years of study and experience etcetera and being\n                  introduced to bucky fuller\u2019s work i came to realize\n                  what these ideologies have that\n                  keep us from seeing the big picture they all are scarcity-based and so they all\n                  have a scarcity-based component to them and in fact they also\n                  have a component where if you give your allegiance to this\n                  certain ideology then it feeds you and so you are very\n                  reluctant to give up your belief system.so free energy etcetera there can be an abundance-based\n                  foundation of our society which the human journey\u2019s never\n                  seen that so it is something that really it is\n                  difficult to wrap your head around it takes a long time to\n                  do that and what i found is you have to really lay\n                  aside all your conditioning of your scarcity-based\n                  kinds of ideologies like\n                  capitalism or nationalism or a lot of the scientism the\n                  rationalist materialist paradigm all these things are very\n                  subtly scarcity-based some are less subtle than\n                  others but in the end that is what they have all in common.and so what free energy ends up doing is you can actually\n                  replace that scarcity assumption with\n                  an abundance assumption it is a shift that would be we have never seen\n                  it before i mean in fact all of the epochal so-called\n                  revolutions of the human journey  the super-predator\n                  revolution or the domestication revolution or the industrialization\n                  revolution                   essentially humanity was able to tap into another energy\n                  source and control a bunch more energy in a way that was able\n                  to free up people beyond survival.i live in the united states and it is been a pretty comfortable\n                  existence to be an american even though most americans today\n                  are wondering if they are going\n                  to lose their job next week walking some of our listeners through\n                  this world that you describe as a thought experiment supposing\n                  there was a little black box in every house and in every truck or in every plane there is a slightly larger black box and every power station has a really big black box and this\n                  black box just gave as much output as one needed at zero cost\n                  once you have actually got this thing there how does the\n                  world change i had love to ask brian\u2019s view.brian o\u2019leary (b\u2019ol hi hello\n                  everybody it is good to be talking with you again bill and to hear you are reading wade because certainly both\n                  wade and i have had parallel pathways of discovery of stepping\n                  outside of the box of mainstream thinking it is taken\n                  quite a while and it can be a very painful process it is\n                  a process that the general public now is i think beginning\n                  to awaken to.in answer to your question bill imagine a world where we\n                  have these say little 10-kilowatt power-packs that you can\n                  put in your circuit-breaker box or under the hood of your car the world would change overnight let us say we made two\n                  or three billion of these now i am not saying that i necessarily advocate doing\n                  this under the system we now have and that of course then\n                  begs the question of political and economic control and some\n                  of the reasons why this technology has been so suppressed and believe me wade and i have personally had many many experiences\n                  around that since our own awareness became more pronounced so what i see happening is that this new world  as long\n                  as the governments of the world and the corporations of the\n                  world change systemicallyand that is been my plea gosh on my website i just posted a\n                    letter to obama it was\n                  an open appeal basically to please address the systemic changes\n                  we need so that we can usher in some of these new technologies\n                  in a very benign way that we can do things\n                  differently that we do not want dick\n                  cheney running this one too nor do we want the current us\n                  government such as it is to be running this one obviously these technologies are a big threat\n                  to vested interests whether you are a scientist and\n                  we know that the whole history of science is just riddled with\n                  denial of new developments whether it was during the copernican\n                  revolution the time of keppler galileo the wright\n                  brothers                   their initial flight the reporter that reported it was\n                  far from its position and scientific\n                  american about a year later ran an editorial a scathing\n                  editorial denying\n                  that aviation ever existed - because it\n                  was not reported!historically we can look at the structure of\n                  scientific revolutions  thomas\n                  kuhn\u2019s book  and i know wade is acutely aware\n                  of this we have both been studying this kind of thing\n                  about paradigm shifts many times and it is now happening\n                  once again in spades and as wade points out the energy picture\n                  in our time is probably more important than anything else and so we have to kind of break this down and look at this\n                  from a sociologist\u2019s point of view as who is\n                  doing the suppressing and why are they doing the suppressing and\n                  what you find when you really look at these things  because\n                  wade and i have already seen for ourselves numerous demonstrations\n                  of proof-of-concept of the new energy technologies  why\n                  are they so violently suppressed?so you have this unwitting alliance among scientists corporatists governments even progressives - people who otherwise might\n                  want to embrace this possibility - even the progressives are\n                  not looking at these things and that of course is the saddest\n                  part.and so in our own way wade and i kind of in parallel discovered\n                  that there is a whole process it is an emotional process it is a sociological one where people who are trying\n                  to protect their own interests seem to dig their heels in even\n                  more than they otherwise would have in order to protect their\n                  careers or their vested interests.so the scientists most\n                  of the mainstream scientific community just like in the early\n                  days of aviation are denying the possibility of free energy\n                  and will go out of their way to debunk it and there certainly\n                  have been many many examples of that.but it is not only the scientists it is the government\n                  itself it is the progressives it is the people\n                  that call themselves environmentalists are obviously not radical\n                  enough they are thinking of things like solar energy\n                  and wind energy but you know one of the disappointments i came to back\n                  in the \u201970s when i was working for morris udall he\n                  was a congressman who was running for president and he wanted\n                  to develop renewable clean energy and in those days my only\n                  horizon of awareness was solar wind the so-called traditional\n                  renewables but then a later study if you look at the cost and benefits you find that solar and wind is materials-intensive it is\n                  land-intensive it is capital-intensive we are talking\n                  about tens of trillions of dollars to invest in a whole new\n                  system of solar or wind to provide the world with its power and that is just not going to fly especially in today\u2019s\n                  economic climate we need to be smarter about this we need to look into the\n                  21st century towards those technologies that will truly give\n                  us a clean energy society and my own discovery during the 1980s and \u201990s i\n                  traveled the world and visited some of the best and brightest\n                  inventors and wrote some books about this and i finally came\n                  to my ah-ha that indeed this could change the world\n                  if it were implemented properly so this whole new energy activism that wade\n                  and i share is a great enthusiasm but there is also this\n                  undercurrent of sadness about how our planet and almost all\n                  of nature is being destroyed by a cancerous humanity that\n                  is not awakening to these possibilities which could then buy\n                  us a little time while we really try to reform our culture\n                  and do the systemic changes that we really need to do brian thank you that is a wonderfully articulate\n                  presentation of the problem and presentation of the challenge i had like to ask wade if you could tell the second-hand\n                  story of this free energy pioneer whose credibility you feel\n                  is total who you said was shown by \u201cthe powers that\n                  be what technology they actually have and it was explained\n                  to him why they are keeping this secret this is a story\n                  that people need to hear yes during my years i came in contact\n                  with quite an interesting group of people and anyway one\n                  of my very close associates yes was shown  in a very remote\n                  setting  some\n                  of the technologies that exist today on earth antigravity free energy these technologies exist you know and for me i put my jigsaw puzzle together\n                  of the picture at least that i see from all of this and the\n                  people who have really been out there  i mean it is\n                  not for the timid  and the people who have survived\n                  anyway being out there and come back to tell what they have\n                  experienced and the picture that i see is that the people\n                  who are calling the shots on the planet like calling\n                  the shots on the planet and they do not want to give\n                  that up energy independence would truly make everybody\n                  independent and so we are so energy dependent we are so\n                  dependent on other people providing us our energy if we actually\n                  had our own source of it the very centralized very steeply\n                  hierarchical political-economic-social systems we have in the\n                  world would become obsolete for instance this friend of mine who had this demonstration the people who are currently addicted to the power that they\n                  have over the planet they will do whatever it takes to maintain\n                  it and the technologies they have are way beyond\n                  what is on the market today i mean it is star trek kind\n                  of stuff wade did your friend tell you what it was exactly\n                  that he was shown and was he given an explanation for why\n                  he was being shown this and i am assuming he must have\n                  been given an explanation why this technology was being withheld\n                  and not being released kerry it might be better to help wade if you could take\n                  the lead on this because wade is having trouble understanding\n                  my gentleman\u2019s accent here.kerry cassidy (kc i know that is ok i am sorry about that wade what he wants to know and\n                  i had love to know myself what exactly was the technology\n                  that your friend was shown at least free\n                    energy and at least antigravity ok those were two of the technologies that were definitely\n                  shown off ok and i almost did not want\n                  to know a whole lot more because the knowledge can be considered\n                  dangerous to have but there was a host of exotic technologies\n                  that were demonstrated free energy and antigravity probably\n                  most prominently you say that technology was demonstrated in other words did they see craft for example this was in an underground setting so they definitely did not want to fly anything around or at least the antigravity demonstration was not\n                  something like a mothership it was pretty small but anyway i am saying these technologies were demonstrated and again the people who demonstrated them admitted that they\n                  do not have the freedom to essentially come above-board and\n                  bring this stuff to the world and they also though said\n                  that they would like to bring it out but it is not safe ok why was your friend shown this why him oh why was my friend ok so my fr boy this is where i have to be kind of careful the circles i run\n                  around in  i have run around in i am kind of semi-retired\n                  from this stuff  but again they go banging on the front\n                  door of the white house go banging on the front door of the\n                  pentagon go banging on the front door of some corporations sometimes you get to meet the wizard this person was high\n                  profile at the time they were banging on the doors they were\n                  stirring things up and they got a show ok can you tell us what aspect of or do you know what part of the military was involved in showing this stuff this person does not even know who\n                  it was who showed it to him fascinating ok very interesting this was a very very secure operation so secure and where was the underground base located can\n                  you say the state i am not sure i believe it was in\n                  the united states this person does not know where they were\n                  taken there blindfolded and they get to take the blindfold\n                  off and they are underground\n                  someplace and there is these people demonstrating something and they are talking to you and they know who you are and they are saying hey we have got some things to show you it was that kind of\n                  setting ok until this person wants to talk publicly\n                  about it i am not going to reveal too much information about\n                  it stuff that people have disclosed publicly then i will so again dennis\n                    got a billion-dollar offer when i was with dennis we had some very interesting interactions\n                  with some of these groups and again as i recall bill calls\n                  them white-hats and black-hats and we had\n                  encounters with both groups ok and we would get periodically contacted by\n                  the white-hat group it was very cryptic all of a\n                  sudden you are\n                  working in the office late one night and you get a telephone\n                  call and it is like keep up the good work this\n                  kind of thing and so you are kind of wondering what\n                  was that all about so anyway all i know is that during my days with dennis we were extremely high profile and in fact i have written because it is a little safer to disclose it now but when\n                  i was with him in \u201996 97 we were subjected to\n                  an extremely elaborate sting operation\n                  that was trying to entrap us and again it was people who said they were going to give\n                  us a bunch of money to make things happen about a year later i heard tom\n                    bearden talking about a very\n                  similar situation saying how yes they say they are\n                  going to come and give you all this money but it is dirty\n                  money and as soon as you sign for the money they whisk you\n                  off to prison and it was not until actually it was last fall that\n                  i started writing about the\n                  financial meltdown and my interactions\n                  with some of these players and i came to slowly realize that\n                  we were being set up and in fact in almost the same kind of\n                  operation that bearden described it was extremely elaborate with penthouses in manhattan and sovereign nations being\n                  involved it was very elaborate and i really do not know what was real and what was fabricated i do not know how many people were duped and how many were in on it i will\n                  probably never know but i do know that we were being set up whoever all these\n                  people are again the federal trade commission right now is\n                  trying to shut down dennis i have not been involved with\n                  dennis since the \u201990s but they are trying to shut\n                  him down right now and when they clobbered\n                    us in ventura when they clobbered\n                  him in washington or they were about to clobber\n                  us in boston it is usually the government that is wielding the\n                  public club but they are just taking orders i\n                  mean they are not the guys really in charge of the operation and that is when dennis\n                  got the billion-dollar offer to fold up his tents and go away that was not delivered oh yes cia representing european\n                  interests or at\n                  least that is what they said so that is there is\n                  your private/government quasi- kind of thing going on and\n                  then again the government comes and shuts you down the sting operation that we were being subjected to at the\n                  same time that i get a letter from our phone company that the\n                  justice department had subpoenaed\n                  our phone records and gagged\n                  them for six months from notifying us that they had etcetera you are kind of wondering who all is involved and how many different ways they are coming at you and\n                  i saw that in seattle in \u201986 i saw that in ventura we were subject to kind of a whole new level of the game when\n                  i was with dennis back in \u201996 97 so anyway again why do you think that was though was it because\n                  you guys were so close why that we got the attention that we did yes oh because my partner he again when i met him in \u201986 he was selling equipment he\n                  was actually making an economic\n                  impact in the marketplace and again the closer you get to the market the greater the\n                  resistance is going to be so yes a guy tinkering in his garage they\n                  just they leave him they will keep tabs on him but\n                  they are\n                  going to pretty much leave him alone unless he really comes\n                  up with something then he will get some attention but we had a national effort going on he sold\n                    quite a few millions of dollars of his heat pump and\n                    he was trying to carpet puget sound with these heat pumps\n                    which was one calculation was the local electric company\n                    was going to lose something like twenty billion dollars in\n                    revenues over the next twenty years wade when you say the white-hats were trying to\n                  show you this technology and they would call you up late at\n                  night and encourage you do you know anything more about who\n                  the white-hats were and did your friend actually ever have\n                  any kind of meetings with those white-hats were they military i will say this i described\n                  the underground situation and we would get called and then\n                  we actually did get the suave fa\u00e7ade of the black-hats offering us a billion dollars and then i am\n                  sure they were behind what happened to us in ventura i do\n                  listen and again for instance steven greer has interacted\n                  quite a bit in these arenas and the picture that he has developed\n                  of what he is\n                  seen i pretty much think he is right and so in fact when they mentioned the hundred\n                  billion dollars in \u201cquiet money i was going well that makes perfect sense because just in my\n                  journey i have\n                  run into quite a few inventors who had been bought out threatened killed this kind of thing and when i heard that a hundred\n                  billion dollars in quiet money it made perfect sense brian\u2019s friend john\n                    rappoport he said there is\n                  eight economic cartels on the planet that kind of divvied up\n                  the world economy i will not deny that because i have\n                  seen similar activities taking place in medicine media these kinds of things wade can you talk about the white-hats though i will talk about the white-hats so it is\n                  interesting i have one person i encountered once who was abducted drugged and put into an insane asylum and when they were\n                  in this asylum  and it was a way to keep him quiet  there\n                  were kind of white-hat people in the asylum who were kind of\n                  looking out for him i am sure you guys have encountered\n                  this in some of the things i have read on your site where\n                  this kind of thing goes on so there are these kinds of surreptitious\n                  white-hat people and i do not know exactly how that structure\n                  operates but my understanding is that the let us say\n                  two- to three-hundred people who are kind of the policy-makers\n                  for the world economy i would say that thirty years ago\n                  it was a very small fraction of them like five percent or\n                  maybe just a few here and there who were kind of not really\n                  sure they liked the program any longer.several years ago i\n                    heard greer say that it is almost\n                  50/50 now to where the so-called white-hats i do not\n                  know how white those hats are but i believe that there is\n                  a definite fracture in that structure to where a lot of them\n                  realize that we are going to turn the earth into a cinder\n                  on the path we are going and so they do not like\n                  that program they have grandchildren and this kind of thing and so i think there has been a fracturing happen because\n                  the game\u2019s getting pretty scary for them and so they\n                  do not want it so i do not know how white those\n                  hats are but i believe that what my friend was shown in the\n                  underground setting was some faction of that disenchanted half that is my perception so you believe that these people basically took\n                  care of your operation in ventura they closed it down in\n                  essence right oh yes in fact when\n                    they raided us i was twenty-nine young and na\u00efve and thirteen armed deputies come in and kick us out of the\n                    buildings and then they ransack our chief researcher\u2019s\n                    office strip it out to the walls and then did not\n                    start the so-called \u201cofficial\n                    search for\n                  several hours later said they never were in the room except\n                  the researcher and one of our machinists who was out behind\n                  the building were able to actually see into the building and\n                  watch them ransacking the office so this was when they first\n                  raided us so at that moment we realized that this had nothing to do\n                  with trying to see if we are committing crimes or not i mean they were committing the crimes right off the bat anyway at that moment we realized that i mean i realized\n                  that definitely this had nothing to do with trying to protect\n                  the public or anything like that and then for me though it was a thing of it was not\n                  until i was on the witness stand  and dennis was in leg irons\n                  and with a million-dollar bail  and the prosecution is actually\n                  making faces at\n                  me as i am on the witness stand i mean in kind of a stalinist show-trial atmosphere in fact\n                  the guy making faces at me was the guy who was in charge of\n                  the jail that dennis was in and then at that moment that was essentially\n                  my radicalizing moment where a twelve-year journey of gradual\n                  disillusionment etcetera sort of came to a head for me and\n                  i kind of ah-ha that\n                  was my big ah-ha moment sitting\n                  on the witness stand where they are making faces at me\n                  as i am testifying wade i had like to go over to brian what\n                  you can say about how the world needs to change in order to\n                  accept free energy and whether you think that there is\n                  actually any hope at the moment for that happening bo\u2019l very good question kerry and i wish i\n                  could answer it simply because who knows what the powers that\n                  be are doing in quiet session right now.what i can say is that the concepts are there there is\n                  a very clear possibility we can develop these things and there\n                  are many of us who have been advocating it for a long time it seems like the political climate has not really changed on the other hand the public is getting really\n                  pissed off at what is happening certainly the economic\n                  demise we are\n                  all going through right now is perhaps a metaphor or symbol an archetype for what could happen in the energy area that\n                  even the protestors  the bill mckibbens of the world\n                  or the so-called free thinkers about peak oil or global warming whether it is james hansen or richard\n                  heinberg or all\n                  of these other people who have advocated radical change \n                  still do not embrace the possibility of free energy.so even though some of us wade and i and a number of others have been attempting to educate some of these more visible\n                  progressive people about the possibility of free energy and i have even had conversations with congressman dennis\n                  kucinich about it and he did carefully listen he did acknowledge\n                  it he did want to introduce legislation to support the research\n                  and development on it and make this publicly more visible even though all of these things have been acknowledged and\n                  communicated the fact remains that the consensus among the\n                  so-called progressives is still a complete denial about the\n                  possibility of free energy and that to me was the most astounding discovery i made\n                  that  having done almost two decades ago my world travels\n                  to find out for myself as a scientist that indeed these concepts\n                  are very real there are many many different parallel technologies any one or some of which could do the trick  but whenever\n                  it comes time for actual development of it that is when\n                  people step in and that discovery which i made on my own and wade has made\n                  it on his own and many many others  tom bearden  many many other people on the cutting edge of these technologies\n                  have all come to believe that the world is definitely controlled\n                  by a cabal of people who do not want this to happen that is the saddest part of it is the\n                  lack of awareness among most people in the world that this\n                  is even a possibility and if i were to develop policy my\n                  own thinking is that well we should leave no stone unturned in our quest for clean energy and creating a world of abundance but somehow that is perceived by the powers that be as\n                  a threat to them just like significant economic reform  or economic\n                  revolution is probably a better word now for the situation\n                  we are in  has been vehemently opposed by wall\n                  street and the people in charge they are digging their\n                  heels in so we are involved in this incredible storyline that is\n                  probably more sensational than anything that could be dreamt\n                  up in hollywood and unfortunately most people have been very\n                  slow to awaken to this possibility.because in a sense the politically palatable\n                  way of presenting this material is that simply this\n                  is a possibility let us\n                  look at it let us see how we might be able to implement\n                  it let us see what kind of world we can have with this\n                  implementation these are the questions that need\n                  to be asked now ok thank you brian wade what do you think about\n                  the potential for free energy now after you have been\n                  through all that you have been through politically i\n                  mean what do you think the chances of actually turning the\n                  tide as you say using white-hats who are obviously you know not happy with the situation and there are many people behind  they are\n                  very unhappy with the current situation they are looking\n                  for news ways of doing things do you think that the climate\n                  is such that perhaps this new energy technology can now come\n                  through i think you are kind of getting to the nub\n                  of the matter here in my work  and again the things\n                  i realized and this was through my radicalizing experiences  there is\n                  the black-hats and the white-hats and they are definitely\n                  doing their thing at the same time they are really not\n                  very powerful i mean you are talking maybe\n                  a few thousand people out of six billion people and\n                  they have definitely a lot of tricks in their bag but when the dust settled in ventura i realized\n                  that if i had\n                  a hundred dennis's free energy would have been\n                    easy it would have been we had have been unstoppable but there is\n                  only a few of him on the planet so the thing is for me is that it is not about the\n                  white- and black-hats it is about us the great unwashed\n                  masses we can make it happen but we cannot make it happen\n                  if we cannot even imagine that it can be better that is the message that i am trying\n                  to get across i am trying to make\n                  free energy thinkable i am trying\n                  to make it to where to bring it out of either as bill said some guy tinkering in his garage or some star trek fantasy\n                  or something to say now these things i know they are real i know they are possible and\n                  the outcome of that i have been living with this for many years i can\n                    barely imagine what it could do the whole course of the human journey\n                  could change very dramatically and so i think if enough people\n                  kind of understood that it would not take very many people\n                  to just even think about this stuff to maybe create enough\n                  momentum to go in the direction of helping it happen because what happens is the people pursuing\n                  these things they are out there alone in the desert i mean that is\n                  the problem they are out there alone in the desert and\n                  they are so vulnerable again most people just\n                  take the money so the hundred billion dollars in quiet\n                  money i bet that worked ninety-five percent of the time they just took the money and it was over and when you do not take the money what do\n                  you think happens to the people when they do not take\n                  the money then they\n                start playing rough ok and again most people take the\n                  money in fact again bearden i heard him talk eleven years ago or so about this and so\n                  what they do is it is a\n                  carrot and stick they are very subtle i mean it is a very how\n                  to say it if they came right out in the open and it was very\n                  obvious what they were doing too many people would catch on so it is a very sophisticated very subtle kind of way\n                  they operate you know it took me over ten years after\n                  the sting operation almost nabbed us for me to kind of figure out\n                  what was going on and so it is very subtle and bearden talks about how they operate again what i have\n                  seen i think he is right and also what i have seen though is that one provocateur set loose in the midst of a\n                  hundred average people provocateur\n                  prevails particularly\n                  when you start having the pressure of like we were experiencing\n                  in ventura and seattle so what is it do you think that they are\n                  still after you so to speak in that they are still messing\n                  with you and the people that you know that are working in this\n                  area oh god oh sure do you think they are still messing with you i do not know of an issue of\n                  a greater magnitude than the energy issue that humanity\u2019s\n                  facing right now oh my god we are having wars in asia killing millions of people over the hydrocarbons the issue is so multi-faceted it is so immense that oh yes this is being very carefully managed and again these \u201cdisruptive technologies are\n                  very carefully monitored what my friend saw was somehow\n                  somebody snuck something out the back door and demonstrated\n                  some of the stuff you know it is very tightly controlled\n                  to make sure that \u201cdisruptive technologies particularly\n                  like free energy do not appear on the scene you know it is possible that it is\n                  going to come down to the white-hats and black-hats it is\n                  possible that is how it is going to be determined part of me hopes that is not how it happens part of me\n                  hopes that enough of us make\n                  enough noise in a positive way but if enough people understood the potential understood\n                  what was possible and understood how important they could\n                  be to help making that happen by just simply\n                  lending their awareness to the issue that is what i am trying\n                  to find out i think that that is a way that it can happen thank you wade that is great brian i would\n                  like to ask you because it sounds like you and wade are actually\n                  on the same page with this as far as what is necessary\n                  next is to get the word out in such a way\n                  that people become educated so that the mass of people can\n                  actually maybe turn the tide is that your feeling?bo\u2019l absolutely kerry and indeed wade and i\n                  are on the same page and it is not very many of us on\n                  this planet that are on the same page right now so it is\n                  kind of a lonely process but to the degree that we can at\n                  least instill in enough people the fact that these things are\n                  very real that the concepts have been shown to exist that\n                  their development requires an r & d effort like anything\n                  else that involves new technologies this certainly has happened\n                  in information technology quite abundantly so wade what are you doing now i mean i know\n                  you have kind of run a very hard race it sounds like trying to get this stuff out there are you in touch with some\n                  people now that are actually working on free energy that are\n                  being interfered with yes yes there is some i lived\n                  through it on my journey i saw enough people like me going\n                  through similar things brian is in contact with many more\n                  of those kind of people than i am i am aware of quite\n                  a few i am\n                  in touch with some and i love them these\n                  people who are trying to do these things but they\n                  do not have any support your effort is to drum up the support yes in other words you have kind of changed your\n                  tactic from encouraging or working on free energy directly\n                  yourself to trying to drum up a grassroots effort in the end if i can have a part\n                  in helping people just imagine that it is possible for\n                  me i am\n                  done if i achieve that i will have achieved something\n                  that i would be happy to achieve that would be enough for\n                  me to just help enough people understand that these things\n                  are feasible and what can come out of that yes that is where i have been since\n                  1989 when i sprung dennis from jail i was pretty much done and again he got me to rejoin with him back in \u201996 97 i was only there a few months but it was a thing where i have not\n                  really been actively involved in doing the indiana jones thing\n                  for again twenty years and again three years was that was enough it was enough\n                  for one life for me of doing that in fact i do not know\n                  how dennis does it some of these people i do not know\n                  how they do it i really do not know when you say you do not know how they do\n                    it you are saying you do not know how they\n                    deal with the opposition that they get is that what you\n                    mean no-no i mean so here\u2019s dennis survived a number of murder attempts been behind bars twice\n                  for two years almost\n                  got killed inside there turned down a\n                  billion-dollar offer to go away there is now again there is going\n                  to be some tv show is going to smear him on sunday the\n                  ftc\u2019s trying\n                  to shut him down and he is still at\n                  it that is the part where i am going how do\n                  you still keep doing it so that is the thing that for me boggles my mind.or again there is other people i mean greer\u2019s\n                  one of them they go through immense hardships and they come\n                  back for more and for me that is like brian brian\u2019s\n                    been doing this for a long time and i have been doing it but i do not play at their\n                  level i tried to do something\n                  different and again the ride was too rough for me the ride\n                  was too rough and i said i cannot afford to\n                  do that anymore anyway that is kind of what\n                  i was saying is that i do not know how some of these\n                  people are able to do what they do are you familiar with ralph\n                    ring ralph ring is\n                  a free energy person from way back back in the \u201960s the fbi came in and closed him down when he was working with\n                  otis carr so i wondered if perhaps you knew about him he is\n                  quite elderly no he is actually now back at it he is back\n                  at work trying to get funding and i have nothing but admiration so do you give advice to these people john hutchison for example do you know him yes i have interacted with mr hutchison oh man it is hard because i can that they are\n                  trying to do it is so honorable and wonderful and the odds\n                  against them are so immense i mean they are so immense in\n                  today\u2019s world and so it is like a mouse\n                  trying to take on an elephant and you are seeing\n                  this and my heart goes out to these people for this and again i am trying to say i am\n                    trying to get you some help by helping more people to become\n                    aware of what is going on because most of\n                    these people they just end up as brian said this is a\n                    lonely lonely journey they cannot do it by themselves my opinion is that they do not have a\n                  prayer by themselves they are too vulnerable it is\n                  easy to take them out we had hundreds and hundreds of\n                  people involved when they took us out it takes more it takes\n                  more people\n                  with the right\n                  stuff do you think times have changed sufficiently to\n                  where there might be a chance for these people because of\n                  the downturn in the economy and the discontent that is\n                  out there yes i believe that the big shifts will happen quite\n                  often when the current structure kind of crumbles right so\n                  it does bring opportunities yes these are very pregnant times i believe that we are\n                  in the middle of quite a transition whether we make it or\n                  not is probably still an open question but i think we are\n                  in this transitory time when the old ways are starting to crumble so yes there is lots of opportunity and again what brian is trying to do what\n                  i am trying\n                  to do is to give extremely positive solutions that are right\n                  there it would not take much to turn\n                  this into heaven on earth it really would not take\n                  that much to do that definitely there is more people\n                  who are pulling up from the dream let us say that we are\n                  all kind of fed and trying to see differently so yes i think\n                  there is\n                  opportunity well it is wonderful to hear you say that and obviously after all that you have been through it is\n                  really extraordinary that you can still hold that perspective well thank you and it has not been easy ok well i did want to ask you what was\n                  your paranormal event or series of events that pushed you\n                  on this road ok i was this science\n                  prodigy as a young child and again my\n                  dad used to work in mission control and so i mean my dad left houston just before brian moved\n                  there and so we have had these kind of parallel anyhow i was this kind of space brat scientist\n                  kid and as a teenager i started getting introduced to some\n                  of the pretty mundane inventions that were compared to what is\n                  on the market truly revolutionary and again that is when i started kind\n                  of \u201cgetting\n                  it like when i was twelve years old my\n                  father reversed the hardening of his arteries by adopting\n                  a live-food diet something that medicine at that time said\n                  was impossible so i was introduced to the impossible happening\n                  at age twelve and again i had my mystical awakening at age\n                  sixteen ok but what is your mystical awakening what\n                  do you mean when you say your mystical awakening ok that is a good question brian and i had the same exercise that both initiated our mystical\n                  awakening which was back then it was called the edgar\n                  cayce method today they call it remote viewing but i\n                  was in a silva\n                  mind control class in 1974 brian\n                  took lifespring in\n                  1979 and at the end of this training you are\n                  given the name age sex and city and then i was able to describe well actually more dramatically i had somebody in mind and\n                  i gave this information to somebody else and they were able\n                  to describe to me  in\n                  startling detail  this person that was the beginning of my mystical awakening was seeing people perform psychically very dramatically and\n                  then it was my turn and i was able to do the same thing and\n                  brian when he took lifespring he had the same experience in fact those classes were very popular in the \u201970s millions of people took them with similar results anyway for me that turned something on in\n                  me and i think it opened up my intuitive side but again to\n                  me it was the beginning of my mystical awakening and most\n                  of my fellow travelers in this field they usually had some\n                  kind of experience like that when they were in their late teens\n                  or early twenties greer had a\n                  near-death experience at seventeen one of my fellow travelers had a kundalini\n                  experience as a college physics student and then developed\n                  a free energy prototype that was immediately seized and again he was in his early twenties this is a very common\n                  age when this kind of thing happened and my professional mentor that invented\n                    the engine and stuff you know world\u2019s best engine comes\n                  to him at a stoplight where does that come from so anyway i just had enough of those kinds of experiences\n                  and then had some of my own experiences that really opened\n                  my eyes what about ufos did you have any kind of encounter\n                  experiences yes i have encountered lots\n                  of people who have\n                  seen craft some people have had \u201cclose encounters\n                  of the third kind but i just heard a lot of this stuff it was on my list of things to do was to go out and see one and then anyway one of my fellow free energy travelers\n                  said he would go down near mount adams and watch ufos fly over a couple of my aerospace buddies from boeing organized a trip\n                  there in 2005 for us to go watch ufos and we got our show and i went\n                  back the next two years in a row and i\n                  got a show every year oh you went to trout lake ed note james gilliland's ranch in washington state]\u00a0 yes absolutely we went as well and we have seen\n                  james gilliland\u2019s you know we have been up to his\n                  ranch and saw the craft our first night there james said let\n                    me see if i can get one to do something and a\n                    minute later one did very dramatically in fact there\n                    was an air force captain standing next to me and again a couple of boeing guys and it blew their doors off that is\n                    for sure so anyway yes i have experienced that bill is telling me that when your friend had his\n                  machine seized that they knew it was there even though it\n                  was a secret do you think they remote-viewed they had their\n                  remote viewers tap into the situation you know i do not know on that\n                  one i just know that actually it\n                  got seized twice i am going wow they must have pretty good surveillance to do that kind of\n                  stuff and then again in my circles somebody who\n                  should know said oh yes they can tell when anybody in\n                  the planet taps into that field and i am like oh ok i do not know exactly how they are able to surveil\n                  and to do this but they did he was a physics student and he\n                  actually goes into this physics lab and he bread-boards a prototype\n                  that works i think he was using the radiant effect which\n                  is one of the free energy ways out there he had a men-in-black experience\n                  a few hours later seized the prototype he was kind of booted\n                  out onto the sidewalk kind of going what the hell was\n                  that all about he was probably you know twenty-one\n                  or something and anyway so he is like they cannot\n                  do that so he goes and rents out some warehouse space\n                  somewhere very secretly under an assumed name so he is\n                  doing this secretly  they will never find out and he\n                  ends up making it happen again and a few hours later men-in-black\n                  experience again that is fascinating i am sure they surveil\n                  the entire planet for free energy devices and i imagine they\n                  are able to pick them up in the matrix when i asked somebody how did\n                    they do that they said well they\n                    have satellite technology that can surveil the whole planet anybody taps into this zpe field they know it so\n                    i am\n                    like oh ok and my understanding is that if you ever tap\n                  into that kind of stuff it depends on who you are and where\n                  you are as far as what their response will be so if you are\n                  a group of a hundred people they are going\n                  to have to be very careful about how they do it but if you are\n                  just a kid in a lab they just send in the team it is\n                  easy to take care of it with just one person do you think that their tactics have changed over\n                  the years i would imagine in your\n                  journey you just hear these various things happening and you are\n                  kinda going whoa look at that yes so what they used to let us say thirty\n                  years ago or so they were extremely violent i mean i have\n                  heard of stuff like a guy\u2019s whole family being murdered and then they burn the house down and then bulldoze it and this kind of stuff has happened dennis has been high profile a number of times in ventura\n                  we were pretty high profile and we were approached once i am going to say probably thirty years\n                  ago there was this guy who was he\n                  had built a windmill farm out in the southwest he was\n                  rich he was like apparently worth four hundred million dollars and he invested thirty-five million dollars of his own money\n                  into this windmill farm he was making electricity he was\n                  trying to sell it to electric companies and then he was working\n                  late at the office one night and he gets a call and pretty\n                  much the caller made it very clear that you\n                  have a choice you can either leave your facility there never\n                  return or your family will be dead by dawn what is it\n                  going to be wow and again when you are worth\n                  four hundred million dollars they cannot what kind\n                  of carrot can you give to somebody worth four hundred million\n                  dollars so they just come right out with the stick anyway this guy he goes well i took out my calculator and i banged in the numbers and that\n                  was nine percent of my net worth and i just decided it are not\n                  worth it he\n                  just packed his briefcase and leaves and never returned and again he showed up at our office in a\n                  limo just before they dropped the sledgehammer on us and he\n                  said i wish you guys the best but you have no\n                  idea what you are\n                  up against so i kind of found out what he was talking\n                  about but i am saying back then they used to\n                  do stuff like that my understanding is that it is a more\n                  subtle game that takes place now what do you think brian do you think it is\n                  more subtle nowadays?bo\u2019l oh very good question kerry yes i think\n                  it is a bit more subtle now i know i have had my\n                  own experiences and have matched it with others that go back\n                  to the early \u201990s  and very unpleasant experiences\n                  where i refused to be recruited into something and there was\n                  some recrimination and some threats that i will not go into\n                  in detail but i think if i compare my story with that of others and\n                  look at the history of all of this although i cannot\n                  say for sure because like my dear friend and late colleague gene mallove was brutally murdered in \u201904 what do you think tipped it over the edge with mallove do you think that he was too close to something or that he\n                  simply could not be brought under their wing in a certain\n                  way why do you think they attacked him so brutally?bo\u2019l he was a true hero he is one of my\n                  heroes of my lifetime i just tremendously respected his work\n                  because he was the chief science writer for mit and in 1989\n                  fleischmann and pons two chemists from the university of utah claimed to have discovered cold fusion which is a process\n                  that has now been replicated many many times over by many\n                  competent scientists but at that time 1989 their claim was\n                  viciously refuted by some of the nuclear physicists at mit well mallove was going to support them in debunking the cold\n                  fusion discovery and found instead that the mit scientists\n                  were not only falsely debunking the evidence but actually committing\n                  fraud and so he had the courage to stand up to these scientists and to mit whereupon he was summarily dismissed went on his own and founded infinite energy magazine which i think is a wonderful magazine particularly in those\n                  days when he was editor he was a real advocate of new energy probably the most articulate\n                  one because he was very rigorous scientifically he would not\n                  make any claims that could not be substantiated and so obviously from the point of view of the world controllers he was a threat and he was also in the process of getting\n                  funding for creating a research and development laboratory he had been shuttling back and forth to washington just before\n                  his murder which although the cover story of the murder was\n                  that it was a robbery the real story i would say almost\n                  anybody that knew him including his family are just you\n                  know beside themselves in trying to find out how this happened who did it and so forth and so there is an example of\n                  a real hero who was sacrificed do you think that he was sacrificed\n                  because he was \u201cone\n                  of them originally and because he was so articulate\n                  and getting so close i mean in the sense that he worked for\n                  mit he was not just some guy with an invention\n                  in his garage he actually came out of a very sophisticated\n                  background.bo\u2019l yes i would imagine yes because he was\n                  one of the shakers and movers of the field and he pulled no\n                  punches he also had a very very well-grounded scientific\n                  and philosophical perspective on the issues raised by the possibility\n                  of free energy and so he just this obviously disturbed\n                  the powers that be.another example was stefan marinov who was a professor of\n                  physics at the university of graz in austria and also just\n                  a few years ago - i forgot the exact year but it was early\n                  this century - he \u201cjumped from the tenth story\n                  of his library building at the university\n                  of graz well he was europe\u2019s premier free energy advocate i had met him many times talked with him he seemed to\n                  be a very jolly and very very well-adjusted person who was\n                  doing really good breakthrough work even had a motor that\n                  he had invented which he demonstrated and quite widely showed so it is just another example there are just so many\n                  examples of suppression.john hutchison a dear friend of mine we have toured\n                  japan together and he is had thank god he is still\n                  alive he is just a brilliant man who has managed to develop\n                  dramatic demonstrations of antigravity technology with a fantastic\n                  intuition and just a very fine person well the us military\n                  has given him no end of problems so you look at these stories one\n                  after another and you have to come to the conclusion that\n                  pretty consistently right up until this moment these developments\n                  have been suppressed and is it getting any better i do not\n                  know i know we have\n                  had these discussions kerry and you have found some signs\n                  that it is and i would love to think that it is i think that the people that really need to awaken here as\n                  wade often suggests that the only people that seem to awaken\n                  and are able to peel the free\n                  energy onion are people that\n                  are already somewhat sentient and have had experiences in a\n                  number of different avenues  not only science or not\n                  only being a political progressive  but that people\n                  somehow need to go through many many different experiences\n                  in a variety of ways before they can even embrace the possibility\n                  that this could happen i know for me i had to go out and visit the\n                  inventors the researchers myself and make it a\n                  personal project to see these proofs-of-concept and most people\n                  do not\n                  have that luxury and so i feel for them when somebody like\n                  me even though i have all these good credentials even so most people that call themselves \u201cpragmatists will\n                  kind of roll their eyes or glaze and they will not even\n                  look at the possibility that this could be but then if we understand the history of science if we understand the famous bertrand russell quote the\n                  resistance to a new idea increases as the square of its importance and if we are talking about totally revamping the economy totally revamping our energy system totally revamping our\n                  whole industrial and financial culture which is digging its\n                  heels in alongside the military industrial complex you are\n                  talking about a revolution here an energy-solution revolution which to the degree that people can become educated to this\n                  possibility and to acknowledge it  or at least lean\n                  into it  to even ask the simple question ok i\n                  do not believe this is real or possible but let us\n                  do a mind exercise and let us say well ok let us\n                  say if somebody comes along with a technology that could truly\n                  do this do we want to have it and i should think that the clear answer would\n                  be \"yes as\n                  long as we can develop social and political systems to birth\n                  this whole new paradigm shift and then we have a fighting\n                  chance i think and wade i am sure you had totally\n                  agree that we have a fighting chance to save the planet to\n                  respect the earth and nature i think that is wonderful brian i think that you know that is a very good point and very well said\n                  by you and bill wants me to say that most\n                  great scientists are mystics well that is what i mean if you look at\n                  the guys who physics rides on their shoulders today einstein and heisenberg and schr\u00f6dinger and these guys they\n                  all to one degree or another had\n                  a mystical orientation and again in my own experience with my tesla-like\n                  mentor and again the other people my fellow travelers again\n                  on the cutting edge of this free energy stuff they pretty\n                  much all have a mystical orientation to one degree or another i mean some are way out there some visit other dimensions and some are kind of like oh i think i have\n                  past lives so there is\n                  a spectrum there but essentially they are not materialists i mean none of them are materialists wade were you familiar with mallove and his work somewhat i was in contact with mallove and again the new\n                  energy movement was organizing its conference that\n                  it had in 2004 and mallove was the first speaker lined up and anyway we lined him up and a week after that which was\n                  a very strange week very emotional it was a bizarre week anyway he gets murdered as i am being emailed from one\n                  of the participants saying i think we are under\n                  attack anyway i had that encounter with mallove.again the thing with mallove with me and\n                  his work was that i read something he wrote less than a year\n                  before he died where he was saying there is\n                  three main ways to go after free energy and one of them\n                  was the\n                  exact thing we were trying in ventura which was\n                  taking atmospheric heat and being able to get useful work out\n                  of it and again i was interested in what he had to say about\n                  that so i contacted him and we were going to have some more\n                  exchanges and then he died right ok i am sorry you\n                  had spoken about that earlier on and i had forgotten about\n                  that association well this is really very very impressive both you guys\n                  have got such a great background in all of this and the fact\n                  that you have taken even your technical skills and turned\n                  them into public speaking to where you would actually bring\n                  the knowledge to the people and make what is in essence a grassroots\n                  movement is really brilliant you know it is really the\n                  best approach i would think so i just want to say thank you\n                  from all of us for doing that both you wade frazier and\n                  brian o\u2019leary have you guys known each other for a long time well i\n                    met brian in \u201991 when i had\n                  to pick him up at the airport for a new science conference we drove right past wright-patterson air force base and made\n                  jokes about hangar 18 the blue room and stuff and so that is\n                  when i met brian and then when he published miracle in\n                  the void in \u201996 i bought about thirty-five copies\n                  of it anyway brian it quickly became evident to me i had\n                  already been through my salad days on the free energy front\n                  when i met brian and it became very clear that brian was hip we have had interactions\n                  over the years and he invited\n                  me to be on the new\n                  energy movement board back in 2003 we are\n                  living on different continents right now but as much as i\n                  can help brian do what he does i am honored to do it.bo\u2019l i feel the same way about\n                  you wade that some of your insight and our journeys in parallel\n                  and together that our interactions have been very important\n                  and that there is\n                  been a lot of learning on my part from you in giving this\n                  a broader context than just vetting this or that new energy\n                  concept which people still ask me for they still come to\n                  me and say hey what do you think of this what do you\n                  think of the air car what do you think of this sonoluminescence\n                  device i have now gone away from that i am more interested in combining politics with these\n                  concepts and also observing because i think wade you helped\n                  radicalize me in some of the writings of noam\n                  chomsky and ed herman and so forth that these are the kinds of guys that\n                  you would think could awaken to this but no they have not and the same thing goes for richard heinberg so we keep trying to tell them well what about the possibility of this and now and then\n                    you will get this scathing\n                    response from the likes of heinberg or mike\n                    ruppert or\n                    some other people that you had think would embrace these\n                    things but somehow are still very much in denial so it is a lonely road and the people\n                  that i think will be taking the lead here will be brand new\n                  people people that will come forward and maybe this economic\n                  crisis is now providing a greater opportunity - it is\n                  my hope anyway - for us to develop a new kind of leadership systemically and really start from scratch and to make a\n                  change we can believe in  not let it just be empty\n                  slogans that respond to wall street and the military-industrial\n                  complex which in turn responds to higher forces that are somehow\n                  suppressing these possibilities thank you brian that is wonderful what i had\n                  like to do is bring back bill here but i also wanted to ask\n                  both of you if you could respond to what is it you think when\n                  you see things like you know the space shuttle and the space\n                  station and the way they are dealing with this what in\n                  essence is sending a tin can up into the air you know i mean what do you think when you see that they are creating\n                  a new technology supposedly planning to go to mars and moon there is a new mission underway but what do you think\n                  about the technology they are going to use to do these\n                  things the fact that they are still relying on this old\n                  technology?bo\u2019l you know for one i think that we are\n                  living in the past we are living with past models that\n                  are falling apart ever since the space shuttle was first proposed\n                  i realized that nasa was falling apart because it was a bureaucratic\n                  invention kind of a miasma and the same with the space station sort of a \u201ctinker-toys designed\n                  by aerospace companies to line their pockets right now the technologies we are using\n                  are drastically old they are simply not worthwhile they are\n                  in the past it is expensive it pollutes the atmosphere the shuttle itself contributes to the hole in the ozone layer every launch is something like ten-to-fifteen billion dollars we cannot afford that kind of stuff what do you think about the fact that they are\n                  planning to power the new missions using nuclear?bo\u2019l ah that is disaster you know if\n                  you get me going on nuclear i was the nuclear energy advisor\n                  to morris udall\u2019s energy and environment subcommittee\n                  of the us congress and our committee pretty single-handedly\n                  stopped nuclear power in its tracks any kind of nuclear technology for anybody that looks at\n                  it is highly dangerous the long-lived radioactive waste products we have not found a way to bury them they have half-lives\n                  of tens of thousands of years we are polluting the earth\n                  for our children and their children and for all of nature we have got tolet go of that technology\n                  one hundred percent for nuclear technology to be used in any\n                  space application or any application on the earth is yet another\n                  big danger-point it is sort of like right now humans are terror-forming the\n                  earth with various geo-engineering projects whether it is\n                  the development of nuclear technology or chemtrails or depleted\n                  uranium these are all horrible horrible projects and you see we need to develop a new kind of advocacy a\n                  new combination of truth movements that look at all of these\n                  things  9/11 the official story  to kind of \u201cpop\n                  a bubble of the sacred myths of our time and to proceed\n                  onward with the kinds of new technologies that are clean and\n                  cheap like free energy we just have to do this and people\n                  have to awaken and right now there are not very many\n                  of us that advocate that so to the degree your listeners can begin to embrace these\n                  things and to make the leap of faith if you will before really\n                  finding out in great detail that a number of myths need to\n                  be destroyed we need some sort of process of truth and reconciliation we need to radically change our systems and obama is now about\n                  .00001 percent of the way in doing any of that so it is disappointing but we just keep having to prevail\n                  and get to the truth which is always the first step toward\n                  realizing what we need to do wade what would you say about the fact that you know free energy exists it is been out there for i do not know since at least the 1950s would not\n                  you say and yet they are planning on powering the next\n                  mission to mars and the moon using nuclear fuel well you know brian is the astronaut [kerry\n                  laughs] so i definitely defer to brian\u2019s opinion on those\n                  things but it is a thing where right actually what brian was just discussing i have a short anecdote which was dennis and i spoke at department\n                  of energy hearings back in 1997 when they were trying to do\n                  the what is called the\n                  wipp which was\n                  the low-intensity nuclear waste not the place in nevada where\n                  they still it is not even big enough to hold what they\n                  got today it was the thing where we approached them with neutralization\n                  technology to make nuclear waste i mean to neutralize it and we were using brown\u2019s gas long story there but\n                  anyway interestingly we spoke there and we were located right\n                  next to this savannah facility like on atomic boulevard anyway dennis\n                    and i spoke at a couple of hearings that day and the interesting thing was that the most excited person\n                  at the hearing was the person who organized it and at the\n                  lunch break he actually follows us out to the car and gives\n                  us his card and stuff and he said that we were the third group\n                  that attended these hearings to present a neutralization technology and he said and i will never forget this he said the people managing nuclear waste stand\n                  to make a ton of money doing this if your answer does not\n                  make them a ton of money it will not go anywhere and\n                  then he said i am an underling\n                  with no power but i will see what i can do and of course nothing happened anyway so to me yes as brian said actually\n                  using nuclear fission to actually power these missions and\n                  stuff  it is\n                  nightmarish it is totally nightmarish in fact when\n                  i know that other totally clean benign technologies\n                  exist and we are using this you know  extremely\n                  primitive as einstein said nuclear fission\u2019s\n                  one hell of a way to boil water so it is\n                  just really horrifying it is actually horrifying that\n                  we are doing these things ok thank you so much both of you\n                  guys because that is great to hear you say that and of\n                  course to hear an astronaut talk about the absurdity\n                  of using nuclear fuel to send missions out and here we are\n                  in 2009 it just kind of boggles the mind this has to be a\n                  fake you know front game really for what is really going\n                  on behind the scenes you have to believe in terms of nasa\n                  and what is\n                  really going on there but what i will do here is bill can you come forward and sort of ask a few questions yourself and i will translate if necessary ok thank you i just want to thank all\n                  of you actually because ever since i realized that my british james\n                  bond shaken-but-not-stirred accent was not totally\n                  understandable there i have been sitting in the front\n                  row of this audience hugely enjoying this conversation and\n                  i want to thank you very much for that and kerry thanks\n                  a lot for stepping into the mc\u2019s shoes here because\n                  i know that you had not prepared yourself quite as much\n                  for this interview as i had by reading wade\u2019s voluminous\n                  1200-page website that i invite anyone to take a lucky dip\n                  into because it is encyclopedic.brian has already answered the final question that i wanted\n                  to put to you both which was what changes does he really hope\n                  to see in his lifetime and what i would like to do is just to ask wade briefly if you can say something to that that would inspire any young\n                  activists because they are out there we hear from them regularly people who are on a steep learning curve and a lot of energy and who have not yet had that energy blunted we know\n                  that they are out there and those people will find a\n                  way to listen to this conversation because it is going\n                  to be very important to them and the opportunity here is to leave those people with something\n                  that will inspire and encourage them to pick up the torch which\n                  you two have both been carrying and of course many others\n                  have been carrying this torch as well what can you leave these\n                  young warriors with to help them continue with what you have\n                  considered your life\u2019s work to be well thank you what my message would\n                  be is this you\n                    are not pursuing something ephemeral you are pursuing\n                    things that are very real ok these are very\n                    real this stuff\u2019s real it is not a fantasy it is\n                    not some crazy conspiracy theory this is very real stuff and the potential of this is something that none of us can\n                    really fathom we really cannot fathom what the potential\n                    of something like this is and so i do not know i mean i do not know to me that seems worthwhile you know wade your life itself and also brian\u2019s\n                  life both of you are an inspiration in itself i mean your\n                  actual life experience - and sharing that - is very powerful and i am very happy that bill was scientifically astute\n                  enough to be able to target and find you out because you are\n                  not really in the mainstream at the moment but you are\n                  obviously a person that deserves great respect as does brian and it is really lovely to hear you speak about your background\n                  and all so i just want to thank you very much both of you i think this has been an excellent conversation i want to thank you both for your time and your commitment it is a long rough road i think that you two guys have\n                  been on and by speaking out so energetically and positively i think that you will have done a lot to encourage an interest\n                  and enlighten some of these young activists who we know will\n                  be watching this  because this torch must be picked\n                  up it is a torch that must grow more\n                  and more brightly i am convinced now wade having read a lot of your site that free energy is such a huge issue and also i should say\n                  having read several of brian\u2019s books as well it goes\n                  everywhere it goes into the environment it goes into the\n                  economy it goes into politics it goes into control agendas it goes into every aspect of society that we know about this\n                  is why it is really at the heart of everything and of\n                  course this is why the activists do get stomped on so hard but you are still standing and we acknowledge and salute\n                  you for that and thank you very much indeed for your inspiration\n                  to everyone who will be listening to this.bo\u2019l thank you bill thank you bill and thank you for what you and\n                  kerry are doing it is important work thanks for being\n                  there click\n                  here for the audio\n                  interview \n \u00a0\n\n\n\narjan bos (ab hello this is a video interview by willen\nwij weten my name is arjan bos and for those of you who do not know willen wij weten is a dutch alternative news website which means do we want to know today august the 2nd of the year 2009 we are very happy to have bill\nryan and kerry cassidy of project camelot with us here in amsterdam bill\nand kerry welcome kerry\ncassidy (kc thank you bill\nryan (br and as we say in english the\nboot is on the other foot because\nwe are on the other side of the camera you know yeah i think this is the first time is this the first time\nsomeone\u2019s done us done a video interview of us it might be i do not know if it has happened before we have had a lot of interviews but actually not on video i\ndo not think not on video you have had radio interviews i have heard some radio\ninterviews yeah and we have done conferences but we have not done a video\ninterview with someone like yourself i do not think and if\nthere is someone out there saying well what about mine then we are sorry we cannot remember it because we cannot\nremember everything i would really like that area conference i would like to go into\nmore personal detail than is usual in project camelot videos and\nalso when you are interviewed in radio interviews it is\nmostly about the subjects that you cover in the project camelot what\ni am also interested in is because you put a lot out\nthere already in your personal stories for example i listened to a\nradio show a couple of weeks ago and in that you mentioned bill that you once had an et girlfriend oh my goodness okay yes why did i have to say\nthat and we really are wondering about that how did you know this what\nwas it like well okay as we say in english how\nlong have you got because it is a long story um i am trying to think of how best to present the story it was\ndefinitely linked to an abduction experience which i had in the\nhimalayas  and this is something i do not often talk about i\ndid actually mention it with our interview with steven greer that\nis going to be published in a few days time by the time this\nis out people will have had a chance to see that just\nto give some context for that the reason why i mentioned that to\nsteven greer on camera \u2013 i took a deep breath and said okay i will tell people about my own abduction experience\n\u2013 is because he was saying that most if not all of abductions\nwere actually faked by the american military in some way yeah now this was in december 1981 and i was at 7,000 meters in the\nhimalayas in december in winter in northern nepal on a mountain\ncalled makalu on a small british expedition we were trying to climb\nit we did not actually do it but we got quite high ed\nnote mt makalu is the 5th-highest\nmountain in the world it is just 14 miles east of mt everest i\nwas abducted out of my tent in the middle of the night in december it is not a usual abduction when they come to like an\napartment in amsterdam which is all nice and easy and i do not think any abduction is easy do you no sure but this was quite\nunusual because i was floated out of my tent the temperature was\nprobably \u2013 it was the middle of the night in december in the\nhimalayas at 7,000 meters \u2013 the temperature must have been\nabout minus 40 celsius maybe colder when\ni recalled this happening  because as with almost\nall abductions you do not remember  when i recalled it\nhappening the moment that i remember sitting in my tent i\nwas lying in my tent the three of us like sardines there is my\nfriend here and my friend here and i was like that and i was all\nzipped up in my sleeping bag then the zip of the tent opened and\nthis little gray being poked his head through and looked at me you\nknow like that that\nwas the single most frightening moment of my whole life when i\nremembered that moment i nearly jumped right out of my chair and\nwent through the ceiling when i remembered that it is like oh my god you know mm-hm and then i mean it was real because you do not get shocked\nby an imaginary memory you get shocked by a real memory yeah now this is all very complicated because i do not believe that\nwas a malicious abduction i believe that something was going on\nwhich was in some way a preparation for what we are doing now okay it probably was all with my agreement at a higher level because i am\nvery comfortable with what is happening now at the time i\ndid not understand the experience but i was not it is\nlike i\ndo not know what is going on what is going on what is\ngoing on but it was not something that i\nwished had not happened i just wanted to know why it was\ngoing on now it is so very\ncomplicated at that time one of the people i was with was a\nmountaineer friend of mine he was a small guy he was i can only\nspeak in terms of english feet he was about five-foot two what is\nthat about one meter sixty somebody something like that something like that mm-hm he was quite a small guy he had had an et experience at that time\nas well in the same expedition the previous day he only told me\nabout this years later when he was going down the mountain from the\nsame place he fell into a crevasse which is not a good idea if\nyou are a mountaineer on your own usually that is the end\nof the game that is it yeah he fell into a crevasse and the way that he told the story was next\nthing i knew i was out of the crevasse he had been teleported out of the crevasse and there were two\nbeings there who talked with him for a long time when\nhe was telling me this story i was becoming really freaked out\nbecause i knew that just the day after that i had my abduction\nexperience and we were comparing our experiences now round about that time as well i had a girlfriend who was also\nvery small she was even smaller she was about four-foot ten what\nwould that be that is small i mean one meter forty or something that is pretty small yeah she had a lot of very interesting psychic powers she was a very\nunusual person she would always tell me and this always kind of\nslightly freaked me out because i really enjoyed being with her she\nsaid you are\nvery special she said we\nwill not always be together but i will always love you and i mean i do not know how\nto you know how on earth do you respond to something like\nthat she\nwould know when things were going to happen she had make the\nphone ring and she had be totally telepathic once or twice i had\nbe really upset and she had just look into my eyes and then the\nupset would disappear all this kind of weird stuff but then humans can do that too one\nnight we were in bed just cuddling in bed it was about 11 of the clock\nat night she had her back to the door and i was looking over her\nshoulder towards the door and then this being\nappeared in the door okay it\nwas not like a classical gray being but it looked very much\nlike what arthur neumann \ndescribes as a child-like being with quite big eyes but not the kind\nof weird eyes you know kind of large eyes and quite a round head but also quite small also like the being you saw in your tent not like the being i saw in my tent the being i saw in my tent was\nmore of the classical gray you see okay okay and i saw this being in my room sitting right there \u2013\nsorry  standing right there in the doorway i froze and did not\nsay anything because i could not believe what i was seeing angie which was her name she had her back to the door and i did not\nsay a word she said do not\nworry it is all right i have seen them all my life you have\ngot nothing to be afraid of this being is behind her and i had not\nsaid anything this whole thing completely freaked me out then\ni spoke to my other friend about this dave now he was the\nmountaineer guy he said i\nknow that that happened oh i said how do you know he said i\njust know then\nthat freaked me out even more and i went back to angie and i told\nher about the conversation i had had with dave and it was \u2019round\nabout that time that he told me about the incident in the himalayas \u2013\nthis is a very complicated story  and angie said i\nhave not talked with dave about any of this but looking into\ndave\u2019s head is like looking into my own she said and\nthese two small beings with these strange abilities angie would say\nthings to me like an example was what i mentioned before she had\nsay you are very\nspecial and we will not always be together but i will always love you one\nday we were sitting having breakfast just like with the croissants\nand the coffee and you know and she just looked at me and she said the earth is a very\nbeautiful place and it will not always be this way i have\nnever forgotten those words it sends a chill down my spine every\ntime i think about it and\ni said what what did you\nsay you know and she\njust almost ignored the fact that she had said it and she just\ncarried on eating breakfast there\nwere a number of other things which she said which i cannot\nremember mm-hm but \u2019round about this time i found myself thinking this\nperson is not a normal person absolutely not a normal person no what she said comes from a place of knowing there is something\nreally strange going on here i\nmean i can spend two hours talking about all the experiences i have\nhad here but something which was really remarkable happened actually there are two more\nparts of this story i do not want to take this story\naway from you because you have got a lot of stories of your own\nhere it does not matter two other things happened that are worth recording the second one\nof which which i will\nsay here i never tell\nanybody because it is so bizarre she\nattended a personal-development workshop where you get in touch with\nsome of the thoughts and beliefs that you have that limit yourself and all of that kind of stuff she was very small she was the eldest\nof three sisters but she was the smallest and she had always\nmake kind of jokes about herself you know she had say i am\nnot really small people just think i am small you\nknow and so on and so forth in\nthis workshop she realized that she had an investment in being small in other words because she was small she got to be the center of\nattention she got to make jokes about herself she got to you\nknow it is what psychologists and therapists call a \u201cpay\noff mm-hm when she realized that she grew she was 26 years old and she grew\n\u2013 i have got to do the calculation again \u2013 she grew\ntwo and a half inches which is about eight centimeters in two\nweeks wow and i have a feeling that it was actually overnight but i cannot\nprove that it was definitely within two weeks and\nwhat happened was like something out of a comedy film i had not\nseen her for a little while because she had been doing this\nworkshop and stuff and i went to give her a hug and i said look there is no need for you to stand on your toes she\nsaid i am not\nstanding on my toes and\ni said yes you are\nbecause you are taller she\nsaid i am not\ntaller what do you mean and\nshe said look i\nlooked and she was standing flat on her feet and she was taller then we ran around the house seeing if she could fit into her\nclothes and if she could fit into her shoes and her shoes would not\nfit so she was not aware of it herself no okay for some reason she had no idea which is why i think this happened\nreally suddenly i have a feeling this happened really suddenly no this is biologically impossible but then you start talking\nwith high strangeness very very high strangeness but she definitely grew we measured\nher it was midnight and i went around phoning up all my friends saying angie\u2019s\ngrown angie\u2019s grown arjan\nlaughs]\n\n\n\nand\nthey said what what are\nyou talking what it\nwas like something out of a very very bad comedy movie but that\nhappened she did grow i\ngot really excited i said right you are going to keep on growing you are going to be\nreally tall but she\nfreaked out about this whole thing because there is this human\naspect of her and then she stopped she stopped growing it\nwas remarkable and that really happened the\nother thing that happened was the culmination of what i had\nearlier described as she was saying you know we are\nnot always going to be together but i will always love you and\none day she just left she\nsaid okay i am\ngoing now she said my purpose in your life is complete and\nthat is enough to freak you out when you really love somebody\nand spend three years with them she said my\npurpose in your life is complete now i am going i will\nalways love you bye-bye i\nsaid what is the\nproblem she\nsaid there is no\nproblem my purpose in your life is complete this\nis why i think this whole thing whatever it was connected with this\nabduction experience and my other friend dave was some kind of a\nsetup for this ed note this being his current\ninvolvement with project camelot]\n\n\ni\nwas hugely\nupset by this as you might imagine yeah i could not cope with this at all i had no way of coping with\nthis and\nit was christmas time we had bought tickets for a skiing\nholiday and it is like well what about my skiing holiday she\nsaid just give the ticket\nto someone else it is okay i\nhad some people staying in my house and i was so upset i stayed in\nbed for three days i could not handle it i went into a\npersonal black hole this\nwas 20 years ago this was in 1986 on\nthe third day and this is what i do not tell anyone it is\nthe most extraordinary story on the third day another being appeared\nin my room like the first one and you know that story that scene\nin the movie et you know when he has his glowing red finger and he heals elliot\nbecause eliot is upset you know the little boy who he befriends this\nis what happened to me this being appeared in my room and i had\nbeen sitting there in bed unable to move unable to function could not handle this this was not intended the being came up\nto me with his finger touched in the middle of the chest [snaps\nfingers] and then i was fine all the upset went away and i went\ndownstairs and the whole thing was handled for me wow yeah it was a remarkable story i do not tell people that because\nthere is no way anyone can believe it i do not believe it\nmyself you know but that is what happened it is\na very important story for one reason that despite its\nunbelievability what it shows me is that these beings who were\nbehind that abduction and that experience and that program whatever\nit was they actually have compassion they really do have\ncompassion yeah this was not a mindless programmed biological robot this was\nsomebody who came in \u2013 because it was not part of the plan\nthat i should be so upset that i could not function \u2013 so\nthey had to fix that and they fixed it and it was a compassionate\nact and you could really feel it like that it just disappeared everything disappeared like somebody turned a\nswitch and i was not upset anymore i was not upset because\nsomething was added on like a mask the upset was handled because they took the upset away which is the basis of all of\neffective\ntherapeutic programs the\ncharge that is associated with an incident you remove that\ncharge then you are back to normal again it is the charge\nthat makes people upset so they lifted the charge off [snaps\nfingers] and then it had gone i\nsuppose i have had a few strange experiences since then but i\nhave not had anything like that every now and then i kind of\nhope they might come back and say hey\nguys you are doing a great job but nothing nothing of that nature you never saw her again either i never saw her again okay extraordinary story it is a remarkable story but one of the reasons why i do not\ntell it well actually there are three reasons why i do not\ntell it one is the standard reason why anyone who is had a\nstrange experience usually do not tell their story because\npeople start looking at them a little bit weird yep another thing is because it is so complicated that it is\nhard to explain and\nthe third reason and all of these things are reasons which i hold\nat the same time the third reason is that other people have\nexperiences that actually i believe are far more significant we\ninterviewed jim\nsparks you\nknow and god alone can understand what kind of experiences he is\nbeen through and last night we were talking to somebody whose whole\nlife has been about this you know over and over and over again i\nalso do not want to be sort of attracting attention to myself as\nsome special case here because i do not think it it is a\nweird story but it is not a special case i have\nsort of integrated it into my life and the way i have integrated\nit into my life is by saying you know what i am not even going to try and understand that but it is got something to do with what i am doing now what i am doing\nnow is important and who i am now is important this\nkind of goes right back to where we are now and the subject of this\nconversation and this is where i want to stop monopolizing the\nconversation to bring kerry into it because we have had the feeling\nover and over again ever since we started that we have been helped we have been guided we have had doors opened for us and\nwe have been assisted by hidden hands we\ndo not know whether they are et whether they are\nangelic whatever on earth is going on but there is no\nreasonable way that we could have done what we have done without\nsome kind of help the\nmetaphor which i often use is walking towards a blank wall and then\nthe door suddenly opens and you go through into another room you\ncannot see the door until you get there and then it suddenly magically appears that is\nbeen the experience we have had ever since the beginning and now\ni am going to stop talking okay well the energetics around you too it is very clear\nthat this happens that you must in whatever way have some help yeah but we are not the only ones this is the important\nthing no true we are not trying to be special and i am not trying to be\nspecial i experience it myself yeah sure everyone in this room probably has had experiences that\nthey find hard to explain some people have really\nweird experiences and they do not even talk about them at all but the number of human beings who have had remarkable transformative experiences is much larger than anyone would think i am quite sure of it yeah that is my very long elevator speech see what happens when you\nask me a simple question yeah true it is a real danger i can talk for an hour maybe in the same radio interview i heard you also say\nthat you had a ufo experience when you were young and i wondered\nabout that how was it did you feel it had any significance of well i have to say that my experience is a little different than\nbill\u2019s in the sense that since i was young i think i had a\nrepetitious experience going on all the time when i was young i\nhad a recurring nightmare i would go to sleep and then i would be\nwalking down a path out of my front door it was a little path and\nthere was a picket fence i did not live in a house that had a\npath and a picket fence okay but this is what i\nwould dream mm-hm and at the end of the picket fence there would be a man standing\nthere with a fedora  you know one of those hats from like a spy\nmovie  and an overcoat like a zorro or something and i was afraid i would hear sort of a buzzing sound and\nthen i would wake up and i would be terrified that was recurring all the time at\nthe same time strangely enough not so long ago i saw a video of\nmyself with my family when i was i must have been i do not\nknow 16 or something like that and i just looked different than\neveryone else i do not know how to explain it mm-hm my sister i can tell you that this is so strange that my sister\nactually turned to me looked at the video and said who\nis that i\nturned to her and i said it is\nme and she is like\nshe did not remember me from then or something like that it was\njust a weird and strange thing yeah and i looked at myself this has happened to me before it\nhappened to me when i was in school i was videotaped for a i was\ndoing a speech or something and i did not know who that was\nwhen i looked at the thing i\ndo not know how to explain that but it was a strange thing that\nwould happen to me and i was filmed when i was a kid they were\nshooting movies around the school or something just kids things so anyway beyond that as i was reading books on magic and things when i was eleven i was very \u2013 i taught myself to\nread when i was very very young before i could go to school my\nbrother was going to school and i would sit at the door and wait for\nhim to come home so i could ask him a word so i was very i do not\nknow precocious you might say mm-hm i would not say that i was extraordinarily brilliant or some\nkind of thing like that but i was very aware i guess i was fully\naware when i was a kid like i was very upset that i was a kid because i could not go out and\njust run my life i did not understand why i was put into this\nbody and this thing that i was little and a child because in my\nhead i was not that person you know i was in another place but\nbesides that i also had i guess awareness of beings\nbeing around all the time but have they frightened you certainly i saw ufos later okay when we were older i just knew about them in fact i had\nsome friends even i\nwent to new york and i studied acting and a couple friends said to\nme one day they said well you are really like an et we\nwere just walking down the street i was not in camelot and i\nwas not associated with ufos and i was not studying them\nor any of that stuff we were involved in music and art and things they\njust turned to me and said well you are just like an et or something and i was like i was hurt by that all right i thought oh my god what is it i am doing and saying that is so odd that these\npeople are like that and saying that about me but\nthen i also knew exactly what i was doing i knew about eastern\nphilosophy and i was tested in college in a class by a person who\nwas from india i wrote some kind of essay and he read it to the\nclass and he said well you know all about this stuff and i had never read a book about it at all mm-hm but anyway i decided that i would reach enlightenment it\nwas my decision when i was like 21 or something i was just going\nto do this so\ni just got some books on kundalini and so on and then i sat and\nmeditated i ended up meditating every day for like hours and hours\nfor probably a month or so i stopped kind of going to work and\neverything else and i did i reached kundalini samadhi what is called a samadhi\nexperience and merged with everything so\ni did all this very consciously i knew i was going to do it i\nplanned it and i did it you know so i have to say i would classify\nit more  spiritual experiences like i came at the ufo thing from\na more spiritual place yeah but you know my family was camping in lake tahoe and it was fourth\nof july or something like that and we were just having a camping\ntrip and sleeping under the stars i do not know how old i was maybe in my twenties or maybe thirties at that point and\nup in the sky were all these well they looked like stars but then they just started moving around and they were all moving i\nmean it just went on for hours and we were just watching and i said look at all the ufos i\nwas the only one in my family who knew anything about that and i\ndirected their attention to that and then we just watched it it was\nlike they were having a party basically in space because all the\nstars were not just sitting there they were all just moving around\nand going places and zipping back and forth it was like they were\nhaving a huge meeting for everyone to see well my family yeah okay it was not just you who saw it it was a display yeah it was just going on and on but they were way far up there so\nthey looked like stars but they literally were zipping around so\nthat was fine that was just like normal or it just seemed normal you know it did not seem like a big deal to you but to your family it was extraordinary i reckon well they did not get all excited or anything really i mean we were laughing about it just laying in our sleeping bags\nkind of laughing about it and stuff but they do not consciously\nseem to think about this kind of thing that i am involved in camelot and all that they do not even know i\nmean they know i have said go\nto my website blah blah but\nthey do not go one sister is not online at all and she is\nthe one that would be i mean she is open to things she is\nfairly psychically aware mm-hm my other sister has had i think experiences you know how they say\nthese abductions whatever run in families i do believe we have had\nthat in my family okay yeah my mother was quite interesting she was very aware and open to all\nsorts of spiritual things but at the same time you know she also\nwas very conventional in certain ways so to answer your question i have not had any other than i see\nlight beings all the time i actually saw a couple not last night\nbut the night before before we went on stage two of them came they\nvisit me for a while and then they disappear i have seen them\nsince i was in my twenties all right they have accompanied me to places and whenever i would be in a\nstate where i had be very upset you know because i was a sort\nof struggling actor and lived in new york city and studied acting i\ndid not have any money and i did not always know if i could\neat that day and i hated borrowing money from my parents so i\nwould not tell them and so on and so forth so\ni had some rough times and they were always they would come\nand visit me okay so your initial experience in your dreams were very\nfrightening actually that one yeah when i was a really little kid and i was afraid of\nsanta claus i know this sounds stupid  but when christmas\nwould come and you know this was when we were really young and\nthey would say oh santa\nclaus is going to come and\nsanta claus came supposedly and flew in the sky right oh right so i just remember thinking to myself oh well if there is such a being as santa claus i am not\ninterested in looking out the window or letting them know that i am\nawake because they were\ngoing to you know yeah because they were going to do something yeah i was afraid of something but your overall feeling after all those years would you label it\nas more positive or more negative well i am not convinced of what was going on then there is\nsome other things that i have just put together recently which\nhave to do with milabs which is when m-i-l-itary a-b-duction-s yeah my whole family all the kids in my family  there is\nfour of us  were born in a certain hospital except for me i was\nborn in a military hospital in palo alto near moffett field which is\na military base mm-hm and i always thought well i am special i was born in a special hospital you\nknow different than everyone but i never put two and two together just\nrecently i have been thinking well is not that interesting my father was a pilot in world war ii he built his own airplane he\nwas quite brilliant in his way and i do not know what that is\nabout and\ni am sure my mother would have no idea she would say oh that is ridiculous nothing went on but it was just like a weird little thing that went on there so\nif you put that together with the guy with the overcoat and the\nbuzzing and whatever maybe there is something that went on\nearly on hmm okay but who knows yeah and maybe we can never know these things yeah maybe you have an overall feeling if it is more right or\nif it is more something you do not want yeah now when i look back on it i am sure that this is\nprobably an overall positive thing that i was very involved in but\nat the same time i am also you know i am aware\nthat there are positive and negative beings like i have no doubt in\nmy mind whatsoever it\ncould be that this comes from my own past of having been exposed to\nthem on different levels i am psychically aware of a lot of\nthings going on i see things and pretty much have kept it to\nmyself even now in camelot you know this is not the kind of thing that we talk about even to each\nother because our focus is external to ourselves and it is on\nother people yeah right it is not meant to be about us you know yeah but it guides us i have to say i mean i will tell bill\nthings that we need to do or this or that because i am getting\na direct very strong message and he gets this occasionally as well okay and i think that in many ways we are protected on an earthly level but i think we are very protected on an unseen level i think one of the things that unites us which i have only\nrecently really realized is unusual is that we have no fear none none none at all absolutely none that is quite extraordinary the idea of us having fear is so unusual that we do not even\nthink about the fact that we do not have fear we just do our\nthing it is other people who point out what are not you afraid yeah i have trouble understanding to some degree some people that is not because i am not afraid of anything you know i have had times in my life where i have been alone and sort\nof a desperate situation whatever i mean when that spider appeared in looks directly at\nkerry]\n\n\n\n when i moved to new york city from california stop it when i moved to new york city spiders are a big problem oh okay i do not like spiders but i moved to new york city when i was\na kid you know like in my young  i do not know i was in my\nlate twenties  to study acting and coming from northern\ncalifornia if you know anything about that you\nknow i grew up in northern california and that is a \u201ccertain\nkind of a person like northern california we have sort of a\nthing about that we are like cool we are very advanced you know oh okay that is why the sixties happened really happened in san\nfrancisco and this whole apple computer and the whole thing yeah i grew up near apple computer and all that the fancy part of the world well i do not know but when i moved to new york it was a\ncomplete drastic difference to hit the streets and have zillions of\npeople everywhere and also to go in the subway and stuff it was very\nintimidating for a young sort of blondish person a female\nespecially so in that sense i knew fear you know what i am\nsaying yeah okay but in terms of camelot it is just not even a second thought i do not know why i just know that we in\nother words i will do and say just about anything we have been\ntold like i was just told a number of times recently that i had\nbe killed if i said certain things and i have said them you\nknow we are not stupid i have to say but by the same token\nit is like you know you get a lot of requests i think from whistleblowers to get on you determine which one you give stage and which you do not and\nit is probably all intuitive because no story is actually\nverifiable yeah we do have well more or less and you have to make constantly choices do\nwe give stage or do not we that is right do you decline a lot do you get a lot of requests i am\na whistleblower and i have a story and we get a lot of people writing to us saying i am\nthe most important person in the world i had this special et\nexperience i am\nsorry but it is very common we get zillions of emails of this\ntype just recently i was looking at my inbox we had two people\nwriting to us saying i\nwant you to interview me i have got this most important story and it is just your typical abduction experience mm-hm now this needs a caveat\nbecause we are not trying to minimize or marginalize anyone\nwho is had a very important personal experience what kerry\u2019s\nreally talking about i think is context and some people for\nunderstandable reasons they have trouble integrating their own\nexperience but it is important to say that this is worldwide what happens is everyone has a special thing because it seems special to them but we\nactually get i have to say we do get people writing to us saying i have got the message for the planet this\nis really what they say and what they think they think they are the\none and this is a\npitfall in this world that we are in one\nof the bell-ringers for us in evaluating whether or not to talk to a\nperson is how what happens is a real whistleblower comes across\nvery subtly very buttoned up very low-key they rarely tell us everything in the first email they write to us\nand they say i have a\ncouple things to talk to you about i wonder if sometimes\nit is a one-liner sometimes they will put in one word that\nmight be like a covert way to see if we are awake and aware and\nwhether we pick up on it so it is a fascinating process what\ngoes on in terms of people communicating to us the\nother part of that is that in a sense we are not really a\nwebsite for abductees and contactees no no no that is actually not our area of expertise or the area that\nwe have decided to focus on okay we really have decided to focus on whistleblowers that come out of\nthe sort of black projects but on the other hand what has\nhappened is that some of our researchers some of the people that we\nhave been attracted to interview for intuitive reasons have had et\nexperiences and contact and channeling and so on yeah i really like the broadness of the spectrum you cover in your\ninterviews we do not have a strategy or a plan you see these things come\nat us in a very holistic integrated way things just happen almost\nlike there is some kind of a script being written in an\nesoteric sense what we do is we just go with the flow we\nboth feel intuitively \u2013 it is exactly what kerry\u2019s\nsaid \u2013 we get a message sometimes because we both get all of\nour mail we both hone in on the same message saying this\nmessage here have you read that and\nshe had say yeah i have just read that this moment this person feels important and\nalmost invariably that is significant but i term it as in a sense we are following the trail of a\nmystery we are going where the trail and the clues lead us that means that even right now we cannot tell you we are\nnot going to rule somebody out because you say oh this person\u2019s in the health field or this person\u2019s\nin the such-and-such field actually there is no area that we will not go in but it only depends on if\nwe get the push to follow the clue and to go in that direction so logically like there is some people who collect all the\ninterviews with everyone who is ever talked about such-and-such right and ever written a book about such-and-such we\ndo not actually do that we do not duplicate what we are\ndoing is actually following a trail so if we get one person in a\ncertain area that one person is very well chosen at least from our\npoint of view okay yeah and you can feel it to follow you and your work it is\nquite extraordinary actually yeah i really encourage you to we like to see the big picture we want to paint the big picture so\neach is a piece of the puzzle they are not duplicate pieces i also like that you do not have the same opinion always never i mean it is funny because we will agree\non intuitive sort of messages sometimes but in terms of overall\napproach it is drastically different he is more the\nscientific  we say mulder\nand\nscully from x-files\n only he is scully\nand i am mulder because he is the scientist and i am\nmore the intuitive communicator on the money thing how does money work for you because a couple of\nmonths ago a couple of weeks ago i read on your blog  money\nis a problem everybody has to make a living and here we have two\nbeautiful people doing most extraordinary work for waking up the\nplanet to a certain story what\nis your view on that why does everything at the core of your work\nhave to be free i mean there must be some way to somehow support you\nmore by the people that watch your videos i think i might imagine that you could do better and more if you had less worry about money in a way hmm let me answer this first there are different ways to go at\nthis and it is an interesting question for\nme it is about a philosophical reversal of the principle of\nmoney which is based on exchange if i have got a coffee shop i\ngive you the cup of coffee and then you give me three euros or three\ndollars or whatever it is and that is the exchange but\ni say to you i have\ngot the cup of coffee here i am not going to give it to you\nunless you give me the money first that is how it works or unless you agree\nto give me the money first and then it is changed now usually that is the way business is done and the way that\nthings are sold on the internet often it is like you have\ngot a dvd or you have got a video or you have got a book and it is like okay you give me the money then i will send you the information yeah okay now what we have done is we have put it in reverse it like we will give you all the information and we trust that\nit is going to come back to us and maybe i give you the\ninformation and he gives me the money it does not matter it\ndoes not matter who gives us the money you see because it is\nthe principle of flow the principle is that we give people whatever\nwe have and then if the universe is playing fair and it seems to\nbe then we get a return you may remind people more of doing that for example if i look at\nmyself i made like four or five times a small donation and i\nexpect maybe everybody does that but apparently it does not\nhappen if\ni was reminded more often in a video at the end of a video for\nexample to make a donation then i probably would have done it more\noften yeah our cameraman is very pleased that you just said that because\nthis is his advice to us and we are going to start doing this it was his idea that is why i am bringing it up yeah thank you very much but for me there is a point here as well you see it is\nlike that also becomes part of the process that we do not think\nabout it is just like okay this is like an article of trust we just trust it is going to work that way and then it does the\nphilosophical backdrop for wanting\nto do it that way is because the information is not ours to sell no it is not ours you cannot have copyright on this stuff people who think well i own this information and i own the words in\nthis interview and i own my experience and you cannot have it \u2013\nthis is very very small limited human thinking which is very old\nparadigm we are\nonly acting as a \u201cchannel for this information as a way\nof getting this information out it is not ours so how can we sell something that does not belong to us maybe you should not think about that i thought about\nsomething yesterday and i want to bring that into the world with this\ninterview i\nthought it maybe would be nice to make a kind of a tribute to bill\nand kerry from all kinds of whistleblowers they have had all\nkinds of people that watch your videos in holland we do that a lot with let us say for example the tsunami hit here we have sixteen\nmillion people and there was one tv show and we raised about 100\nmillion euros for that maybe\nthat is an idea maybe someone will pick it up maybe not that is just an idea i had well thank you i have to say that our philosophy on this is a\nlittle bit different we are both aligned in the sense that this\nmaterial needs to be free at the outset what\nit is about is that you know we talked about it yesterday which is the idea of people not having access whether it is to\ninformation or truth or secrets so the last thing we want to do is\nput a barrier there between the people and the truth that we want to\nget out there so\nwe want that to get out there and thank god for the internet because\nit is there it is a medium that allows us to do that so\nwe were completely in agreement from day one everything was going to\nbe free okay mm-hm that is beautiful and that has to happen in fact we have been offered to do a\ntelevision show you know like on regular tv okay although it did not actually happen this was a year\nago even\nthen we were saying to the producers but\nyou do understand that our videos are going to be free on camelot it\nhas to be that way now on the other hand we are at least i am more practical because\ni am a filmmaker what we do not do is package dvds and\nwhat we need to do is do that and those would go for sale because\nthere is a labor and a cost to actually produce that okay yeah now there is a labor and a cost to produce what we do definitely but we are kind of like i said guerilla filmmakers and we are\ngoing on the paradigm that if we put it out there it will come back i mean we do believe that and it has worked although\ni have to say for the first two years i had a small inheritance\nfrom my mother passing and we financed  we are self-financed then the last year bill\u2019s mother passed and we had a small\namount of money from there that kept us going then\nwe also started asking for donations i think now it is been\nalmost a year and a half ago our avalon site we started charging\nfor subscriptions \u2013 a dollar or whatever you want or\nfive dollars a month but that has not actually been all that\nsuccessful people did not want to pay so much for being on a\nforum and so on but\nwe try to convey to them that what that subscription was going to do\nwas go into the camelot work so that the information sort of fuels\neverything else right because anybody we interview is going to help\nraise the level of consciousness and also for the avalon side of\nthings which is the side which has to do with finding safe places preparing for the future in sort of a nuts and bolts way yep and we do have another site that we are looking to do which is\ncalled project light warrior you mentioned that on the radio yeah we are going to help people develop themselves because beyond\ndeveloping your own safe place and getting into groups and\nnetworking there is a side that is more spiritual about\npreparing for the days to come you need to become as enlightened as\nyou can be and become as much of a spiritual warrior as possible and there we have got yoda on the wall there to remind us exactly because what we are facing is much more of a spiritual\nexperience it will manifest physically here on the material realm on the 3d but the real sort of nuts and bolts battle if you will will happen for the hearts and minds of humanity so\nthat is what we want to help in the future to equip people along\nthose lines there is a spiritual war going on it is just that right here\nand now on this planet this seems to be one of the front lines that is one way to put it so you cannot put a price on that you cannot say you\nknow we really must educate people we must make them become aware we must encourage them to do so so that is where there had\nbe no barrier to entry no matter what now we have been approached some people do not want to look at\nour videos because it is hard to stream and it takes time and\nwe have had all logistical things go on so they want to purchase\na dvd or even to hand it out to family and friends yeah in that sense we have actually been pretty remiss because we\ncannot lay out the money it costs to pay for i do not\nknow thousands of dvds to be printed and then put it on our site\nand sell it and all this kind of thing we actually are very bad in\nthat area and we know it so in a sense we could be more sort of proactive in funding our work\nthan we are i think many people would really like to support you in that way well thank you but the principle of funding would always be adding\nvalue not saying we are\nnot going to tell you unless you pay us ahh the information would always be available but for instance the\nadvantage of a dvd is that the quality is higher the thing about avalon is that even though we charge a\nsubscription you can see everything that is available on the\nsite for free you just cannot post so it is just really\nimportant to us another analogy is going into a new relationship which is that if\nyou go into a new relationship thinking what\nam i going to get out of this it is\nprobably not going to work if\nyou go into a new relationship thinking okay this is a wonderful opportunity to give something to give love and\nthen maybe i will get love back but\nif you go looking for love because you need something it probably\nwill not work you need to flip it around in the way that i tried\nto describe a couple of minutes ago that is\nbasically the way that i think we both live our lives it is\nlike we are trying to give something and we are not trying\nto make ourselves be special it is just because it is a\njob and it needs to happen we are\nnot the only ones we are part of a huge team of people who are\ndoing this each in their own way this probably relates to your not having fear you do not\nexperience fear i wondered about that too you are in a field\nwhere it is very easy to get frightened and apparently you\ndo not feel that i\nthink that in a way if you can look at your own shadow you can\nlook at the shadow of the world and apparently that is what\nyou are very good at but is there a way in which your personal\nlives are being mirrored in the events taking place in project\ncamelot um i am not sure how to answer that i mean i am\nnot sure what the question is in a sense but in general i would say\nthat what happened with camelot is that we actually met each other as\nfriends and started on this journey and decided to do camelot \u201cjust\nlike that when we went to tintagel in england you know the home of king arthur we\nwere inspired by the idea of a round table in which there is no\nhierarchy everyone\u2019s equal there is no special person sitting at\nthe head of a round table you see it does not work like that we decided that was going to be sort of our motto for what we were\ncreating the other thing was that we had very little money and i\nhad this little consumer-grade camcorder that was going to be our\ninterview tool right so we both came from that grassroots idea and we stuck with it but it\nalso became all-consuming i have to say i reckon yeah or at least for the last maybe three years up to a certain point maybe more recently it changed but basically we would work all the time i mean like until eight or\nnine at night and if there was something going on then we would\nwork later you know it was the kind of thing where it is like\na start-up company in a sense it\nwas a labor of love we were involved in it all the time it is in\nevery aspect of our lives and this is still the case most of the\ntime about i do not know nine months ago then bill got in a relationship because we were both single also a weird thing that happened was\nthat when we formed camelot we did not have families and people\ndepending on us and all this kind of thing and children and jobs and so we were both totally free and we both sort of said i have got this skill-set he is got this skill-set what if\nwe put them together we\nboth wanted to see disclosure we both said what\nwe had like to see in the world let us create that yeah okay so we started out doing that we had no idea we had be\nsuccessful at it we did not even know what we were doing but\npeople and things it just came at us also we said oh let us interview dan burisch because people do not seem to\nunderstand what he is all about and we love well i love going into controversy so we just and you are quite successful at that but we did not know if people would say get\nout of here no i am not doing it who are you why should i\nlisten to you that type of thing but wildly we seem to disarm the people very easily and they invite us\nto their houses and they would tell us their stories then they\nwould break into tears and then you know bob dean i mean he\nnever broke into tears in his life in front of a camera until he was\nwith us oh gosh that is extraordinary i have to say that is a compliment you see because the trust\ngets established yeah but to answer the original question because i kind of diverged is to say that really camelot became 24 hours yeah we are running almost out of time i would like to ask\nyou the question what is the most extraordinary video or photo you\nsaw in your life oh i do not know what do you mean by extraordinary you mean\nsomething outside that we have not done like something that\ninspired us or are you talking about what we have seen and what\nwe have done what you have seen like from witnesses from other worlds or\nlike nasa pictures or of mars or have you ever visited an\nunderground base or seen some physical evidence of black projects or\nwhat something like that oh interesting hmm let me start while you think i do not know\nwhether you have seen these photographs yet have you seen the\nphotograph with the car being dematerialized yes yes that was quite interesting this was somebody who came up to us\nat a recent conference \u2013 he does not want publicity for this\nyet \u2013 with a series of photographs which showed very clearly a car disappearing into some kind of a portal all right in a whole series of events that he could barely understand he\ndid not want this information out because his colleague who was\nwith him at the time who actually took the photographs then\nreceived one of those \u201cvisits that you are not\nmeant to enjoy very much when he was in america ah but that is just a little i mean this is just one weird\nphenomenon that kind of thing probably happens in laboratories in\nlos alamos all the time as far as we know we have no idea but it\nwas quite fun to see it in a picture well i would say that i think it is called the sts 40 or\nwhatever there is a video out there sts-48 it was shot by nasa in which you actually see them shooting at you\nknow you see them fire at a ufo yeah yeah i would say that as far as all the footage i have seen all the\ncrazy photographs and i have taken photos of ufos too by the\nway okay it is on our site under shorts a lot of people do not see that but i interviewed it was one\nof my earliest interviews before camelot and i interviewed a lot of\nresearchers a lot of people jim marrs rich\ndolan and so on actually i knew to shoot at the sky i clicked pictures of a whole series of\nufos they made a design for me it is quite extraordinary if\nyou go to the site you will see it and then i did have that\nsighting\nin switzerland lake geneva this whole video is on youtube yeah yeah but i would say the sts them shooting because i think that that\nwas i mean there is evidence that there is something\ngoing on here between the earth and the beings out there and what\nthey think they are doing i\ndo not know how old that is but it is not from the fifties\nor something no that is 1990-something so they are still trying to shoot at things as much as with\nall due respect bob dean says we\nfound out we could not shoot at them we are still trying so maybe we are succeeding once in a\nwhile i really do not know but there is something going\non let me just add something as a\ncomment to your question about interesting videos or interesting\nphotographs people\nsend us photographs all the time some of them really are quite\ninteresting but i think that is not the point because in my\nopinion we are way beyond trying to prove to the world that\nthese phenomena exist i\nsay over and over again i love the analogy that we are like\nfishermen on a south sea island a little island and we catch the\nfish and we go in our boats and you know that is our world a\nlittle island we\ndo not think that there is anyone else in the world all we\nsee is the sea all around us we are the only people in the\nworld every\nnow and then we see a metal bird or somebody some crazy person says that they see a metal bird or some crazy person climbs a tree\nand says that they see a big metal ship on the horizon and everyone\nthinks that they are crazy then\nwe run around trying to prove whether these things are real or not it is like of course\nthey are real the\nreal questions are you know who is in that metal bird where are\nthey going and why are they flying over our island and what are\nthose people in that metal ship and why are they sailing towards us or why are they ignoring us or you know are they trying to help\nus are they friends are they people like us does this mean that\nthere are other people in the world is there another island out\nthere in the sea somewhere who knows there\nare much much much bigger questions rather than trying to prove\nthis stuff exists it is a given that these phenomena are real we do not have to prove anything it is like i do not\nneed to go out there and prove to you that there are cars in the\nstreet you know and i know i am very grateful you come from that place because that is\nactually what you can feel where you are coming from in\nthis work and that is very valuable in my opinion yeah and people send us photographs of look i just saw this thing in the sky and\nit is a little kind of thing you magnify it with all the little\npixels and you can see something it looks like a disk it is\nlike okay there are 50 thousand pictures like that we do not\nneed of course it is cool to have a picture but that is\nnot the point that is not the point i\nthink that that is where we are trying to take it there is this english phrase that is called \u201cpushing\nthe envelope we are not trying to analyze documents\nfrom you know is truman\u2019s signature on this 1947 document\nreal or not well there are people out there doing that and that is fine it is not to put that stuff down that is okay that is what they are doing yeah absolutely evidence is great in fact we were told by jake simpson he said do not ever take any\nhard evidence if anyone hands it to you because actually that is\nwhy you are safe in\nother words what we do is witness testimony okay we are not so\nmuch interested in documents you can fake photographs you can fake even photographs that are good billy\nmeier really has the corner on the best photographs probably in the\nworld still to this day and we believe billy\u2019s story okay we do not think he is a hoaxer for the record however we\ndo not think he is the only contactee out there either so\nthere are pictures and i think as time goes on we are going to\nsee more and more pictures i had love to have more pictures of\ndifferent beings and so on i think that is all wonderful it is\nlike they are\nthere they are out there in fact the truth is\nout there it is\nnot a problem you can get the truth all you have to do is know what\nresonates and you will be there and you can probably see it with\nyour own eyes from time to time it is our thinking that needs to change and then the truth will\ncome when we are ready for it so we are not trying to\nconvince anyone of anything we are not trying to present proof some\npeople write to us saying well how come this person says this and that person says that they cannot\nboth be right and\nwe say look we know\nthat that is not the point the\npoint is that we are trying to let me phrase this correctly we are trying to support people in their own growth process in\nbecoming more awake and more aware to change their paradigm to\nchange the way they look at the world to allow\nthese things to change so that this new world that we all want to\nexperience or that many people want to experience it starts in our\nown concepts it starts in the way that we see things what\nwe are doing is really trying to present a new way of looking at\nthe world it is a little bit like if you are zoomed very\nclose in on this object which is my hand and you are just a\ncentimeter away from it you do not know what you are\nlooking at you have got to step way back and then you see it is\na hand then\nyou pull back again and then you see it is an arm then you pull\nback and then you see that it is a body which is me then you\npull back again and you see us in this room then you pull back more\nand then you see amsterdam we\nhave to pull this camera back we have to zoom out really far what\nwe are trying to do is we are trying to encourage people to\nsee what we call the\nbigger picture the\nbigger picture involves other planets it involves what is\nhappening on this planet at a control level it involves other times it involves ancient civilizations it involves such a huge range of\nthings that if you look at any one of them too close you are\nnot going to see the big picture that is\nreally why we have gone after this breadth because the breadth\ncomes automatically when you pull back and see the bigger picture they go together yes that is really what we are trying to do so we are\nnot trying to prove anything we are trying to encourage people\nto look upon the world in a different way and\nthe people who thank us \u2013  this is my last word here\n\u2013 the people who write to us to thank us that is the\nenergy that keeps us going earlier on we talked about money mm-hm it is wonderful to receive a donation but it is even more\nwonderful to hear you\nknow what you changed my life that is\nthe energy that gets me up in the morning ready to work hard yeah i have to say that is true absolutely and the people who write to us saying look you changed my life they\ndo not say you\nconvinced me that this document was real or\nyou produced a really\ninteresting photograph they\nsay you helped me look on\nthe world and look on my place in the world in a different way now\ni see life differently that is\nthe important thing that is what is at stake here this is\nwhat we are trying to help people to do and\nall of us yourself included in this conversation and all the people\nwho laid on this conference that we have just been at yesterday and many other people who will watch this\nvideo and then pick up that\nball and run with it in their own way in their own mission in their\nown job because they are also special we are all part\nof a team here that is\nmy closing words there how about that beautiful okay yeah i would say that we are also presenting the\nevidence out there we are putting the testimony out there of\nhuman beings that you can watch and see and read their facial\nexpressions and really get into the emotion as well as the drama of this play that we are involved in here i\nthink that that is also the power of video yes very much in other words i do not think that we would in some\nways camelot came into being because of the power of video and the\ninternet and getting that out there in other words if you read the\ntranscripts i think you miss something it is\nreally vital that people begin to develop their own sense of knowing and you can only do that using all the senses okay so if you cannot\nbe here in the room with us we hope that whatever we convey on the\nvideo will be a great substitute for that such that you will be able\nto kind of go there and be there with us with the witness for your own discernment and i think that people do get that sense what happens is they need\nto develop discernment that is the key thing that i think maybe camelot can contribute to is laying it out there in such a way\nthat they begin to discern where is the person telling the\ntruth where is the person telling maybe the\ntruth as they know it but it might not quite be right or where is the person giving disinfo not because they intend because we do not think any of our witnesses are giving\nintentional disinfo but where are they actually selling something\nthat they have bought a bunch of false information on this\nis part of the big picture because there is a lot of falsehood out\nthere what happens is nobody tells the whole truth and nothing but\nthe truth because they do not have the whole truth and nothing\nbut the truth okay this\nis so multidimensional this experience we are having nobody knows it all truth on this level could be false on this level because you are\nnot seeing a whole lot of different things and as richard hoagland\nsays the lie is different\nat every level nobody knows it all it is too big no human being knows it\nall so this is why it is so important to have sort of the wide\nview yeah and i am very grateful that you give us the wide view in\na sense you are a vehicle to fine-tune everybody\u2019s own\ndiscernment on a much different level than we were able to do without\nyour work so i want to really thank you for doing that and putting your lives out\nthere on the line really great great work i\nhope that we will be able to enjoy much more of you and of the most\nbroad picture imaginable okay absolutely and that we will all see the day that we all know who we are where\nwe came from and where we are going to thank\nyou very much for this interview thank you that was a lovely ending yes that is a beautiful one music\nfades in]\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nkerry cassidy (kc so certainly the white hats have been behind the scenes working to make this\ndisclosure even possible in a sense our pete peterson is a white\nhat his background is ten years as a marine okay you wanted to say something rob robert fleischer (rf yes and\nthen i will give it over to dr o\u2019leary i just wanted to\nsay i mean i am the only german guy here you are\nmostly americans comments crosstalk responses laughter]\n\n\n\n\npaola harris (ph british nick pope (np british yes british i am the\nonly german guy i did not say i am the only non and\naustralian of course and british as well but this is like the\nanglo \u2013 how do you say the anglophobic world i think that there is a real chance\nfor disclosure when the anglo-saxon banking system goes down and i\nthink that there is a good chance that this can happen quite fast i mean all of the sort\nof debt of the united states is actually in the hands of the chinese and you have emerging states like especially the chinese the ah you have india you have russia and you have brazil so all of these countries they\ndeal with the ufo issue in a much more open way than the americans\ndo for obvious reasons i mean like in brazil they have open ufo\nfiles with ufo encounters in the jungle which is amazing in india they have the flying\nvimanas and it is part of their culture actually the flying\ngods that came from heaven and helped to create human culture so for them it is not such a big issue that there\u2019re\nextraterrestrials and just recently i talked to a\nchinese master of a spiritual ah a spiritual thing i do not\nknow how to describe it now in english anyway she told me that she\nknows that extraterrestrial contact is actually something considered\nofficial in china that there are university professors openly\ndealing with the content of what the contactees are being told by\nthem and how it all relates to quantum physics and stuff i think that this is actually a very\ninteresting thing and that this might emerge when we live not in a\nmono-polar world but in a multi-polar world which i hope will\nhappen soon excuse me for that i do not\nwant to offend you americans but absolutely you know in my sense i\nthink that is the best thing we can do to have a multi-polar\nworld and then i think disclosure will be much more likely than\nwhat we have right now now please brian o\u2019leary (bo\u2019l yeah i was just going to return to this issue of anger because i\nthink that is the largest obstacle to disclosure just in\ngeneral is how are people reacting or going to react to\ndisclosure bob dean (bd having been\nconned for so many years bo\u2019l having been\nconned for so many years and to my way of thinking this is the\nkind of anger management might be the right kind of approach for\nthis especially in america and i think you are right the\nmulti-polar world i think if america could recognize that a little\nbit more and kind of loosen up a little bit that maybe there is a\nway of slipping through this period which is obviously heads are going to roll there are going to be a lot of vindictiveness and anger and somehow that needs to be managed in a way that is for\neverybody\u2019s benefit and that is\nthe big issue you live out of the country at\nthe moment bo\u2019l yes so you may have lost touch\nwith a few things and i am not saying this in a negative sense i live in arizona and there is a\nrun on ammunition people are buying guns and ammunition in the\nsouthwest to such a level that the sporting goods stores and the gun\nstores cannot keep a stock on hand because the minute they get a\nshipment the shelves are cleaned out now this is the group of people\nthat i happen to know pretty well because i came from that group they are stockpiling guns they are stockpiling ammunition and when the word comes out how they have been conned and lied to for\nso long you are going to have blood in the streets and i think the obama crowd being\nsharp know this i do not believe that obama is going to let\nthis he does not want this on his plate right now because\nhe is got so damn many other things to deal with bill ryan (br steve what do you\nthink about when you start thinking about\nhow many people out there throughout the country are buying guns and\nstockpiling ammunition that is an indication that there is a level\nof frustration and anger out there in the american masses that the\npoliticians in washington may not even be aware of stephen talks to politicians\nall the time  do not you stephen stephen bassett (sb not exactly but one of my concerns here is we are about to go on the radio\nin a couple of minutes yep we will just continue\nas but i mean there is that audience is coming in right that is right so they do not know\nwhat is going on so i am going to make a very quick\ncomment because there\u2019re a lot of things i had like to\ncomment on but there is no antecedent for the audience i will\nhave to kind of re-up it but let me just say this this is very\nshort and sums up a lot of things i believe that the principle reason\nthat americans are experiencing so much angst and frustration cynicism and paranoia the principle reason that they are buying guns\nand/or expressing themselves in ways which are concerning is not\nbecause they have been told terrible truths but because they have\nbeen lied to extensively for the last well going back to the\nvietnam war primarily the gulf of tonkin resolution robbed robbed for god\u2019s\nsake and stolen blind so i sort\nof view it the other way if you want people to stop being paranoiac\nand stop being distrustful of the government and stop arming\nthemselves you need to start telling the truth if you start telling\nthe truth and things\u2019ll get better acknowledging the et presence is a\nbig big one and that\u2019ll get the ball rolling hopefully it\nwill lead to a \u2013 how would you say a reformist era where the truth becomes standard operating procedure holding back waiting  somehow\nkeeping the secret longer i do not think it is going to\nmake it any better it is only going to get worse and the last thing i will say is\nthis ets are not just here for the americans they did not\ncome all this way because this\namerica thing we got to tell them the truth right they are here engaging the entire planet we \nrepresent five percent of the world\u2019s population it comes down to this it does not\nreally matter whether the americans are ready or not or the\nbangladeshis or the french or the russians they are going to\ndeal with it whether they like it or not because it is going\nto happen whether they like it or not it is unavoidable and\ninevitable make a point stephen that the\nets are not visitors for god\u2019s sake well again i am they are not just visiting\nhere they have been\nhere from the beginning\nof our history but that distinction does not\naffect my political point well it ought to why i am talking about\nextraterrestrials in the sense of non-human beings as we understand\nthem with technology beyond what we have whether they are from the inner\nearth from another dimension from the past from other star systems\n\u2013 occam\u2019s razor would say from other star systems \u2013\nwherever they are from right it is a major event and a\nsignificant thing for the world\u2019s population to know this and\nthat crossing point when that self-acknowledgement occurs is a big\ndeal now the particulars we know\nthere is a huge sub-story here we know that behind this is a\nmassive story it is huge and broad and everybody is trying to\nunderstand it everybody knows a little about it a little here and\nso forth nobody knows the full story nobody\u2019s got it all\nright they know a little piece the dilemma is that the political\nprocess or the social transition is not about figuring the whole\nthing out and bringing it out to the public and saying here we cannot do that disclosure is nothing more than the\nfirst\nstep towards that process because once the governments formally\nacknowledge this reality and the schools can teach it and the\nphilanthropists can fund it and the media can cover it and the\nintellectuals can discuss it  then we can start sorting the whole\ndamn thing out and say this\nis nonsense that is not true this person\u2019s a fraud that\nperson\u2019s the real deal that story\u2019s good that story\u2019s\nbad and actually create a real history of this issue as best we can but until disclosure takes place that is not going to happen we are going to continue to\nchurn and churn and churn and remember that this arena this\nhall of smoke and mirrors we are in we did not build it \nthe government built it the government put those mirrors up put the\nsmoke in the hall they have deliberately made it very difficult if\nnot impossible to have a clear understanding that was a government\npolicy we have to end that policy and\ndisclosure is the end of that policy and that is disclosure\nwith a capital d a formal acknowledgement of the et presence that is it nothing\nmore disclosure with a small d\nhas been going on for a long time no question an unfolding of\ninformation citizen process misinformation all mixed in that is\nsmall d all right that is been happening absolutely no question but in spite of all that disclosure\nwith a small d do the universities teach it does the press properly cover it does\nthe government fund it do we have you know think tanks devoted to\nit no we do not what government does  matters what obama and the administration does  matters and so they have\nto act you cannot ignore government right you know people want peace and they\nsay well i want peace so the government does not\nmatter until the\ngovernment comes and takes your son or your daughter and sends them\noff to war what government does  matters so we have to engage it and we have to deal with the process using the\ninstitutions we have to get the proper result you all are aware of the\npandora\u2019s box\nstory the legend going back to ancient greece pandora\u2019s box\nhad all the furies in hell of the entire world locked and sealed you open pandora\u2019s box just a little tiny bit and all hell\nbreaks loose because you cannot release just a little tiny bit if you release just one little tiny\nbit you have got a million questions and a million pissed off\npeople wanting to know the rest of it and i do not believe that\nour government at this moment is in any position to even begin to\ntell them the rest of the story because do you know about the impact\non theology you know what the brookings report said you try to tell\nthe people out there that jesus of nazareth was one of them\n \u2013 and the evidence we have all had is yes he was now how do you\ntell that to fundamentalists excuse me look at the muslim world right\nnow the brookings report that was\nin 1961 or something 61 yes i mean now we have 2009 robert it is still\nnational as a kind of representative of the younger generation policy sadly enough okay okay okay maybe you\nknow in many generations \u2013 it is a problem for many\ngenerations obviously but i have to tell you i belong to a younger\ngeneration i know many people my age and younger for them it is\nnot so unimaginable it is not so when you say you\nknow the american government or certain people in the\nmilitary-industrial complex covered that up they say all right yeah yeah i\ncan imagine that you\nknow it is not a big deal for them okay let me hello hello hello let me interrupt we are going on the air bill are you\nannouncing are we on the air we should be on the air at the moment according to the time kerry and bill discuss computer\nsetup for radio broadcast]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  go ahead you guys let us\ncontinue this the younger generation you want to say something brian bo\u2019l yes what i wanted to\nsay is that it seems like that the problem you know we obviously\nhave a tiger by the tail here and that we all\nrecognize that anger is an initial reaction once disclosure really\nunfolds with a capital d so if we can recognize this and\nour so-called adversaries let us say\nthe keepers of the secrets can sit down at a table and negotiate the release of the information\nwhere in their perception it would not hurt them that much \u2013\njust maybe that is the opening it seems like that is the nub\nof the issue is that the cover-up and the encrustation of cover-ups\ngoing on for the last 65 years has created this pandora\u2019s\nbox which if opened could\nlead to a process of truth and reconciliation \u2013 which would just perhaps launch us into the new paradigm which is so badly\nneeded anyway in order to save our precious planet so that is the way i had\nlike to see it is to provide the basis for some sort of negotiation or process of truth and reconciliation to be able to create certain\nlevels of amnesty and you want us to forgive the\nsinners do you bo\u2019l well eventually yes paola harris (ph it is going\nto happen we do it all the time voi  yes i am sorry the filmmakers have something voi\n yeah i just have one thing that i want to put out there because we are\ntalking about two scenarios at a time because the real thing \nwhat is going on the cover-up i am afraid certain of the\nthird phenomena it is the counterfeit i mean the black\noperations the manifestations the false second coming the\nmanufacture project\nblue beam we are\ngetting to that actually yes voi  [continues speaking but is\ninaudible]\n\n\n\n\n  okay the filmmakers would like\nto us to address that yes that is important okay we are\ngoing there actually just so you guys know false yeah one of the yeah what\nwe are talking about here is when i said why\nnow part of the question\nis why now in this\njuncture and what is it as part of the possible agenda what these\npeople have in mind because they do not do things\nwithout sort of a self-serving angle involved and it may be that\nthey are preparing the groundwork for what will be a false alien\ninvasion scenario i will speak to this because i have actually been accused of playing a part in this oh great go ahead if you google the phrase\nfalse-flag alien invasion you will obviously as you are well aware find a lot of\nmaterial  quite a lot of it increasingly being pegged on 2012 which has been linked in specifically in some instances pegged on\nthe olympic games to be held in london and possibly some event\nsupposedly taking place at maybe the closing ceremony now my involvement with this is\nthat in amongst my freelance journalism work i have done i\nguess about two or three things which kind of went on the radar\nwith certain people if you will excuse the pun the first was i wrote an op-ed in\nthe new york times which went out under the title unidentified\nflying threats that went\nout i think on july 29th\nlast year a very interesting thing for the conspiracy\ntheorists was right underneath \u2013 if you are one of these\npeople who looks for juxtaposition of headlines \u2013 was an\nunrelated (or was it article entitled can\nobama handle the offense so\na lot of people read something into that i also do a lot of work with the\nsun britain\u2019s\nbest-selling national daily newspaper i worked on a story which\nwent out under the headline shoot\ndown the ufo that then got picked up by fox news\nand as some of you may have seen i was interviewed by bill hemmer\non that show two or\nthree months back so i am sort of sounding a\nlittle bit defensive here because when you mention things like blue\nbeam and false-flag alien invasion because of those media things\ni have done i have actually been put in the frame as one of\nthe guilty parties and i had like to absolutely assure everyone\nthat i am not you are innocent yeah i am innocent can i\nget back to a question which you asked about half an hour ago which\ni did not get to answer and i am going to give you an\nanswer sure absolutely you mentioned pete peterson who i do not know and have not met no reason to doubt his\nbona fides or anything but my personal answer to the question you asked of\npaola will this happen is no i say that for a boring statistical\nreason really but one that can be verified out of all the predictions of either\n(a some sort of landing or undeniable alien intervention or (b all\nthe predictions of disclosure out of all the ones that have been\nmade a grand total of zero have actually come to pass so just from a boring statistical\npoint of view i am reasonably confident that the deadline i\nthink you were saying november this year well actually we were saying\nend of the year it i think will come and go\nwithout incident can i pick up on point also that i\nthink bob made it is something that is been running\nthrough a lot of or all of us seem to leave out \u2013 lack of\ntrust in government i will just throw this out in a wider point\nof view something robert said that people\nof his generation if this was unpacked to them that they had\nbeen lied to would just say yeah so what we thought that was probably true these things were going\non we never did trust the government i am from the uk trust in\ngovernment in the uk at the moment on just about every issue is at\nan all-time low i do not know how many of the british news\nstories have made the media but our members of parliament have been\nmaking bogus claims for expenses and the most outrageous things that\nwe the taxpayers have been paying for some of them have resigned most have not just today it was announced on the\nnews possibly 100,000 cases of swine flu just in the last week according to some statistical analyses in the uk in the uk alone now that is\nat the high end of the estimate scale and estimates of deaths are\nabout 100 from that depending on whose figures you listen to my point is the other story that\ncame out today was that the help line which has now gone live \u2013\nthis is the government help line arguably one of the most important\nissues affecting the british people the people who are manning the\nhelp lines are not medically trained some of them were not even\ninterviewed for those jobs and guess what it does not matter\nanyway because the website\u2019s down because too many people are\ntrying to log on and get through so i think a lot of discussions i\nknow i have gone slightly off topic but actually you know i\nprobably have not because i think faith in government and\ninstitutions is at an all-time low so if it does transpire they have\nlied to us about this yes it is a massive lie but people\nwill not be surprised it cannot get any worse the point of pride let me remind you of something i know that in the uk they do not trust their politicians we\ndo not trust our politicians but your politicians caused a\nscene in 1776 and look what happened now that could tell you what\npoliticians screwing things up can do yes but \n\n\n\n\n  revolution in 1776 that spirit nick let me really tell you and let me reassert this that same damn spirit exists in the american people today and they\nare as capable in 2009 of doing what they did in 1776 that is\nwhat i am concerned about yeah i think that is\nimportant absolutely as a moderator i want to say here that\nthere is a youth and age part of this story because the anger i am going to say is in the people who have been around a\nlong time with the cover-up the youth have not okay at least not\nin this body and i want to say that anger is not\nso much an issue over this particular thing \u2013 the cover-up \u2013\nas it is that in a certain sense the youth will turn on a dime often will understand and they are being sold movies out there\nthat older people do not even go to i go to them so i know they are\nout there i know they have been taught a lot of information secret information in the guise of what looks like a childish story so i have to say that in some\nways it is true what you are saying rob it is not\ngoing to blow them away if some president gets up there and says hello et\u2019s real of course they are real that is going to be the attitude i know that would my attitude especially if i was that age and i\nknow that it is going to be true of a lot of kids but there is another side to\nthis and this is also valid and it is that there are americans\npreparing as we speak for the dissolution of what is in essence the american government okay that the cracks the ship is\nleaking and has been leaking for a very long time that patriots and\npeople that have come from the military are fed up that there is\na huge contingence of that going on and that this disclosure issue of\ntruths in general \u2013 that they have been lying on the money the financial end of things the society the way they have been\nbrought up the things they are supposed to do with their\nlives the paradigm the old paradigm is\ncrumbling and within the crumbling and the dissolution the\ncontrollers know damn well  if you just take one more thing and\ntip the straw off the camel\u2019s back \u2013 it is going to\nbe the disclosure issue in terms of ets there will be chaos they are\ncausing\nchaos in fact that is what they want i would suggest and you\ncan all address this if you will but they are not looking for\nthings to go smoothly right now actually they want chaos because\nthey want to eliminate a large number of the population and the\nviruses and the chemtrails and what is going on is\ncontributing to that go ahead our director of homeland\nsecurity recently went public on national media and expressed her\nview that the returning veterans from iraq and afghanistan are not to\nbe trusted because they know how to use guns and they are\ncoming back and they look around and they are pissed off now this woman used to be the\ngovernor of arizona she is now director of the department of\nhomeland security she went on national publication and said these\nguys are dangerous you know they know how to use guns and they are\ncoming back and they are angry well she touched the tip of the\niceberg let me tell you who the hell do you think are out there\nbuying the guns and ammunition a lot of them are the guys coming\nback from iraq and afghanistan well i have to say that well i should not name names but some of our whistleblowers\nhave actually said the exact same thing yeah well and they are themselves preparing let us put it that way i know that bo\u2019l and they are young\npeople well to me anyone under 50 is\nyoung you know but most of our whistleblowers\nare not young they are actually older than the age 50 are we on radio yet by any\nchance to\nbill] what is going on bill and kerry converse re broadcast situation bill confirms the panel is streaming live\naudio okay so let us continue\nwith this i would like to comment here because there\u2019re a lot of things being said that i do not\nagree with and i think i need to make a point lest i be accused of\nagreeing i am reminded of jefferson\u2019s\nquote that on occasion the tree of liberty needs to be fertilized with the blood of\nrevolution but that\nsaid i do not believe there is going to be a revolution i\ndo not believe there is going to be violence in the wake of\ndisclosure at all i do not think there is going to be a\nsubstantial panic i do not think anything\u2019s going to\nhappen in that regard as i have said i believe that\ndisclosure will be two things in one it will be the most profound\nevent in human history and it will be the most anti-climactic event\nin human history \u2013 thanks to 60-some years of information upon\ninformation and media and everything else i mean we have\nsaturated the world with this issue and the ets of course have\nhelped by constantly coming and going in the world today the most-known\nacronym is usa the second most-known acronym in the world today amongst everybody all six billion ufo everywhere and then the average population of iran thirty-three so look there is going to be\nsome angry people and there is going to be some people that\nhave grudges and there are issues to address but the first thing\nthat will happen with the acknowledgement of the et presence is the\nworld will want to know what why where and when tell me more tell me more the issues and the grievances will\nbe shoved completely aside and for the next\nweeks months or whatever there\u2019ll be some sort of\ninformation exchange the government is not stupid they are not going to come out initially with the stuff that is\ngoing to make them look awful and flammable some of them are i have\nmet them dammit other governments may choose\nto some of them are stupid because i have met them nick will tell you some of their\npoliticians are stupid well hopefully they will not\ndo that i would think that they will come out with those things\nwhich are relatively positive and reinforcing and over time we will\nget into some of the wilder and crazier stuff they have had 60 years to plan\nthis it is not going to be a random event unless the ets force\nit and i say this because look  i\nrespect all of my colleagues opinions believe me i respect\nbob tremendously but feeling as i do i do not want to be\ngoing to the public on the air and on radio and television and\ntelling millions of people there\u2019re going to be blood in the\nstreets there is going to be a revolution no i do not want to do\nthat to people either if i thought that by god i had\nsay it but i think we have to circumspect here because we are\ndealing with a profound thing i agree with steve there\u2019re a lot of reasons\nfor people being angry with government right now without any ets you still have lots of problems and we are going to still have\nthose problems the day after disclosure but ultimately when the\ngovernment starts telling the truth things are likely to get better and the last thing i will say is\nthis when the vietnam war ended one of the first questions that i\nthink was posed to the vietnam war activists was all\nof your anti-war stuff all of these years  can you tell us that you\nshortened the vietnam war by a single day and the answer is it\nwas not really clear may not probably did not and we are going to be asked\nthe same question you\nrattled our cages for all of these years did you bring disclosure\none day sooner than the government would have done it anyway and the answer is i\ndo not know very likely not but it does not matter because\nall of this has raised the public awareness and brought these issues\nout and spread them around the globe on the net and every way so\nhundreds of millions of people are getting a sense an understanding an awareness so when it does happen they are going to be a\nlittle more ready and if\nsome fool in some government somewhere says let us\ntake advantage of this big deal let us concoct something i\nthink if we get an alien war thing out there we are going to be\nable to spend trillions of dollars and i have got companies we\ncan fund i think the internet and you and\nyour colleagues are going to shred it in about 24 hours break it out\nin the open and these people will already be on their way to jail we are raising public awareness to\nget disclosure when it will happen hopefully soon but it is\nnot simply about disclosure it is about understanding okay we do not have enough jail\nroom to handle all of the government people like the guys in the\nhouse and the senate who should\ngo to jail we will put \u2019em in\nthe fema camps all right this is good energy let us let alfred have his say here i had like to jump in here\non a couple of points to make first of all to make the point of \u2013\nand raise the awareness \u2013 that we are talking about a\nplanetary issue and not an issue of the u.s and steve mentioned iran well it\njust so happened i want to make an announcement that i was contacted\nby iranian national television and they will be calling in tomorrow\nat 5 pm \u2013 i will take it on my cell phone \u2013 to\ninterview me on the subject of the extraterrestrial presence on the\nmoon so this is breaking through all of\nthe national stereotypes that we have if we look at the era that we are\nin it is an era of galactic consciousness and that is moving\nbeyond being spaniards or being americans or canadians and moving\nbeyond even being citizens of planet earth  to being citizens of an\norganized and populated galaxy that is where the leading edge\nof exopolitics is really now jumping to the second point this thing about the dissolution of the us  i can remember being a\nfuturist at the center for the study of social policy at stanford\nresearch institute in 1977 the same year that we were doing the\ncarter white house extraterrestrial-proposed study it was common parlance \u2013- in\nthe halls \u2013- of the plan to break up the us into five or six\ncontiguous regions washington and oregon was ecotopia you know and\nthere were various names for the other regions so i think that those of us who can\nappreciate that there are trans-national forces running some of the\nshadow government elements of the us the whole plan for the\ndissolution of the us now is really a trial balloon that has been in\nthe planning in the think-tanks for over 40 years oh\nyeah let us dissolve the us and you know we do a soviet union on it and then we go on to some other\nmarket i think i had like to really\nappeal to the patriotism of robert dean here and to what steven said\nthat on some esoteric levels the united states is supposed to be an\nexpression of the enlightenment kind of an inheritor of the enlightenment of the days when egypt and\nmars were one civilization \u2013 we have some proof of that now\nfrom the mars rover photographs so i would tend to resist\nidentifying with disintegrating the us now because i think it is\npart of a manipulation finally i had like to put my\nvote \u2013 i could be wrong \u2013 more on the 2002 roper report rather than on the brookings report that means that when queried 85 percent of people were completely congruent were totally cool with the specific question if\nthe government were to announce an extraterrestrial presence how\nwould you react and eighty-five percent said it would not bother\nme a bit i think that the opposite could be\ntrue and that is that there would be celebrations you have even\nactivists in our camp who talk about having rock extraterrestrial\nconcerts to welcome in this age it is kind of a falling of the\nberlin wall and it is more of a birth rather than a death of\nthe old system there is always been kind of a\nbifurcation in exopolitics which i think michael and paola and i\nwere talking about today that is do we focus on the short grays and\nthe reptilians and their reported plans for extermination of\ntwo-thirds of the human race with the h1n1 virus or some other\nvirus for which there is some possible evidence to start thinking\nthat way you know there is been\nresearch informally that has surfaced here that there may be negative\nextraterrestrial influence behind the chemtrails phenomenon which i\nthink has been mentioned in some contexts as possibly carrying a\nprecursor of the h1n1 virus or do we concentrate on the positive leading edge of the evidence that\nthere is a strategic alliance of ethical upper-dimensional\nextraterrestrials  the white\nhats  i think that\npeople were talking about i could easily see a scenario if we\nhave the government that has the courage to do it \u2013 and i do not\nknow whether the obama administration that has not been able to\nclose guantanamo which is a blatant war crime \u2013 could do that but they could spin it to say look for national security reasons we have maintained diplomatic\nrelations and we have had strategic alliances with the\nfollowing and for national security reasons we have had to\nwithhold that from you for 60 years for the following reasons and there could be plausible reasons\nthere including military attacks by the grays i think that a population would be\nmore in relief and celebration rather than reacting violently and\nwith despair alfred when the university of\nexopolitics is finally founded we are only going to let you\nteach the graduate courses bo\u2019l yeah i see what is\ngoing on right now is this two-edged sword there is on the one\nhand the perception that anger could be released that would obviously be a perception shared by those keeping the secrets then on the other hand a time of great celebration for the new paradigm i see it as a concomitant process\nthat both of the above will be happening and there will be a period\nof chaos it is a time of crisis and opportunity and a group\nlike this can mediate those discussions and bring it out into the\nopen i think steve\u2019s right\nwith his when what why\nkind of point you know in my experience of the media if an\nannouncement was made almost the very first thing is going to be what do they look like can we see a picture where do they come from what is their\nhome\nlook like we are not going to get into\nthese deeper issues before we have done the very basic tabloid\nstuff i agree with steve too i want\nto go on record as saying i will not buy into the anger everybody-shooting-each-other ridiculous scenario i think that people are\nintelligent and i think there is a third thing might happen some\npeople maybe do not care because i have spoken to a group of\npeople that just do not give a darn whether it is\nannounced it is not announced it is not going to affect\ntheir reality so it is not just rejoicing or let us\nrun in the street and kill people and be angry there is a whole level of\npeople that have told me frankly paola it does not affect me at all and we have to remember those people well paola this probably\nis not the right thing to say to you but maybe this is a good\ntime to quote john alexander oh yes i know what you are\ngoing to say now yes did not he say you know did not he end a presentation with all this talking about\ndisclosure and say well joe blow joe six-pack whatever his question is does any of\nthis mean i do not have to go to work tomorrow actually that is the\npoint it does it quite possibly could mean that and that is actually getting\nto the root of the matter what you are talking about is a\nrevolution in a paradigm it may not mean blood in the streets exactly but it could quite possibly mean a rebellion in\nconsciousness that results in people becoming co-creators of this\nworld in a conscious way such that they do not go to work\ntomorrow because they realize that one of the things that comes out\nof ufos is free energy it opens up that\npandora\u2019s box such that the possibilities because the ets\ncome from a very advanced scientific future and that much is\nobvious they are visiting us they are dealing with our\ngovernment the government\u2019s been dealing with them this is\nthe other side of that story is what\ndoes it mean for us and certainly in the eyes of the\npowers that be will disclosure happen because what it means is\nthat it is a relinquishing of power on a certain level if they\nare not in complete control of this world because they do not\nhave the highest technology the highest intelligence  they are\nnot the man on top anymore okay then who is on top and that\nbecomes the question so maybe joe six-pack does not\nrealize that right off but maybe he does maybe on a subliminal\nlevel he realizes the controllers are not in control that the game\nhas changed that it is thrown wide open and that all things\nare suddenly possible and that we can rework this thing and we can\nalso take down the as john lennon would say that there\nare no countries anymore that there are no borders\nanymore and that we are\nhumans \u2013 all of us we are united  all of us that we are one\npeople and that these aliens  who look like us  may be our\nbrothers and sisters and fathers and ancestors whatever you want to\nsay it changes the entire paradigm in\nevery way it is like the cards where does the expansion end and these are the possibilities so what i would say is that let us\ntalk about once you open the door of\ndisclosure there is a sense in which pandora\u2019s box will open and there is no limit to the questions that can be asked not just\nthe people  like this in this room  will be asking those\nquestions but that average people will be i think that we need to kind of\nopen or expand the vocabulary because we are kind of assuming\nthat there is going to be a transition from secrecy or denial to\ndisclosure i think actually we are missing an intermediate\nstep which is openness there is going to be a transition from\ndenial to openness and after we have have openness for a few\nyears then we will have disclosure at the secret un meetings that i\nmentioned that occurred in february last year one of the things\nthat had been agreed upon by the national delegates that were\nattending was that beginning in 2009 they would begin a process of\ninternational openness on these issues when you look at what is been\nhappening over this year it is like well what we are\nseeing is not so much disclosure what we are seeing is\nopenness we are seeing files being released we are seeing\nthe media tackling these issues in an objective way now i think that is how you will prepare the groundwork for disclosure maybe in\n2011 or 2012 so i think we need to kind of\naccept that the people that are moving forward are very rational they are not going to try to panic people they are going\nto try to prepare people through a very-well-thought-out process of\nreleasing more and more stuff getting universities to deal with\nthese issues in a systematic way there are a lot of researchers\n now turned to journalists  being allowed\nto do this work exactly so i think we are\ngoing to have this process of openness maybe for two years three\nyears accelerating and then eventually we are going to have\ndisclosure what you are saying like at\nthe end of this year 2009 you know by just releasing this\ncongressional research report that is not so much disclosure because they did not find the answers for carter but what they\ndid was they prepared him for this\nis what might be going on so there is an openness process\nat work here and i think that is what we are now witnessing and are\nin the midst of well if they think they can\nstretch this out for three more years my hat\u2019s off to \u2019em\n but i will take the bet right i mean what was that phrase if you want to make god\nlaugh tell her your plans right several voic  right yeah right they have had 62 years to\nplan out something right so this idea okay now we will go through enlight you know nah i do not think so but let me comment on something\nthat kerry said because i am going to get into this a little\nbit on sunday without getting into the outcomes predicting any\noutcomes i do believe \u2013 and i am speaking from a more\nnuts and bolts sense \u2013 i have this hunch that disclosure media\npresence will trigger very possibly the greatest era of reform in\nhistory going back to the sumer to the flood in other words it is going to\ncreate a kind of cascading effect in which because of the fact that\nthe world\u2019s attention will suddenly be focused pretty much in\nthe same direction through billions of eyes focusing in the same\ndirection then everything sort of is tossed up in the air everything goes on the table suddenly \u2013 which happens once in a\nwhile that the reformist movements that\nare out there \u2013 and there is reformist movements\neverywhere right you just do not hear about them but they are\nout there struggling along working out of their basements \u2013\nwill suddenly be given life and energy and money and you are\ngoing to see literally a systemic i think spectral reform that\nwill be staggering in its size and scope now will it lead us to wonderful\nthings will it all work out will it be like the french revolution \u2013\nyou start off with a good idea and the next thing you know you are\nlopping heads i do not know but i know that the opportunity is\nthere and for me that is one of the reasons to keep going and\ndo this it is not just oh they will tell us the ets are here we have a world that has basically\nbeen shoving stuff under the rug for a couple of centuries \u2013\nputting things in the closet sticking them in the attic not taking\ncare of business not dealing with what has to be done \u2013 and\nthat was going to catch up with us i think this is the trigger that\nsuddenly says okay we have\ngot to clean out the basement clean out the attic we have got\nto cut the lawn we have got to take care of business we have\ngot to clean up the secret empire we have got to start filming\nthe bilderberg meetings we have got to toss the skull and bones\nidiots off the yale campus we have got to do a lot of\nthings we need monetary reform we need doctrinal reform in the\nchristian church the islamic faith we have got to take care of\nstuff because a lot of stuff is stupid right it is\nridiculous but we are locked up after the last few thousand\nyears we are just completely all locked up and cannot\nmove and so you go to the congress for\nsome simple thing and the congress is going i\ncannot move and you\ngo to the islamic faith and say look we need a little change here we are going to have a world\nthreat  \u201cwe cannot act catholic church cannot change its policy on birth control we\ncannot get anything done all of a sudden \u2013 boom  into\nthis comes the biggest event of all time so what happens after\nthat is up to us i just look at my job as trying to help people look\nand see and maybe be part of the post-disclosure world but we hopefully earned our right\nto be on stage hopefully we have earned the right to be heard\n but not necessarily so the mainstream may come and say look you guys have been\nbugging us about this for 20 years yeah you were right now go\naway we hate you right we have got\nphds from harvard and yale and i have been working with the\ngovernment for 40 years and i really know all about this stuff you-all go away we may have to stand together hard because the mainstream will want us to go away we are going to\nhave to fight for our post-disclosure opportunities and positions which is why i hope that the tensions and disagreements that exist \nparticularly between the exopolitical field and the old guard\nufological field  do not get worse is this thing worth addressing\nhere oh yeah sure it could be worth addressing but could i add something to that i was told by people in the\nintelligence community when they tried to hand the phone over to\npaul hellyer ex-minister of defence because they were going to talk\nto him about keeping quiet you know paul hellyer ex-minister\nof defence read corso is book that this was a very serious\nsituation we needed to deal with we were in hawaii and the phone was\ngoing right across me and they said to me paola you people do not know what you are doing we have got it\nhandled who said this to paul the intelligence community i\ndo not want to mention the names but they were people that i\nknow that are working on that side of the fence in the ufo question right they are very well-known people\nand their connection with money and so forth and when they tried\nto hand the phone to paul hellyer and i would let the phone go by i\nsaid he is on his\nhoneymoon you cannot talk to him\n\u2013 they said to me paola you people are amateurs you do not know what you are talking\nabout we have it handled now the words we\nhave it handled and my\nbrain was going what do\nyou have handled who do you think you are dealing with yeah they have it so\nwell-handled that we have two fine trade center buildings in new york\njust standing tall there you can go see them right now and so he never got the phone\ncall that time he got it later because they wanted to make sure\nthey told him to calm down and stop speaking okay but i have a question\nhere i have a question that is going to blow this thing wide\nopen uh-oh actually it is\ntwo-pronged but one what if disclosure is the only thing\nthat can happen prior to a real\ninvasion scenario that is been going on while we are here\non the planet the whole time then it would be a what if and it what if the days are numbered\nfor that scenario that is real \u2013 i am positing it as\nreal and what if there is only as our recent witness is saying there is only about three years left on this planet before  if\nwe continue at the rate we are going  there is no i\ndo not know oxygen the whole thing is trashed now what if we are actually\nliving a timeline that does not just go out stretching out\nthere for all these different educational processes to take place but we have actually reached a kind of end game in which\nhumanity has no choice that a choice has to be made and some people\nhave decided they are going to make that choice for us what if well kerry everybody has to\ndie i would rather die knowing the truth of this world than die\nwith a head full of government lies that is a good okay i am saying\ndisclosure happens disclosure is happening it is happening\nright here today  but what i am suggesting is something that\nhas not been talked about and is never talked about okay we have a false-flag alien invasion on the one hand that the government because i do not know\nif people out there have seen my video sighting that i had at lake\ngeneva you know one night of this gigantic\ncraft that was clearly at least to me being driven by not only our\nguys but maybe a couple reptilians at the helm so to speak i mean what you have to deal with\nis that we may be reaching according to the whistleblower that we\nstarted this whole conversation with positing that obama\u2019s\ncoming forward with this information on top of it that same guy who is an insider with what he says is a higher clearance than\npresidents okay his access is higher than the president today and he is saying number one prepare number two you have\ngot no idea what the real story is that it is not even being talked about  even in our circles we still have not gotten\nto the very bottom of the story it involves things like race like a\nwhole huge slew of robots okay it involves travel outside this\nsolar system that we have been involved in \u2013 we the government it involves so many different\nlevels to say they have\ngot it handled well they just might and what they have got handled is not\nnecessarily something in our favor you know i know we are\nlaughing and there is possible and there could be a lot of different levels there is a\nfalse-flag idea but there are agendas at work here and there may be\nthings that have not been dreamed of here in your philosophy and i have to say that \u2018henry\ndeacon is sitting out there in the audience and at any time\nnow because you have a certain\ndegree of knowing you are welcome to join us here but what was drilled into \u2018henry\ndeacon from day one once he joined these black projects was we are the wolves and they\nare the sheep okay there is a sensibility about a perception about an attitude that goes behind that and that is\nnot to do with being a member of the\nunited states \u2013\nit is being a member of a secret government that is\nworldwide and has an agenda okay and is teaching their military\nemployees a certain line of reasoning that has to do with we\nhave no choice it is on the georgia\nguidestones we plan to\nmake this earth a better place and the way we have going to do\nthat guys is to eliminate whatever two-thirds of the population it is a plan it also has to do with their\nrelationships with these ets that we are saying we know are\nhere but deals have been made deals\nin our name have been made on the good side with the good guys and\non the bad side with some of the bad guys \u2013 if the information\nthat we at camelot have been getting is true so i am just throwing this open\nto make it a little bit wider a little bit more outrageous and just\nsee what yeah i thank you for widening\nour concept i really think this is what exopolitics is all about to bring this back to the topic at\nhand which is disclosure there is a way that the disclosure\nmovement is the modern abolition movement by which slavery was\nabolished in the united states by a movement an abolition movement which started in the uk which then went worldwide i mean we are\nstill feeling the effects of it fundamentally the disclosure\nmovement should be a movement to free us the slaves from our\nmetaphysical slavery at being denied the true concept of what is\ngoing on and at stopping any plans for our projected demise because\nwe are free and sovereign souls on this planet in this dimension and citizens of the galaxy and no other sovereign has the right to\ndeny that to us so the disclosure movement really\ntakes on and has to take on the moral force and breadth of the\nabolition movement that in centuries past abolished physical\nslavery this is \u2013 we are talking about consciousness\nslavery so i really support your bringing in that wider concept of\ndiscussion i second that in this regard and i have been talking about this of late i believe that \u2013\nand hegland talks about this the presidential candidate that split\nthe tm movement \u2013 i believe that the suppression of reality\nfrom the citizens by the state \u2013 meaning telling you that say the sun actually goes around the earth and not the other way\naround \u2013 is in fact a violation of natural law it violates a\nfundamental law it is beyond the law of the state now what do i mean by that i think\nyou would agree that if any nation any country were to say pass a\nlaw in their legislature that you could murder anybody you wanted to\n\u2013 meaning just kill somebody it is okay it is\nlegal \u2013 that they would say no no whatever your constitution whatever that violates a fundamental\nnatural law that is beyond the law of man in a sense and you\njust do not do that well i think this is also true so\nthis violation of actually denying the reality to the people there\nis no law that can justify it there is no law that man could pass\nthat can justify it so we are really dealing with\nsomething at that transcendent level and as long as that is the\ncase it is virtually a toxic poison that just seeps down and\ncorrupts everything everything you can think of so it has to end i do not\ncare what the what-ifs\nare it does not matter it simply has to end right and once\nit is ended once that denial of reality is ended we will try\nto deal with what-ifs in the best way we can voice from audien unclear lots of echo] the\nsecret and join once together and bringing the values the\nufo issue there is no the secret continues unclear] why\nare the governments keeping secrets from the public this is a voice from the\naudience could you tell us who you are because you are not on\ncamera voi  what i think you have to repeat the\nquestion voi  [lots\nof echo barely audible it is not easy in\nevery country in the world they are going to camera pans to man holding paper\nsign up to panel]\n\n\n\n\n  stop the secrecy top secret oh i see the that is very nice voi  there are people alex\njones\u2019s people and my people have a lot of help  and\nall are focused on the secrets so that we have to go to the point in\nwhich denying the states to keep secrets from the public in this\nmoment we can join all the different movements that are fighting in\nits own fight and we can all together the world united in\ndemonstration that is what i ask of you all to\nhelp make a world demonstration in which the public the humankind denies to the governments to keep secrets from them continues unclear lots of echo] and then there is disparity all yeah for the sake of the\ncamera please tell us who you are nobody knows who you are voi i wrote a book\ncalled extraterrestrial and all the information they gave to me i am a sort of you but now say in spanish the thing that you have to hear us\nalso because it is not as you said something from the usa you are not going to win this fight alone absolutely that is why we are\nhere voi  we are going to win all of us together all of humankind and the thing there are people who do not\ncare about the rest of us who do not care voi  they do not care but how can we approach to them because we are in a higher position we\nhave to approach to them not them to us so we go to alex jones and\nsay ok what we have in common\n what secrets do the\ngovernments have the right to keep secrets from the public above all this\nis the reasoning for me if something is good why keep it secret you only have secrets when it is bad no if it is good be transparent be clear no okay now that was my point and now\nmichael has to leave michael has to leave we invite\nyou to have a\nlast word i do not think it is going to be the\nlast word but it is an opportunity for you to say your piece\nhere before you have to leave but i have the feeling that this\nconversation is going to continue for a while what you have got an\naudience with the king by any chance michael there are a lot of people\nlistening on audio now well i want to emphasize again\nthat as far as the united states is concerned because it is the\nmost powerful nation when it comes to managing the extraterrestrial\nsecrets that there has been a fundamental struggle between on the one hand trans-national\norganizations and actors \u2013 and the neoconservative agenda\nduring the bush administration was one of the focal points of that \u2013\nand the constitutional forces in the united states government the\nso-called white hats people associated the navy and the other kind\nof loyal constitutional forces now 9/11 \u2013 september 11 2001\n\u2013 was i believe the first in a series of false-flag attacks\nwhich would culminate in something along the lines of an alien\ninvasion i think it was the first of many and\nthe reason it did not occur was that the constitutional forces were\nstrong enough to prevent the trans-nationalists from moving forward\nwith this sequence of false-flag events that would culminate in a\nnuclear attack in the united states and then an eventual false-flag\nattack which would create a chaos around the world with the obama administration i\nthink what we have now is that there is an ascendancy of the\nconstitutional forces so i am far more optimistic that\nthe transition to disclosure is going to be much more harmonious much more thought-out in a way where the public is properly prepared so that when the truth finally does emerge \u2013 whether it is\nat the end of this year or in three years time \u2013 that\nit will be done in a way where we can all be confident that there is\nnot going to be two-thirds of the population wiped out in some kind\nof cataclysmic attacks that are false-flag operations but a much\nmore positive and harmonious transition so i will leave on that very\noptimistic note thank you sir well done brian o\u2019leary bo\u2019l i was going to say that\ni live in ecuador and the government of ecuador well actually the\npeople of ecuador just ratified a new constitution and in the\nconstitution \u2013 and this is unprecedented as far as i know \u2013\nis that nature has rights and although it has not been enforced\nyet it is going to natural law natural law is becoming more and\nmore of an inspired common denominator of the world community and\nthat is really good news because the opposite extreme is the\nagenda of black ops so i think places like ecuador\ncould become a kind of a world focus of what alternatives can happen now the government of ecuador is also kicking out the u.s air\nforce the manta air force base at the end of this year and these\nare all positive signs that the imperial powers the secrecy the\ntrashing of the earth \u2013 that it is beginning to unravel and so\nnatural law i think needs to kind of dictate the future agenda this gentleman made a comment i\nwant to comment on very quickly he pointed at something which is\nvery important there are right now around the world\nand in the united states many many activist movements trying to get\nat fundamental government lies of some kind or another \ninstitutional lies but by and large none of these movements are\ngetting anywhere the secrecy reform is one of the least funded of\nall but they are all passionate and they want to get forward the et issue is because of its\nincredible profoundness has got the potential to break through and what happens if we break through that window that door these other\nreformist operations and secrecy movements are going to be able to go\nthrough and start working to resolve their issues in other words it is like somebody breaking through the line and everyone\nfollows behind them that is non-trivial there are many many lies many\ngovernments out there that have created false realities and the\npeople have a chance to maybe deal with that finally but we will\nbe kind of the point of the spear if that is the way it is \nthat is the way it is but i try to keep that in mind i have tried to network with some of\nthese other groups some are environment some are in peace landmines whatever but because of the stigma of the ufo thing they do not want to sit and break bread i understand that voi  it is about how\ncan we approach the it is not easy but it is\ngetting better you know and we may start to see more collaboration but probably we will see disclosure first paola once disclosure comes i\nthink all of us are going to be very popular and people will want to\ncome and talk with us and we can network and we will hopefully help\neach other out that would be nice i agree with what he says as\nfar as i remember during the vietnam war the native americans took\nover wounded knee we had a lot of other groups come through and\nthere was change in society over the vietnam war question if you\nremember the native americans took up and did the same thing however this is a discussion that is\na part of what we have been talking about there is a chapter in\nmy new book all of the\nabove called alien\nracism i have made so\nmany mistakes because i do not know who is visiting us i do\nnot know where they come from and i have no idea how they think because they are alien and one of the problems i have\nhad with all of my stories is that i have interviewed people like dr michael wolf whose contact was a gray but it was a baby gray cult it was not the gray there are several types of grays that particular gray was a positive gray it was from another place and i have interviewed people who\nhave been contacted by different races that appear ugly and i do not think that we have the time to say this\ngood bad evil or\nwhatever i was very embarrassed by something\nthat happened to me i was talking about the reptilians over dinner\nwith some native american people and one of those women was a\nshaman she was a medicine lady and she said how\ndare you she said our\nancestors were the serpent people and they carried the knowledge she said the serpent\npeople from our ancestors were not evil and they were very wise\npeople and she said to me quetzalcoatl\nis called \u201cplumed serpent in mexico a lot of cultures have\nthese serpent people and\nwe just called all reptilians evil i had like to know how they\nwould think of us if we are on another planet they show some\npictures of us and say these\npeople are evil they are pedophile they have sex with their\nchildren these people are good because these people are tibetan what they do is they are tibetan monks and they meditate all day these judgments on these races of\naliens cannot be made just like this good bad reptilian gray blondes\n\u2013 because maybe some of the blondes and some of the\npleiadians who are coming here are not exactly positive so in my\nchapter i say it is\naccording to the agenda of the race \u2013 why they are here some of them are here maybe for\ntheir agenda  like hybridization because they need survival and\nthey are using our egg and sperm because they need to survive for them that is good for us that is not so good they\ndid not ask permission but you know let us look at this\nbefore we go and brand reptilians blondes and nordics are good colonel corso told me there were 57\ndifferent races of aliens and just from paola i have to say\naliens for me are alien i have no idea how they think i do not have any idea why\nthey are here and i am not going to take the government\u2019s\ntestimony as gospel as to why these people are here and when we get as angry as i have\nheard us be let us remember that there\u2019re whole groups\nthat are here that are spiritual light-beings they are\ninterdimensional they are also inspiring us they are spiritual\nlight-beings that are not i do not know why we call them\naliens they are just beings they are souls from other\nplaces why do we brand those people aliens they are giving us inspiration every day to go and do things and whether they appear as light whether they appear as people whether they appear whatever to me i still think we need to be\ncareful about alien racism and putting that out there because people\nare going to be afraid and then i had an indian shaman lady saying watch what you say about\nthe serpent people i had like to support that\nwith a piece of second-hand testimony that i can report from barbara\nlamb who is done a lot of work with experiencers i met her at\nthe conscious life expo in los angeles this february she told me a personal story about\nhow a reptilian had appeared in her room out of nowhere had held\nher hand and looked her in the eye for two minutes and communicated\nwith her that he had been bred to communicate with certain people to\nspread the message that they are not all bad and that is very very interesting to me we have to be careful because\nthe ufo community is putting everything in boxes this\nis the way it is and\nthis is the way it is and\nthis is because it is convenient\nfor us to well we are human that is\nwhy we do that that is right we are\nalways judging and we are always putting things in boxes and the\ntruth might be much more complicated than that i think it is very\ncomplicated well it is very complex and\nthank you paola i believe that that is something that actually in the community \u2013 if you want to use this in a very loose\nsense \u2013 that there are all different kinds of beings that\nthat is really what we are talking about and widening the\nperception of the kinds of beings and the multi-dimensional nature of\nall of life us included that is what we are here\nto talk about that is what we are opening the doors to what happens is  you are right when it gets to sovereignty that is one of the most important aspects of what we are\ntalking about here what we are talking about here\nis a transition that we are going through humanity and the\nplanet in fact possibly the galaxy galaxies are all in a state of\nevolution ets included okay ets interdimensionals you name it they are all spirits inhabiting bodies inhabiting light bodies if you will it just depends we are all spirit so at any rate what brian\u2019s\nsaying is also valid in other words this is gaia this earth and\nwe need to actually protect her allow her to thrive and this has\nbeen held in slavery for too long okay this being this whole being\nwe call the earth is a being so actually you know it is a\nmovement towards freedom of breaking the chains it gets that wide but it is also a question to be asked of every you know visiting even people that are here even subterranean beings we are talking about is\nthe earth and is humanity allowed sovereignty are\nwe each individually allowed sovereignty to grow and thrive to the\nbest ability that we have to do so and can we\nassure\n[or\nshow that we are capable\nof it we are doing so at the\nmoment i would surmise but you know what we are saying here\nis basically that some of these beings are coming here with an\nagenda just like some of the controllers so-called whatever you\nwant to term these people they are not alien they are us okay nonetheless they have chosen to control and we have given them that\nability to control we are taking it back slowly but surely that is what it is all about is taking back\nthe control of our own sovereignty and saying no enough you will not make decisions for us we are co-creators and\nwe are going to do this together but not to also allow more advanced\nraces to take us over to determine our path etcetera etcetera so there are many levels to this exopolitical view of how we are\ndealing with this future that we are fast approaching i was going to say that i am\nthinking that we need to wrap this quite soon because otherwise we\nwill not have anything to talk about this weekend and\nthis is the start of a conversation rather than the finish of one i was going to propose that alfred as the founder of the term exopolitics might usefully be able to make a little final summation if such a\nthing is possible and then we can continue this conversation\nelsewhere and else-when well i will attempt one but i\nwill be very humble i think that what we have touched in\nthis conversation really is a reflection of the multi-dimensionality as you were saying of the multiverse reality in which we live and exopolitics as a social science\n\u2013 the science of relations between our human civilization and\nother intelligent highly intelligent civilizations in the\nmultiverse \u2013 can serve as an interface we were all able to\nencapsulate and hold this entire conversation within the discipline\nof exopolitics as we would have within the discipline of\nanthropology were we studying some tribe that we had discovered on\nan island so i want to thank you for advancing\nthe discipline in this conversation and we look forward to many more\nin its evolution steve i do not want to not\nwrap it \u2013 but rather i want to put something on the record since we are on camera that i think is important i should have\ndone it sooner forgive me namely this that the umbrella of\nexopolitics allows us to engage a much broader almost infinite array of issues of past present and future without question and\nthat is where i want to be but i think we must remember that\nall of us stand on the shoulders of a group of individuals who plowed\nthrough this issue starting in the \u201940s from primarily a pure\nresearch kind of forensic approach \u2013 scientific \u2013\ncreating organizations and doing research and sighting reports and\nwhat have you and they had to do this during the\nheart of the truth embargo when the government was absolutely\nopposed in every way to this going forward it was brutal it was\ndifficult and many of them have not live to see this kind of\ndiscussion we just lost such a person recently just a few days ago \u2013 richard hall legendary researcher \u2013\ndied others are going to die as it happens \u2013 and this is\nnot surprising it is happened before \u2013 as we transition\nfrom the ufo research era to the exopolitical era very serious\ntensions have developed between these old-guard researchers and the\nexopolitical activists and what have you they are not\nfoundless there are reasons for it and they need to be appreciated\nand they are growing i wanted to be clear that i for\none know that without them i could not be doing what i am\ndoing and i have every intention as this goes forward i have been graced with the\nopportunity to do lots of media and get out there okay fine but as\nthis thing culminates and we move past disclosure i have every\nintention to do everything i can to ensure that these researchers these founding fathers and mothers of ufology are given the credit\nthat they deserve that they are able to participate in\nthe post-disclosure world and not be shut out by a bunch of smart-ass\nscientists from harvard that just got religion that they will be\nrespected and honored this is important and i want to put that on\nthe record thank you hear hear wonderful that is\nright we are standing on the shoulders of giants here there\nare a lot of very brave men one of the names that immediately\noccurred to me when you say that of course is donald kehoe yes sure and his whole they were\nheroes all kehoe hynek mcdonald mcdonald but there\u2019re a\nlot of them berliner and ah it is a huge list oh god i am sorry the\nname escapes me but there are plenty still alive yeah dr john mack john mack yeah absolutely we have got a\nbunch of them that we pay tribute to on the camelot site and there\nare many more who we may never even know about it is a team\neffort and many of these people who have gone before us and i\nhope that not too many will have to go after us because with a\nlittle bit of luck we might be able to wrap this thing up between\nus there are people all over the world many different countries many nationalities people of different\nexperience different color we are all working together on\nthis because this is about the human race and this is a thing that\nwe have to work together on i wish there was a way to\nreconcile that we all get together on the same page but i think it is just the nature of things that that is not probably\ngoing to happen but it will not hurt if when we have the\nopportunity to acknowledge them the best we can i think that will\nhelp and we will see where things go voi  in\nrelation\nto\nmany of my people in this conference because there are not there is an issue of getting my people i think that gary\nmckinnon i do not know the person gary mckinnon oh gary mckinnon voi we have to somebody to say\nsomething you think somebody\u2019s\ngoing to mention the gary mckinnon case well gary mckinnon has been\ngetting voi agreement probably well we interviewed gary\nmckinnon and you certainly are welcome to view his video on our\nwebsite he is getting a lot of attention in the uk he is\ngot a lot of well-known musicians now backing him there have been fairly successful\nmoves to keep him from being extradited from the uk to the us to\nstand trial whether or not that will ultimately be successful i\nthink there is a final ruling coming through actually in the next\nweek or two i was told so i do not know where that is\ngoing to go they have put through a number\nof different defenses for gary we at camelot were consulting behind\nthe scenes on that however i have to say that gary\nmckinnon and his group decided in terms of defending him not to\nraise the real card that he holds which is that he found evidence of\nfleet-to-fleet transfers and off-planet non-terrestrial officers\nthat indicated what we know of as the secret space program and\ntherefore they decided not to use that in his defense okay that was\npretty much pushed to the side they are using another defense that\nwe at camelot did not recommend but we wish him the absolute best he is a brilliant musician i have to say if you have not\nheard his music i encourage you to do so but on top of that he is also\na brilliant mind and he did come across some very interesting\ninformation when he did his hacking and he was very na\u00efve he\nwas incredibly brilliant at the same time as being na\u00efve but he is being used as a scapegoat by the powers that be what he could have done was to\nactually take this issue that we are all discussing right here\nand now into a courtroom which might have resulted in disclosure on\na whole different level but at the moment it does not appear\nthat is going to happen okay now whether he will be saved\nbecause he went this other route i do not know but in answer\nto your question that is the story with gary mckinnon voi  well i want to ask to make\na mention of him and this issue i am sure david griffin is\ngoing to mention him he is exopolitics united kingdom i think he is\nspeaking on sunday voi  because i think we have to\ntake him as our hero and as the proof why is he still in jail if he\ndid not find anything so show a reference to him and the government we can do that and we just\nhave voi\n\n\n\n\n\n  well we are going out\nover the airways we just have voi  \nman has the right as \nhis own self the right of humankind of knowing these secrets yes that is right but he is one of many\nheroes this is the point br yes yeah voi meet all together\nin two hours make a short statement and there is\ngoing to be a lot of press conference here\n\n\n\n\n\n  we are happy to raise it\ntomorrow in the press conference we are happy to do this we will\nraise the gary mckinnon story well the press can raise it let them ask voi  do not talk by\nyourself as media as a group okay let us meet all together\nand say we are going to say something about gary mckinnon and he\nrepresents humankind and wants to know this kind of secret desire to know the truth gary mckinnon is not going to\nbe extradited the obama administration has no desire to do that the\nreason they have not done anything immediately is because it\nwould look awkward it is like a matter of priority of issues\nand so but it is inconceivable to me that it will happen but of course he has gone through\na lot but that said i for one do not support or encourage\nanybody to hack into government computers for any reason right it\nis a form of civil disobedience if you do it be prepared to pay the\nprice voi  why not they hack into\nours and they should pay the price\nfor that right voi continues\ntalking unclear other voices overlapping]\n\n\n\n\n  let us see there is\na saying and somebody if i get the quote wrong can correct me in\na time of deceit acting in defense of the truth is a revolutionary\nact telling\nthe truth is a revolutionary act  that\nwas george orwell and i have to say that that in\nmy opinion what gary mckinnon has done and that if we go\nfast-forward to the future let us say the year 2050 when we\nall know the truth gary mckinnon will be in the forefront as one of\nthe people that we have to thank as a revolutionary\nfor being a hacker that is my opinion of it okay and i understand that steve you have a different view no no i am just saying i\ndo not want him to be harmed steve is saying that but what we are all about here\nis getting to the truth that is what this discussion has been\nabout we are claiming our right to know the secrets and there is a\nreason for that so with that is there anyone else\nthat wants to say a closing statement or a suggestion or i want brian to say the last\nword bo\u2019l well just a quick\nremark and that is that almost everything that applies to\net/ufo/disclosure also applies to free energy it is amazing how\nparallel and similar they are it is also amazing how many\nheroes in the free energy field \u2013 who have been\nassassinated who have been threatened now it is time for us all to\nstand and be counted and to create the revolution \u2013 peaceful\nrevolution it is a revolution in\nconsciousness bo\u2019l yes wonderful the truth what a concept bo\u2019l it will set us\nfree but first it will piss us off right okay thanks kerry i\nappreciate it very much okay thank you thank you\nvery very much thank you so much thank you alfred good job out in the world you guys\nare the hardest-working people in the field introduction kerry\ncassidy (kc the trail of the truth for over forty years if anything he is probably the\nexpert he has spawned most of the researchers you know such as\nzecharia sitchin and david icke and so on he brought them to the\npublic jordan\nhas not been credited in half the way that he should be \nand i want to do that right here he is\ngiven some of our lead researchers some information and they have\nnever credited him \u2013 okay so you may think it comes\nfrom them and that they are so smart and brilliant believe me they\nwould not be half the place they are today if it was not\nfor jordan maxwell and\nso we really want to honor him here today and we are very proud\nto have him speak at a project camelot conference presentation begins jordan\nmaxwell (jm thank you thank you very much i\nthink the one thing i had like for you to take away from anything\nthat i say today is this one point that nothing in this world works\nthe way you think it does nothing the\npolice are not who you think they are the sheriff is not who\nyou think he is banks do not do what you think they do governments\ndo not operate anywhere near the way you think they do and\nthat is why today when you look at what is going on in the\nworld today none of it makes any sense it is all crazy it\nmakes no sense at all it\nseems very destructive but actually in point of fact you do not\nknow how the system works it is working perfectly fine the\nrich get richer and the poor get poorer the people the masses are\nentertained with television and alcohol and drugs and the wealthy\ncontinue to get wealthy and so it is working perfectly fine\nonce you understand how the world really works and nothing works the\nway you think it does my\nwhole life i have been interested in theology and religion and\nthat is my real love i have spent all of my awakened hours\nof research throughout the country and throughout the world studying\ntheology and religion  but not to learn from\nit but to learn about\nit it is\na fascinating story once you see how our religions came into being you begin to see things that you have never seen before and begin\nto have questions that never occurred to you before so that is been my major love but i also in the early \u201980s very early \u201980s came into contact with some people who were\nexperts experts on government and banking and i was in their\ncompany for many years i learned how governments work and it was\nabsolutely astounding to me to see the real truth it is\ntaken me 48 years to get here tonight but i am going to give\nyou a secret that i have learned i am going to give this to\nyou for free this\nis a secret and it is a very powerful secret financially and in every other way people will always support what they want to\nhear they will not support what they do not want\nto hear if\nyou like country music you are not going to pay thirty bucks\nfor a rap concert if you like a particular movie star you are\nnot going to go see somebody else people will always i mean if\nyou like a particular kind of food you are not going to the\nopposite restaurant so\npeople will always support what they want to hear anyone who has\ntraveled and dealt with the public you will find that the one thing\nthat people generally speaking do not want to hear is the truth nobody is happy when they have to be faced with the truth there\nare some brave people like maybe you here today who are at least\nopen to hear something that may conflict with what you believe or\nwhat you know but at least you are truth-seekers that is\nwhat i have always been is a truth-seeker i\nalways say i am not the world\u2019s foremost authority on\nanything because i am at least smart enough to know how much i\ndo not know but when you begin to break down how government\nworks banks work you begin to see a whole world that you have\nnever known the\nword i use is occult occult\nsimply means hidden and this is exactly what is going on in the world today our\ngovernments banks institutions of education etcetera are\noperating on a totally occult or hidden basis and so what we are\ntold and given to understand is not the truth let\nme give you an example how many people have heard me lecture or talk\nabout the maritime system of commerce okay so most people at least\nhave heard about the subject for\nthose of you who have not i will just give you some\nexamples when\nyou go into court why do you have to go to court you play tennis on a court you play basketball on a court the whole idea in a court is to put the ball back in the other guy\u2019s\ncourt so you have a team of lawyers and they throw the ball back in\nanother guy\u2019s court and that team throws the ball back in the\nother guy\u2019s court and the judge is a referee and he does not\ncare who wins or loses he is going to get paid anyway so\nhe wears a black robe black robes most people never question why\ndo catholic priests wear black robes kids that graduate from high\nschool wear black robes judges wear black robes rabbis wear black\nrobes \u2013 because black robes represent the planet saturn they\nare a symbol for the planet saturn saturn\nwas called by the ancient people \u201clord of the rings and\nsaturn is lord of the rings this\nis why women were told in the ancient world to listen to their god\nand the concept was that they would wear an ear-ring men\nwere to get married before their god so they wear wedding rings because the old ancient god of the middle east one of the ancient\ngods of the middle east was the planet saturn saturn was directly\nconnected to yahweh the hebrew god so this is why even today the\njews celebrate the worship of saturn saturn\nin the old phoenician language was called shabath look up in the phoenician language you will find that the planet\nsaturn was called shabath\nand his worship to honor him once a week was called sabbath so when the jews are having sabbath they are actually paying homage to their god saturn lord of\nthe rings so\nwhen you start breaking down where religions have come from theologies have come from the\nsix-pointed star for instance is called the star of\ndavid actually it is\nnot the star of david all the encyclopedias and reference works will\ntell you that it is called the star of saturn it is a hexagram hexagrams represented the planet saturn then\nwhen you look at the christian system of things the church is a\ndisgrace in my opinion period the christian church is a disgrace everything that comes out of the christian church in america is a\ndisgrace it is filled with lies deception innuendos it is a\nmoney-making corporation that operates under maritime admiralty law and there is a whole world of knowledge that christians have not been\ngiven about the scriptures about who wrote the bible where it came\nfrom i\nhave found that even judaism is not a b.c ed\nnote before christ now designated as b.c.e or\n\u201cbefore common era religion it did not exist in the b.c you know so when we talk\nabout ancient jerusalem there was no ancient israel \u2013 jerusalem yes \u2013 but no\nancient israel so when you think about how preachers and religious\nleaders talk about ancient\nisrael this and ancient\nisrael that in point of\nfact israel is not a b.c religion the\nwhole concept of the old testament was developed right around the\n9th 10th 11th and 12th century a.d ed\nnote anno\ndomini or \u201cyear of our lord now called \u201cthe\ncommon era and designated c.e but begins dating from birth\nof christ] so that the\nold testament is not an ancient\nrecord of an ancient\npeople there was\nno ancient israel two\nof the greatest scholars \u2013 archaeologists \u2013 in israel\nhave written a book called unearthing\nthe bible these two men these two archaeologists are the best and the brightest of the\narchaeologists in israel in\ntheir book basically that is what they have said there was\nno moses there was no king solomon there was no king david the\nentire thing was written probably in the 8th 9th and 10th\ncentury\na.d in europe developed and ultimately all of that was taken by\nthe jesuits and the catholic church and rewoven into a story and\ngiven to us today as an ancient\nisrael there was no\nancient israel it never existed there\nwas no moses there was no king solomon solomon\nwas sol-om-on sol\nis latin for the sun om\nis the hindu word for the creative force and on\nis the name of the sun in egypt the greeks call it heliopolis but the egyptians called the city of the sun on go look in the dictionary look up the word on it will tell you it is the city of the sun in egypt this is why\nyou flip a light-switch on because it was a city of light so you take sol-om-on the three names of the sun in the ancient\nesoteric languages it becomes solomon even\nin the ancient bibles the old bibles from the 12th 13th and 14th\ncentury it did not say king\ndavid \u2013 it kept\ntalking about king druid and\nincidentally the system of government and laws that we live under\ntoday in america and in the western world is a druidic\nsystem america is a druidic country canada is druidic like i said western civilization is a druidic establishment the\ndruids were a very powerful priesthood in europe even before the\nroman empire existed they were the attorneys the lawyers the\nreligious leaders the politicians it was called the druidic\nsystem one\nof the most important symbols in the druidic system was a magic wand like merlin the magician with his magic wand orchestra leaders and\nconductors use a magic wand that is a druid symbol the\ndruid symbol of the magic wand was made out of the wood of a holly\ntree it is made out of holly\nwood and the entire\nestablishment \u2013 hollywood \u2013 is a druidic system so if\nyou do not understand druidic symbols you will never know\nwhat is going on in hollywood and where they are being\nfinanced who is financing them and how this stuff really works\nin relation to government there is\nan enormous amount of material out on the web showing pictures \u2013\nfrom motion pictures \u2013 from five six seven years before 2001 before 9/11 in which 9/11 is in motion pictures and the original\nfilm of matrix in\nthe original matrix\nmovie the star is given some kind of an affidavit to sign which is\nhis identification or something and the camera zooms in on it for\njust a moment when he is signing it but if you stop the film stop it and back it up and zoom in you will see the document is\nabout something that is going to happen it says september 11 2001 and this was way before september 11th before 9/11 chris\ncarter classic example of what i am talking about hollywood chris carter the creator of x-files when x-files\nended chris carter the producer started a whole new television\nseries called the lone\ngunmen the very first\nmovie was a lead-off movie for the new television series and in that\nmovie that came out right around february or march of 2001 february\nor march of 2001 chris carter\u2019s new television show called\nthe lone gunmen was started on fox television in the very first episode it is\ntalking about how factions within the us government were going to fly\n757s into the world trade center and knock them down purposely and\nin the movie you are seeing the planes going into the world\ntrade center that\nwas back you know eight months before it even happened chris\ncarter is telling you something in the movie and in the movie they\nask well why are these\npeople in the government doing it and\none of the guys in government said because\nwe need to control the middle east we need to control the oil flow we need to have a dominant place in the middle east so that we can\npromote wars which is good for business\nand but that is in the movie and it shows the planes going into the\nworld trade center general\nelectric about three or four years before 9/11 general electric\ncame out with a refrigerator in italy and on the face of the\nrefrigerator painted were two jets flying into the world trade\ncenter it shows the world trade center and two big planes flying\ninto them and i have many many pictures from hollywood showing 9/11\njets flying into the world trade center so all i am saying is that hollywood knows what is going on and this whole thing is being orchestrated from behind the scenes to\nknock down the world trade center the\nday it happened i became so depressed i just dropped out of\nspeaking i no longer toured i no longer did radio i no longer\ntalked to anyone and i have been out of commission for many\nyears because 9/11 just shut me down as\nfar as i was concerned i was through with america i was through\nwith all of it because any country that can buy three high-rises\nfalling down into dust and not ask any questions about that i just\ngave up responding\nto audience yeah because i am well aware of how governments\nwork religions work and banks well let me give you an example there are only two things on the earth land and water people\nlive on land so the law of\nthe land is the law of\npeople who live on land that is why it is called the law\nof the land but the law of the land is different in every country\nbecause it is the law of the people who live on the land you\ncan do things in russia  you cannot do in america you can\ndo things in south africa that you cannot do in china so the\nlaw of the land is different in every country but\nthe law of water is the law of money \u2013 the cash flow the\nliquid assets i will give you an example of how this works\nbecause when a ship pulls into harbor it is coming in on water\nand it is going to bring products so all ships by law must be\nfemale this is why you will always hear a captain saying that she\nis a good ship she is seaworthy she because all ships are female and the reason why is because she\nproduces the product when\na ship pulls into harbor it parks at the dock each piece coming off the ship has to have a certificate\nof manifest and the ship\n\u2013 where it sits \u2013 is in its berth so when you were born you came out of your mother\u2019s water so you have to have a birth\ncertificate and it is\nsigned by the doc\nand if you drop the car or the television it is a stillborn\nso you have to have a death\ncertificate so\nyour body as a matter of fact your body is a security on the new\nyork stock exchange if\nyou take your social security card \u2013 and i am not going to\ntalk much more about this because there are other things i want to\ntalk about  but this i think is interesting if you take your\nsocial security card on the back of a social security card you will\nsee a series of numbers those numbers on mine are in red and those\nnumbers on the back of the social security card represent your\nphysical body on the stock exchange in new york and\nif you take a bill any kind of american bill \u2013 whatever it is 10 20 100 1 whatever it is \u2013 you will see a series of\nnumbers here code numbers on the bill you match the numbers on the\nbill with the back of the social security card it is\nbecause there is about six-and-a-half-million dollars or more\ncirculating around the world with your social security number on the\nbill because your body has a security on the new york stock exchange they\nare buying and selling your personal body on the stock exchange in\nnew york most people do not understand any of this and have no\nidea what i am talking about but it is the way banks work and\nso i have discovered also that banks and government are basically\nbased on religion religion is at the bottom of all of this this\nis why i have no respect i have a respect a reasonable respect for\nlaw and order i am not so stupid as not to understand the need\nfor red lights and the things which are required in law for people to\nlive together but i have no respect for religion government banking and especially educational institutions because i know who\nfinances these organizations i know where the money comes from our\nbanks were given to us by the knights templars the masonic lodge of\nknights templars in europe our educational institutions universities and colleges were given to us by the masonic order\ncoming out of rome this\nis why the square mortar-board is a catholic symbol and jews how\nmany jews know that when you wear a yarmulke that is not\njewish that is roman that is why the pope wears the\nyarmulke that is why the cardinals wear the yarmulke it is\na roman symbol it is not jewish the\njews were told to wear the yarmulke to show subjection to rome and\nthey got so used to using it they think it is a jewish symbol it is not jewish it is roman another\nthing that bothers me too when it comes to religion \u2013 there\nis a world of difference between being anti-semitic\nand anti-jewish it does not mean the same thing at all so\nwhen you hear someone use the term anti-semitic\njust remember that there is four kinds of semitic north east south and west semitic and there are 13 different races of people in\nthe world that are semitic the arabs are semitic so\nwhen you say someone\u2019s anti-semitic it means that they are against 13 races of people in the world 13\nnations when somebody says something about jewish it is anti-jewish not anti-semitic so\nit is just a small point but it is big with me because\npeople use terms and they use the wrong terms and do not\nunderstand what they are saying religion government educational institutions i have found that so many\npeople willingly and as i said last night on this forum so many\npeople willingly bend themselves to what their masters want from\nthem what your masters want is for you to be in compliance for you\nto think what they have told you to think i have\nbeen behind the cameras in national television studios and watched\nnetwork news people doing their job what most people do not realize\nis on the nightly news from the networks when you see the newsman\ntalking directly to you he is talking right into the camera\ngiving you the news in point of fact that is not what is\nhappening there\nis a big box a large box with a television screen on the bottom and\nthere is a glass a clear glass on an angle and there is a\nguy sitting off to the side typing or it is already typed they are telling the newsman what to say word for word and so\nthe television screen is hitting this glass and it is reflecting\nstraight out so that the newsman can sit right there and look\ndirectly into the camera and read the news so\nhe is just reading what somebody else wrote and that guy wrote\nit because the boss told him what to write the news is nothing more\nthan what somebody higher up wants you to believe so\nthat is why i have no respect for the news i do not watch\ntelevision i am not interested in hollywood or movies as such but there is a lot of interesting stuff in movies government again i say and it is just my belief i believe government\nboils down to the war between the crips\nand the bloods that is all it is it is just one gang is\nsuperior to another gang unless of course that other gang gets a\nlittle more money and gets a little bit more vicious now they take\nover town so it is a war between gangs because\nafter all when it is all boiled down it boils down to one\nthing we are all human and humans like martin luther king\nsaid people are\norganizations martin\nluther king said organizations are a lot more naughtier than\nindividuals individuals can be bad and corrupt but when you get a\nwhole bunch of individuals bad and corrupt and they are wearing\nuniforms and wearing badges now you have got a gang and\nthe police department even have said that they tell me things like\nthat you know we are\nthe biggest gang in town we are legal we can do whatever we\nwant so\ni understood a long time ago that government is simply gang warfare who is going to run this town what family in the mob is going\nto run this area of the town so that is why i have no respect for\ngovernment banking or any of the rest of it i\ncould go on about so many different things that i am interested\nin again like i said religion is a big thing with me i\nbelieve that the story about jesus in the new testament it is\njust my opinion but i believe that that story is an encoded message it is a metaphor it does not represent history as such but it\nis a very powerful encoded story if\nyou understand the symbols and the words that are used in the new\ntestament in the story of jesus and understand that the entire story\nis a metaphor you read between the lines and begin to see that\nthere is symbols and ideas are being expressed and you did not\neven see it a\nclassic example is why did judas go out and kiss jesus just\nan example in the bible we are told that judas went out and\nkissed jesus christians will tell you well the reason why he did that was to identify him so that he could be\narrested no logic alone would tell you that is incorrect because jesus\nwould not have been living in the south side of chicago or the north\nend of new york he would have been living in a little mickey mouse\nlittle village probably 300 people there at the most 15 to 20\nminutes to walk across the whole town and\nso how could he be hiding who would be so stupid as to not know who\nhe is he is sitting out there in the garden with his followers so what do you need to go out and kiss him for to identify well that is not what the bible says it does not say he went\nout to identify it says judas went out and kissed jesus to\nbetray him not identify this\nis why the mafia when you are going to be killed they give you\nthe kiss of death in the ancient world in the middle east when a scorpion bites you it\nleaves two cuts on your skin and those two cuts look just like human\nlips so the ancient people said you have been given the\nkiss of death this\nis why when the mob\u2019s going to whack you they give you the\nkiss of death right it is because the scorpion is a\nback-biter jesus\nrepresents in the story a symbol it is a metaphor and jesus is\na metaphor for the sun and so boiling it down christianity is sun\nworship based on astrology because nobody owns the sun africans\ndo not own it and we do not own the sun so obviously the\nsun belongs to god \u2013 so it is god\u2019s sun\n and he is\nthe light of the world of\ncourse the sun\u2019s the light of the world what else lights the\nworld if it is not the sun and\nhe has twelve helpers yeah of course the twelve signs of the\nzodiac the twelve months of the year he\nis our risen savior of course it rises every morning about 5:30 and the sun is\nyour savior if it do not come up we are dead so\nonce you start breaking down the symbols in the new testament you\nbegin to see that christianity is basically astrology and sun\nworship but it has been so well hidden and so cleverly disguised once you start breaking it down and reading the whole story it\nbecomes overwhelmingly obvious that this is what we are talking\nabout he\nhas a virgin birth he is born of a virgin  of course virgin\nbirth because one of the constellations of the zodiac is virgo virgo the virgin let\nme give you an example of how this works on the first day of summer the very first day of summer the sun is as high in the northern\nhemisphere as it is going to go it does not go any further\nnorth the\nfirst day of summer the sun is high in the northern hemisphere and\nit begins to work its way south each day it moves one degree and as\nit moves one degree each day 90 days later or 90 degrees later it is\nhalf-way down so now we say that the sun was the lion\nking in summer the lion\nking because the sun was in the constellation of leo the lion king\nfrom disney but\nthen as the sun moves southward it finally hits scorpio so god\u2019s\nsun\n was\nreally hot he was the lion king but now he is falling so now we call that fall\nbecause he is fallen and he is falling\nsouth so it moves into fall\nin scorpio this\nis why judas gives jesus the kiss\nof death because judas\nrepresents scorpio and scorpio gives god\u2019s sun the\nlight of the world the kiss of death and now he is going to die\nin capricorn he is going to die and go all the way down but\nwhat is interesting about this is that the sun goes all the way\ndown south until it hits what is called the winter solstice and\nthat is on december 22nd the\nsun hits the lowest point on the sky in the south on december 22nd it is called the winter solstice the beginning of winter and\nfor three days the united states navy will show and explain it to\nyou that the sun comes up for three days the 22nd 23rd and 24th\non the same degree it does not go any further south and it\ndoes not come back north on\nthe same degree that it was on on december 22nd the sun rises the\nnext two days 23rd and 24th on the same degree so the ancient\npeople said that the sun\n was\nalive it was the lion of the tribe of judah leo who got the kiss\nof death from scorpio and now for three days he is not moving\nat all so therefore he is in his tomb for three days then\non the 25th of december the sun moves one degree northward and you\ncan calculate that as the navy does you can calculate it it is\nvery slight but if you have got the right instruments you can\nsee the sun move one degree northward therefore it came\nback to life so\nnow we celebrate god\u2019s sun[and/or\nson] being born again he is born again when on december 25th so we celebrate\nchristmas or christ mass as\nthe sun moves back towards the northern hemisphere it crosses over\nthe equator at spring\nbecause he was dead in winter now he is springing\nback to life so\nas he comes back to life and crosses over the equator there was a\ncelebration called the passover\nbecause the sun has passed\nover the\nequator coming back to the northern hemisphere so\ntoday when someone dies we say grandmother\npassed last night grandfather passed away or they\npassed on but always\npassed\nwas associated with death so god\u2019s sun\n has\npassed over\nthe equator so\nonce a year around the world the jews celebrate the passover which\nis nothing more than the sun passing over the equator christians of course cannot do that because that is jewish and they\nwould not want to have anything to do with the jewish\ncelebration so christians have a totally different celebration they\ncall it the resurrection\nof god\u2019s son and\nso they go out on the passover and go out and have something called\nthe easter sunrise\nservice so you actually\nhave christians going out and waiting for the sun\nto come up for something called a sunrise\nservice i mean what is that all about christians are worshipping\nthe sun and\nthen when you start looking at how the word s-o-n\nand s-u-n\nare interchangeable in christianity and god knows there is a\nlot of information on that so basically you boil down christianity\nas sun worship astrology the\nold testament is astrology sun worship yahweh as i said was\nassociated with the sun and the planet saturn let\nme give you another example about the ancient religions of the world moses\nwas a lunar deity moses was the leader of the moon cult this is why\nin all the paintings and sculpturing in europe you always see moses\nwearing horns have you ever seen that moses wearing horns it is\nin the vatican it is in all the museums of the world why\nis moses always pictured with horns because moses was the leader of\na lunar cult the moon worshippers so at one time the jews were\nworshippers of the moon and that period of time we call the period of\nmoses this\nis why the native americans their chiefs wore horns the vikings\nwore horns because all of these cults cultures \u2013 native\namericans vikings and the ancient people of the middle east \u2013\nworshipped the moon the\nmoon of course in the lower quarter was the horns and this is why\nthey wore horns in\narabia there is a high mountain range and at night from the\negyptian side the moon comes up in the east it comes up from a\nmountain range and so the ancient peoples believed that the moon was\na god and that it lived in the mountain and so their religious\ncelebrations of the old\nman of the mountain the\nmoon god in\nthe ancient arabic system the moon god was called sin s-i-n that was his name the moon god of arabia was sin and a mountain in the ancient language a mountain was spelt a-i so you take a mountain \u2013 ai\n\u2013 with the god who\nlived in the mountain the moon god \u2013 sin\n\u2013 and put it together and it becomes sin-ai so\nyou get all the moses goes up into sinai no it is sin-ai the mountain of the moon god this is why jews have their celebration\nafter sundown because that is when the moon comes out they\ndo not have their celebration during the day because that is\nwhen the sun\u2019s out so that is the time for christians to\ncelebrate god\u2019s sun the jews\nare worshipping the moon god sin so\ni do not intend to i am not trying to offend anyone but\ni am just trying to tell you where religions come from religions have been given to us by the same people who gave us our\ngovernment our banks our educational institutions our whole entire\nruddy system in western civilization is based on religion politics sex drugs and rock \u2018n roll it is\njust business it is just money it is just the control of people and\nif you think it is crazy when i say sex you have no idea in the world how sex plays a part in everything the\nvery fact that a man wears a black robe that is a feminine\ndress and god there is so much you could talk about with\nthis subject of sex in religion i mean the whole thing is based on\nsex the\ncross is a sexual symbol even in egypt the egyptian obelisk the\negyptian obelisk is like the washington monument for instance the washington monument has an egyptian obelisk an obelisk\nrepresented a male phallic in the erection and the male phallic is\nconnected to the female ovaries it is called the oval\noffice right and\nthe water down the water strip is her water and so when her\nwater breaks the male phallic connects to the female ovaries the\noval office sexual symbols everywhere a\nsix-pointed star a star of saturn so\nthe point i am making is that our institutions around the world especially in western civilization are based on symbolism lies deception manipulation of our thinking and\nsomewhere along the line if you are really looking for truth \u2013\nand most people are not like that movie when the who was\nit tom yeah in the movie anyway the kid says he wants the truth and the other guy said you\ncannot handle the truth the\nmove is \u201ca few good men with tom cruise and jack\nnicolson locked in a classic court battle over the truth i believe\nthat is exactly right i do not think that the world of\nmankind can handle the real truth about how the world really works you\nknow i said last night that i believe that democracy is the very\nworst possible form of government on the earth i do not think\nyou can get a worse government than democracy and\nthe reason i am saying that i can clarify it now first of all\ndemos\nin greek is a mob that is why when a mob is out in the street with plaques ranting and raving we call it a demo-stration a demo-stration\nis demo\nis a mob of people and\nso demo-ocracy\n\u2013 ocracy\nis the rule so the rule of the mob is democracy true democracy is 45 whites\nhanging one black that is democracy we\nall voted and one guy\u2019s got to die we all voted it is\ndemocracy no america was founded as a constitutional republic a constitutional\nrepublic means there is a set rule of laws that everyone abides by and it was set up in such a way as to protect the person the\nindividual from the mob you\nknow down south where i come from the ku klux klan they could pick\nout anybody they want and there is 45 of them and they take you\nout and hang you and who is going to say anything it is\nwas a democracy we all voted and therefore it must be legal no america was set up as a constitutional republic which means the\nconstitution was a law and everyone no matter who it is in the\ncountry had to abide by the law and it protected you as an\nindividual the\nbiggest problem with a democracy is very simple if you just think\nabout it democracy means mob\nrule it does not\nmatter what the law says and\nincidentally i want to throw this out to you we hear all the time\nthat america is the land\nof laws we are a country\nbased on law in point of fact that is not true in point of fact it is just the\nopposite america is the most lawless country on the earth period there is no law in\namerica think\nabout that what i just told you there\nis no law in america what we have here is whatever the judge says it is and whatever the\njudge says it is that is what the law is if\nyou go to a different court and a different judge but the same\nidentical information facts and figures he will maybe give a\ndifferent verdict well that is what the law says that is the law no that is not the law it is what that guy said i\nlearned all of this when i was traveling around going to the\ndifferent churches and different cults jehovah\u2019s witnesses are\na classic example i could use the mormons as a classic example i\ncould use any of these churches as classic examples of what i am\ntalking about there\nis no set law in any religious organization in the church or any\ncult or any group or any political group it is whatever the\nboss in that particular group says it is \u2013 that is what\nthe law is and\nso even in jehovah\u2019s witnesses they will have the elder in\nthat church will tell you well here\u2019s what the bible says and here\u2019s what the law is now if you go to a different one he is was like oh\nthat guy\u2019s full of bull here\u2019s what the real thing here\u2019s the real and\nthen you understand it does not matter where you go in any\nmormon church in any seventh day adventist church any\nchristadelphian any world wide church of god any cult any rabbi any synagogue it does not matter whoever is in charge of\nthat one particular church where you are that is the law and\nthat is exactly what is going on in america it does not\nmatter what the actual law books say you cannot go into a court in\nthis country and win on the basis of facts that is the facts of\nlife you cannot win in a court in america on the basis of facts period the\njudge do not give a damn about the facts he is the boss\nand in this court he calls the shots well\nyeah but the other judge said i\ndo not care what the other judge said this is my court and i\ncall the shots so i will decide if i kind of like you maybe i will\ngive you a break if i do not like you maybe i will add ten\nyears now what are you going to do about it you\nsay yeah well but the\nlaw says no no do not bring that up this is my court i call the shots therefore\nthere is no law america is a land of lawlessness in\nthe bible in the book of revelations it talks about the\nrise of the man of lawlessness and i have often wondered about that it is very interesting a\nlot of interesting important stuff written in the bible if you know\nwhat you are looking at but\nit talks about in the book of revelation the rise of something called\nthe man of lawlessness\nand i used to wonder what in the world was that all about because\namerica\u2019s got so many laws we have got thousands of law\nbooks that is all we are we have got law books so how can\nthere be a man of\nlawlessness that would\nrise in the world well now i understand america is the home of the man of lawlessness george\nbush could not care less what the constitution says the bill of\nrights it just do not matter he is the boss and\nwhatever he says do that is what you are doing you say but the law says they do not care and if you bring that up again you are\ngoing to jail why because he represents the vatican the\nbush regime was front for the vatican \u2013 the most important\nenemy this country has today people will never understand it but\nthe biggest enemy that this nation today has is the vatican the\nvatican is behind the crap that is going on all over what\ndo you think the founding fathers whatever we call them the\nfounding fathers where did they come from the people who founded\nthis country they came from europe well for 2,500 years rome under the caesars of rome and then after the fall of the caesars in\nthe 4th century and with the coming of the vatican in the 5th\ncentury all of europe has been dominated for over 2,500 years by\nrome and europe has dominated the world for 2,500 years so\ni am saying that if you want to find out who the real enemy of\nthis country is you had better start looking at the holy father\nand you had better start finding out the connection between the\nvatican and the nazi party of adolf hitler thank you thank you jordan i am sorry we have very\nlimited time so we have to let david wilcock come on stage now and i am just getting warmed up i know you are and god bless\nyou that is right stand up for\nthis man thank you thank you jordan we had love to do a camelot interview with\nyou jordan i am saying that here in public on stage anytime i want to add one more comment quickly when you hear people talk\nabout jewish conspiracy jewish this and jewish that it is\nvatican not jewish thank you very much thank you so much thank you thank you brian o\u2019leary (bo\u2019l it is funny about\n                  technical stuff is not it i think definitely the mechanistic\n                  age is still around and some day we will have holographic\n                  videoing from another dimension and then we will not have\n                  all these wires and stuff some of you that are younger remember these times remember\n                  all of the preparation all the video cameras and stuff like\n                  that and then just imagine what it might be like in a better\n                  world a world of free energy a world with holograms and\n                  world of consciousness a world of combined positive intention a world of things working actually working.what i had like to do now during the segue into project\n                    camelot and i had not heard much about project\n                    camelot i have known steve greer for a long long long time i was one of the people that got steve greer into\n                    his area of inquiry in the first place and then along come these people that call themselves project\n                    camelot and i said hmm i wonder what that is\n                    all about little by little i would start to cruise\n                    through their website and find out that what they are\n                    doing needs to be done there is a very strong need for this which is to interview\n                  in a very friendly way going way beyond what let us\n                  say george noory does or art bell on coast to coast because these folks really go into depth they do their homework that is very important they actually read the books of\n                  the people that they are interviewing so there is this stable of visionaries mostly elders people that could die any time voice interrupting background\n                  noise] was there some yeah kerry cassidy (kc it is gone now.bo\u2019l it is gone now great so what these\n                  people are doing i am beginning to appreciate slowly\n                  more and more i had a really nice talk with bill this morning\n                   bill ryan from england who has a very eclectic background and so does kerry so they are doing this project and they threw themselves\n                  into it as volunteers at first that is always a sign\n                  that these people are really dedicated because people that\n                  seek funding right away before they actually do it sometimes\n                  they have a silver spoon in their mouth and they do not\n                  really get a whole lot done but these guys have really really\n                  gotten a lot done.and so when bill and i were talking this morning it suddenly\n                  occurred to me that not only have they been gathering information and doing it using video equipment and so forth but they have\n                  been able to respect the wishes of those whom they have interviewed\n                  regarding what is on the record and what is off the\n                  record and that it does not necessarily have to fit within\n                  a sound byte and so we have now for the next three hours three and half\n                  hours during this conference you are going to hear from\n                  them and you are going to hear some of their sharings\n                  and stories i am just so glad that you decided to come kerry and\n                  bill and kay you are on bill ryan kerry cassidy project\n                  camelot bill ryan (br just a moment here we are going\n                  to get ourselves wired up for sound yeah you have to grab the live lead thank you very much ok ok so we are both on short leashes here which is not our accustomed style especially not me i am a little too wild to\n                  leash but at any rate you are gonna start because you are always very good\n                  at the overview type of thing so i am going to start ok we have a lot of\n                  stories to tell by the way some of which we have not\n                  really told before either because they are very funny\n                  or they are against us and we have actually got to\n                  the point here where we are very happy to tell a lot of\n                  stories against ourselves one of the ones that i really like  i really love it \n                  is we had an email from somebody a few months ago who said you\n                  know what i  was sure that you guys must\n                  have been a cia operation and must have been sponsored by those\n                  guys but then i realized that you were so amateurish that\n                  you could not possibly be cia ok and i take offense at that that is his\n                  story my first encounter with kerry cassidy was when i\n                  was speaking from my own particular sins at the laughlin\n                  ufo conference in the end of february in 2006 because i had\n                  got tangled up in a really weird story that i am happy\n                  to say a few words about but not more than a few when i was\n                  basically talking about a disclosure program that i had got\n                  myself inadvertently wrapped up with i was being interviewed by several people and it was the\n                  first time i had ever been interviewed by anybody it is\n                  like at 5 of the clock in the afternoon i was being interviewed by some guy who had poured his life\n                  savings in his cameras there is a camera here and a big\n                  tripod and a camera there and he had all these microphones\n                  and he spent about 15 minutes setting it all up this was for\n                  some kind of tv deal and i never even made a note of what it\n                  was or who it was or something.that was at 5 of the clock and then at 6 of the clock i\n                  was with kerry kerry came in with this tiny little camera put it on this tiny little tripod and i thought where is\n                  the rest of the stuff and then kerry started\n                  talking to me and that was it and what i want to say about that is that this is the spirit\n                  in which camelot started it started in the way that\n                  we would both encourage anybody else to start anything which\n                  is that you pick up whatever it is you happen to have even\n                  if it is just your own courage and your hands and nothing\n                  else and start and what is really important is the vision\n                  that you hold.and i want to acknowledge kerry here because really inasmuch\n                  as anything has a bit of a lineage - and we can go back and\n                  back and back to where we really started - but kerry started\n                  the vision that was camelot because of her own history\n                  with hollywood way back prior to october 2005 when she got\n                  frustrated with the whole business and said you know what i am just gonna do my own thing thank you well actually let us\n                  back up because as much as i had like to take credit for\n                  things i have to say that camelot started with camelot the real camelot in the early days we were both very inspired\n                  by that.and as it happened i did interview him at laughlin actually initially i thought he represented the serpo project you know how interesting can that be he is not actually\n                  the whistleblower he is not actually the one telling\n                  the story so i was not really excited to interview him when i first went up to interview him he kind of hemmed and\n                  hawed and said well maybe i will have time later\n                  tonight then he said he would not then he said\n                  he would but initially he had on e-mail agreed to be interviewed so the interview did happen and i was very impressed because\n                  he was very balanced although he was the spokesperson for\n                  the serpo project in a sense because he built the\n                  website not because he had anything to do with it in particular it was an alien exchange program that our government was involved\n                  in back in the early \u201960s supposedly by the way it is\n                  online in case you want to investigate further but basically he was very balanced in the way he handled the\n                  questions and i threw some left jabs whatever you want to\n                  call it right hooks actually to kind of to see how riled he would get and\n                  to get to the root of the story which is kind of my way in\n                  case you have watched the videos and he handled it very\n                  well he actually had a calm sense of humor about it he did not\n                  get defensive and this counted for a lot with me eventually we went to dinner we started talking comparing\n                  notes we both had been researching incredible amounts of material\n                   conspiracies you name it ufos metaphysics spiritual\n                  disciplines  all our lives up until that point so we both\n                  had quite a backlog and it ended up that we had quite a bit\n                  in common.then i went on a trip to egypt my mother had passed away\n                  and left me a small inheritance which eventually financed camelot for\n                  almost two years and i went to egypt with actually jordan\n                  maxwell and william henry.voice wow that is where i interviewed jordan very briefly that was still camelot had not begun and\n                  on the way back from egypt i was in touch with bill we kept\n                  in touch over the e-mails and we arranged that i would come\n                  to england to visit him.and so i did we ended up going to stonehenge to a lot of\n                  power places in england and we went to tintegal one of the\n                  supposed homes of king arthur when we went to tintegal \n                  i do not know if you have ever been there  it is\n                  a really stunning absolutely stunning place on the coast and has a lot of mystical and interesting power around it we were really struck by it.and we started talking about what could we do here we both\n                  had these incredible backgrounds bill as a webmaster myself\n                  as a film maker we were both writers we both had spiritual\n                  backgrounds and we said what can we do to absolutely\n                  change the paradigm that was going on and actually maybe force disclosure so right then and there we created camelot both\n                  of us were very inspired by the king arthur roundtable concept where there were no leaders and followers per se but that in the spirit of arthur you know everyone came to\n                  the table it was all balanced there were no hierarchies and worked together for what could be a better vision of the\n                  future.i believe that was the initial king arthur vision and i do\n                  believe that both of us lived back in those times and both\n                  of us were tapping into that when we connected and that has not\n                  changed so it is very remarkable that mere [ed note brian o\u2019leary\u2019s artist wife meredith] has these\n                  lovely arthur-like visions and the sword and all of that going\n                  on and it was also a synchronicity you know that john f kennedy\n                  had sort of a vision of a better future that was at least implied if not carried out when he was president it was also sort\n                  of an echo if you will out there we decided to call it project camelot because project being\n                  sort of the forerunning name that most deep black projects\n                  contained i worked for a short time at jpl for nasa helping in media and i was writing a screenplay called project moondust i worked in hollywood for like 20 years and i was trying\n                  to pitch projects sci-fi projects to open minds and change\n                  the paradigm and getting absolutely nowhere that is why i picked up a home you know non-professional\n                  camcorder and just said screw it i am gonna make\n                  a documentary i am gonna go interview these people at\n                  ufo conferences because they have got something to say and i want the world to hear it so that whole thing just took off and then also by synchronicity bill was in touch with mr x yes just to say a little bit about that envisioning\n                  and sort of initial actualization - the prompting to see it\n                  as camelot when we were at tintegal in cornwall some\n                  of you may have had the same experience it was one of those things - it did not take hours and\n                  hours of agonizing strategic planning the whole thing was\n                  completely visualized visualized and agreed with a spontaneous obvious synergy between us in probably about two minutes flat we just spelled out between us the vision in the very broadest\n                  general terms and literally i think within one or two or three\n                  minutes we had agreed that this is what we are going\n                  to do and there was not the slightest bit of doubt if we had stopped to think about it then we would have thought all about the \u201cyes buts and \u201chang\n                  on a minute and how are we going\n                  to finance it and all this kind of stuff and\n                  this never even crossed our minds it just sounded like fun and actually that spirit of fun\n                  and what the heck let us do it has actually\n                  been what is behind this whole thing in the last two and\n                  a half years i mean at that time we did not envisage anything that\n                  was this large we could not possibly have imagined that\n                  here we were in vilcabamba just a few feet away from somebody\n                  who is widely respected throughout the world as a visionary\n                  and a physicist and an astronaut and in a different timeline\n                  might have ended up as being the first person officially to\n                  have set foot on mars and so on and so forth i mean it is become so big the whole thing has just\n                  evolved in front of us like we are on oiled wheels with\n                  someone else doing the steering and someone else doing the\n                  powering and we will talk about this a little bit more\n                  as we have the opportunity during the day we take very little\n                  credit for anything that is happened here.in retrospect we can look back and we can see that we make\n                  a great show you know i mean it is like we have\n                  got the mulder and scully we have got the two\n                  different personality types we have got a man a woman the american and the brit you have got the skeptic well the slightly more skeptic and the slightly more esoteric and we make quite a good standup team you know i do not think you should be complimenting\n                  us that is really embarrassing ok so i have to say that also i know people are gonna ask\n                  this people have been asking us this for ages why do\n                  you have a cheetah the reason is because what happened was we ended up going\n                  to africa because bill was born in africa and he was able to\n                  take me on safari one of the reasons i even came to visit\n                  bill in england initially was because i knew that he knew about\n                  africa and i am avid fan of africa i guess you might say and of egypt and so we set out on a safari very early on in our travels\n                  as a kind of a break that we would take so one of the times\n                  we were out there i was able to shoot a cheetah a real live\n                  cheetah that was you know a young cheetah a beautiful beautiful\n                  animal we spent hours videotaping him then when we were creating a logo for camelot i\n                  was actually because i came from hollywood it was my kind\n                  of smartass nod if you will to mgm and the mgm\n                  lion which is very very famous i think as a symbol of hollywood and you know the beginning of motion pictures and of course\n                  i always wanted to make movies so i thought putting that as\n                  our logo at the beginning of our videos was kind of a statement also the concentration on the eye if you have seen our\n                  logo i do not have my t-shirt on with our logo and\n                  the eye being that we are watching you just as you are\n                  watching us \u2013 a nod to the government in that respect.so that is why we have the cheetah logo and cheetahs\n                  are faster and the internet was our medium and therefore\n                  we are lighter faster than the mgm logo lion.voice yes you are all right so when we actually started camelot we actually had something to do it was not just a blank\n                  sheet of paper brian just now has mentioned the disclosure project and we do not know steven greer we have never met him we have never corresponded with him we have never\n                  run across him in any of the conferences or on any of our travels we would love to do that we do not know how he regards\n                  us we do not even know if he knows about us but like many of you probably i personally was inspired\n                  by the 2001 washington press conference i think it was in\n                  may 2001 when steven greer did a very impressive presentation\n                  in front of a lot of invited mainstream media and presenting\n                  over a period of several hours quite a number of people some\n                  of whom have later become our own camelot witnesses i remember this vividly because i was driving in scotland\n                  at the time very late at night it was about 2 of the clock\n                  in the morning and this thing was being reported live on the\n                  radio i was so fascinated by what was happening i could barely\n                  believe it i stopped the car and listened to it at that time sorry but actually this is so\n                  typical we are having some anomalous sound effects in\n                  the background they have cut out now so maybe you need\n                  to hold the mic a certain way maybe hold it up there ok thanks as many of you probably have done i\n                  found myself asking well what happened to the disclosure\n                  project what happened to the videos they promised to release what happened as an outcome of what seemed to be such a huge\n                  promise that was made publicly back in 2001 now i do not intend to even try and answer that question\n                  and there is absolutely no implied criticism but to\n                  use the jargon of one of my careers prior to camelot which is actually working in business and consultancy there\n                  seemed to be a gap in the market now my reaction would say using the jargon from another one\n                  of my careers as a team-building specialist and a team-building\n                  consultant there is actually room for more people in\n                  this team we need as many people as possible putting their\n                  shoulders to the wheel to get this information out so i thought well you know we are not trying to\n                    supplant the guy we are not trying to interfere with\n                    his intentions but actually there are people out there waiting\n                    for information so kerry has a little camera which i could\n                    probably fit in my trouser pocket here so let us go you\n                    know?and in my experience with the serpo project  and\n                  let me give a nod to that because some of you may not know\n                  about it some of you may have read about it some of you may\n                  have read criticism about it it is all very weird it involves a purported claimed\n                  us alien exchange program that happened back in the \u201960s\n                  and \u201970s i became tangled up in this because just like\n                  you guys here i was in the metaphorical audience attached\n                  to an e-mail user group where this material about this us alien exchange program was being released from an anonymous\n                  source somebody in that news group said you know what this\n                    is interesting information here we need to archive this\n                    on a website and i was dumb enough to say hey i can do that i have got time on my hands so i became the webmaster for this release of information\n                  that was coming from sources within the dia - the defense intelligence\n                  agency this is a very very long story which we do not\n                  involve but there was something behind that i got tangled up with a whole lot of people from the intelligence\n                  community there was interference from behind the black curtain we ended up having an encounter with one of the retired reserve\n                  astronauts who did not go on the program we have\n                  got a fascinating story about that we actually met these people it is all very real it did happen it certainly did not\n                  happen like it was said on the website but there was something\n                  going on and just leaping ahead to what we will be talking about\n                  later on this afternoon we have a very interesting whistleblower\n                  who we are calling \u201cjake simpson some of you\n                  may have caught up with his testimony which we reported on\n                  just in the last 48 hours this was such an inconsequential remark that i did not\n                  even include it in the report i forgot about it we asked\n                  him over one of the many cups of tea and coffee that we had\n                  together i said hey you know that exchange program did that really happen and he said of course it did he said there\n                    are many of them voice wow wow which has always been my standpoint it is\n                  like if you assume the existence of visitors and you assume\n                  the establishment of communications then the next thing to\n                  do is that we go to their place you know with their help and of course this has happened we cannot prove it but\n                  that was the reality of the serpo story i became involved as a webmaster of course and i was the\n                  only available contact and that is why kerry interviewed\n                  me because kerry could not interview the real guys who\n                  were behind the scenes in the pentagon who were releasing\n                  this information in some kind of a drip-feed probably as a\n                  test to see how it would be received and what would happen and so on and so forth the story got trashed but we think it got trashed from the\n                  inside because of other people from the inside there is a lot of black hat white hat things going\n                  on behind the scenes pushing pulling about what is going\n                  to be released what is not going to be released they\n                  sabotage each other and disinform on each other just as much\n                  as they do us    which is really very interesting\n                  and it is true.voice how do you spell serpo s-e-r-p-o that was the supposed name of the planet which is also probably not true later on we got into a conversation\n                  with another whistleblower a very important guy in the history\n                  of camelot too somebody who we know very very well\n                  who we have given the pseudonym \u201chenry deacon which is a nod to one of the characters in the tv series eureka one of the very very first things that henry said to us as\n                  a criticism of the serpo project  where apparently\n                  a bunch of twelve american astronauts took nine months to visit\n                  a planet at zeta reticuli 2  henry just said it would not\n                  have taken nine months you know and then he started to talk to us about the beings that lived\n                  on the second and the third and the fifth planet at alpha\n                  centauri and so on and so forth and ok but let us not get out of order let us not get out of order thank you ok while i was doing this i had people writing to me and i had\n                  people writing to me because in my naivet\u00e9 i had presented\n                  myself as a kind of honest everyman who is just doing what\n                  i could do to help and i was not calling myself any alias i even put a picture myself up there so they could see that\n                  i was real.i just said look i do not know what is going\n                    on here i tried to be as intellectually honest as possible which is the kind of thing that kerry was talking about in\n                    the little interview that i did with her - it lasted about\n                    10 minutes but people started to write to me saying you know what i have got this incredible story and you sound like the\n                    kind of guy who might believe what i have to say i have not\n                    told anybody about this i had a lot of interesting messages from people many of which\n                  i have not ever published because they just do not\n                  go anywhere  just kind of weird anomalous encounters peculiar\n                  experiences funny stories to do with people\u2019s involvement\n                  in black ops there are many of those.one of these was somebody who said i had an interesting\n                    assignment he said when i was a young man working\n                    for an aerospace company in southern california he said that he was working as a graphic designer for an aerospace\n                  company that was contracted to the us government and he was\n                  asked if he would like to volunteer for a special assignment and he said sure what it is after he had signed his nda - his non-disclosure agreement\n                  - and given a secret clearance he was then told what the assignment\n                  was the assignment that he had never told anybody about for the\n                  20 years following that assignment except for his wife was\n                  that he had what for most of the people in this room would\n                  be a dream job  that for eight hours a day for six months five days a week he started his work in a sealed vault with\n                  a guard outside the door he would be given a mailbag a big mailbag which was padlocked with big padlocks he said the guard would come in would\n                  unlock the padlocks and then would leave would close the door and then his job was to sort out and archive and label what\n                  was in the mailbag what was in the mailbag was ufo documents films artifacts and videos between 1947 and the early 1980s when he did this that was his job for six months and he just said he just felt\n                  like this was you know he was just like a kid in a candy\n                  store he could not believe he was being asked to do this\n                  job and that is what he did he had so much stuff pass through his hands he never told\n                  anybody at all a lot of this stuff was sealed but he read\n                  everything he could he wrote to me and said this is my\n                  experience so i checked him out and i slowly drew information out of\n                  him very very gradually because i can kind of i mean we\n                  can kind of tell now somebody who is a real whistleblower a real whistleblower is not somebody who is just hey i have got this incredible story to tell let me tell you\n                  all about it a real whistleblower is somebody who writes to you with two\n                  lines of enigmatic information to see whether you are\n                  smart enough to figure out who they are you know that is\n                  actually how they work you know and we have missed one or two of those you know but we know\n                  we have missed them because they wrote to us again and\n                  we did not even notice the first e-mail you know because\n                  you get a little one-liner saying hey i had like\n                  to talk to you guys i have got something interesting to\n                  tell you you know.and it is like ok what does that mean now\n                  we pay attention to e-mails like that ok so this guy was waiting in the wings for camelot as it were and he became pretty much our first interviewee somebody who never had spoken to anyone else before on record\n                  and here were we doing a sort of disclosure project of\n                  our own.k ok so what happened was he did not want to\n                  go on camera so that was the beginning but we ended up meeting\n                  him meeting his wife spending time with them he was a really stellar individual and we determined to interview\n                  him but we figured out that you know he wanted his voice\n                  disguised and he wanted his back to the camera even later henry\n                  deacon would not even go on camera or have his voice\n                  recorded so in the case of mr x we did do the video and if you have\n                  been to our site you have obviously seen it hopefully it was pretty much our first video together although prior\n                  to that i had interviewed - because i not only interviewed\n                  bill - i was interviewing rich dolan stephen basset jim\n                  marrs bill hamilton and bill hamilton as part of my ufo documentary\n                  that i was putting together and bill hamilton is a witness\n                  who is absolutely fascinating he is one of the early we did put him on our camelot interviews and he is\n                  got numerous stories to tell if you are familiar with\n                  the field you know that he is a very well-respected researcher\n                  who goes back a long way i would encourage you if you have not seen his interview that you really ought to he is got some stories about\n                  calling in ufo craft before steven greer ever\n                  thought of it and also encounters with i guess you might\n                  say men-in-black who came to visit him and so on he is\n                  met some of the most amazing characters and researchers in\n                  the ufo field way back going way way way back tell them happened to mr x mr x unfortunately recently very recently has\n                  died he died unexpectedly we do not know the cause we were told we were called by his wife she was in a state by the way one of the things that mr x did was he did a\n                  recent audio interview he was beginning to get braver we were just speaking at the crash retrieval conference in\n                  vegas about a month ago and for that conference he did a short\n                  audio interview with me or both of us but it is my voice\n                  you hear on the audio and he was using his own voice he was\n                  coming out slowly but surely a little bit more he kept his wife and his family separate from this she is\n                  a lovely person she is quite aware spiritually and\n                  yet he felt great resistance from her she has a lot of fear and so he never quite involved her in sort of some of the\n                  things he was doing online sharing stories with people becoming\n                  braver as time went on at any rate he died of a sudden heart attack all of a sudden\n                  he in the middle of the night it was around christmas right before christmas i think he was supposed to go shopping he developed a headache he then took a couple aspirin he\n                  went shopping anyway at three of the clock in the morning he woke up he felt\n                  very unwell she took him to the hospital by 12:45 the following\n                  day he had passed on we do not know if it was a targeted hit we have not\n                  wanted to upset his wife by probing overtly into the matter however we do have some suspicions in this regard as the powers\n                  that be are very good at this sort of thing unbeknownst to most people he was thinking of going on coast and no one knows this except us and a few maybe close friends obviously we do not know if this had an effect we do not\n                  know if his intention riled somebody from our perspective and from his we felt that the fact that\n                  he had been involved in an aerospace company over 20 years\n                  ago looking at documents  it was really small potatoes \n                  that he would not be a target that it was old stuff and\n                  who could back it up because he had no evidence to present so we always felt that he was sort of under the wire as far\n                  as being a target.obviously we live on he is around he is gonna\n                  communicate i am sure with us as a group because we\n                  all kind of incarnate as groups as many of you may know so you know each of us has a mission and he certainly fulfilled\n                  his he was a wonderful loving soul and we want to pay tribute\n                  to him here at this conference by stating just that so that is\n                  it.now one thing i want to say here for anyone who has not\n                  been to our website  i am assuming most people have but we just never know  our mission is that we wanted to\n                  connect with truth-tellers and whistleblowers and researchers\n                  in the field of you know just across the board anything to do with the old\n                  paradigm and converting into the new paradigm that would have\n                  to do with things like free energy i mean almost nothing\n                  is off base for us you know we will go into the health field with health professionals ufo researchers with conspiracies with government we have\n                  interviewed people who have worked in black projects obviously and we are also interviewing people that are channeling certainly\n                  george is channeling channeling is a big aspect of the witnesses\n                  that we have interviewed it is something that has not\n                  been talked about much but it is something we are\n                  going into more in the future it is an important aspect there is remote viewing so we really cover a huge gamut yeah we have been called \u201cthe 7-eleven\n                  of the internet conspiracy movement in the\n                  sense that we have become a one-stop-shop where you can actually\n                  go and you can find out everything you need to find out or\n                  want to find out without actually having to go anywhere else and just as a moment of levity  this might even apply to\n                  some of you here we have had e-mails blaming us for a\n                  number of lost weekends that people have experienced when they have\n                  got drawn so deeply into our stuff that they could not\n                  get out of it it is become huge we have got 150 hours of videos\n                  there approximately everything is being transcribed some\n                  of it is being putting into other languages we have got\n                  audio versions we have done reports of our own and there is\n                  a whole bunch of stuff that we have not even talked about\n                  yet so it is really grown arms and legs but we do get people\n                  writing to us and please forgive this apparent self-promotion but it is really for the benefit of anyone here who is now\n                  coming up to speed with what it is that we are talking\n                  about here that we think and we have been told that we do\n                  have paradigm-changing information on our site.as i was saying earlier this was never something that we\n                  deliberately set out to do but it seems to have come that\n                  way exactly for the reasons that kerry just stated that we\n                  are reporting information from so many different sources that paradoxically and really interestingly only the black ops\n                  guys would really connect all this together in other words what has got consciousness to do with energy to do with multi-dimensional travel to do with et contact to do with possible health benefits that have been withheld\n                  from us all of this stuff is connected and the powers that\n                  be know this the real thing that stitches everything we have done together\n                  is that what we are trying to do is we are trying\n                  to set you free as it were with the truth\n                  that has been withheld from you the reason why this truth has been withheld from you is that\n                  there are people there who do not want you to be free that is the other side of the coin and so we are\n                  trying to reverse this i really loved brian\u2019s bumper-sticker reference yesterday\n                  morning when he said the truth will set you free but first\n                  of all it will piss you off i had actually make an even bigger bumper-sticker than\n                  that and say first of all it will freak you out and\n                  then it will piss you off and then it will set you\n                  free and i am going to put that on the\n                  site with brian\u2019s kind permission because that is\n                  so beautiful it is so true we get communications all the time from people who tell us\n                  basically what stage in this evolution in this progression that they are in whether they are freaked out whether\n                  they are pissed off or whether they are feeling\n                  liberated by it you know?we hear from people who say you know what i was freaked\n                    out last week but now i have read a lot more of your\n                    stuff and now i am cool so what can i do about it and this is of course the next thing that we are going\n                  to talk about we are going to go on to talk about later\n                  on this afternoon is what can we do this was brought out very well i think in the dialogue that\n                  we had yesterday with george green it is like ok now i am freaked out you know what do i do\n                  now about it you know is it all about saving myself what is it you know what do we do now what do we\n                  do with this information?and this is something that we want to talk about a little\n                  later on because we are very solution-oriented we are\n                  not trying to freak people out but the truth is where you\n                  have to start if you are lost in a jungle or even if you are\n                  lost in the streets of new york and you want to get somewhere\n                  else you have to know where you are in order to start\n                  beginning that journey you have to know where you are even if you do not like\n                  finding out where you are it is like you know what the truth is that i am here that applies metaphorically if any of you have come across\n                  difficult situations that you have suddenly encountered\n                  in relationships or in your business or with your family or\n                  anywhere else in life first of all you tell the truth then\n                  you say ok this is it now what do i do see it\n                  starts from there right so we basically are willing to tell you the\n                  truth about what is really going on and we have found\n                  that people have different tolerances we do understand this we have also been labeled \u201cnegative and this and\n                  that because we do tell the truth what has been going on around us  and it was depicted best i think in the matrix movie  is that everyone is\n                  in a matrix most people do not want to wake up from the\n                  matrix we are all about waking people up so that is\n                  kind of our mission once you get awakened absolutely you want to do something\n                  about it we are big proponents of encouraging people to do\n                  that on a consciousness level as well on a practical level we created a new website called project avalon projectavalon.net for those of you who have not been there that has a forum\n                  where people are connecting even as we speak creating safe\n                  places to go to as a result of some of the things they have\n                  learned because that is their choice on the other hand some are just building communities right\n                  where they live now they are just making connections and that was our intention that they would do that all around\n                  the world it is very very inspiring that it is\n                  actually happening on top of that project avalon does contain all kinds\n                  of information we are cataloging and gathering as i speak things about how to build a safe house where to go in the\n                  world what is safe comparing notes on that different\n                  soil conservation water  you name it ok?so this is just a very quick reminder to tell you that we\n                  have been making plans and helping others to start to make\n                  plans to create something new in the wake of what is now becoming\n                  a destruction of the old paradigm therefore we want to encourage you and let you know that\n                  everything that happens here at this conference any skill-sets any information that you want to share you can take it to\n                  our forum number one and also submit it just as research\n                  material if you are experts in certain areas we are gonna make all of that available there and we\n                  can certainly set up a section on vilcabamba in particular if that is what would be wanted so from here we can actually dig deeper into our witnesses but i want to find out where we are in time ok so what we are going to do now is an overview of\n                  what we call the big picture and this is the other thing that we want to say is that each\n                  witness has a piece of the puzzle and we unlike some people\n                  that do interviews - and there are other sites out there -\n                  we are not just gathering you know random interviews\n                  about this subject matter and piling them all into a big bundle we actually are on if you will a trail on a mystery we\n                  are collecting specific testimony that leads to a certain place and that is with an intention to reveal the entire big\n                  picture in one place this is actually where the power resides  not in knowing\n                  just a piece of the puzzle but knowing the whole big picture i have to say that the journey is not over that we feel\n                  that we have covered a great deal of the big picture some\n                  of it maybe very superficially the deeper we could go the\n                  happier we had be but we have been stopped at different\n                  intervals and we are going to talk about that we have also had our own \u201canomalous occurrences i will not call them overt threats that has not happened you know exactly  but we will describe that as well and we are going to have a huge question and answer session\n                  as well for all of this.i do want to say that one of our witnesses is here besides\n                  george green who was here yesterday that we have interviewed her name as all of you will know is miriam delicado and we are\n                  very very pleased that she was able to come and we want to do a special thanks - why not now to kay\n                  shepard and perry shepard for making this possible kay is\n                  a real mover and shaker and if it was not for kay we would\n                  not be here today because we have actually ran out of funds\n                   for financing camelot which is also financed\n                  up until now except for some donations for the past year so it is because of kay that we are here and we\n                  want to give her a great nod of thanks and so now what we had like to do is bill is the best\n                  at facts and figures he is the physics major he is the one who can do this the best so he will give\n                  you an overview of kind of the big picture and then we will\n                  do lunch and after that we will drill down deeper yeah i am the math and the physics\n                  guy one of the first experiences i had with kerry was when\n                  we had dinner together after our interview in laughlin kerry\n                  was kind enough to pick up the tab for that dinner a wonderful\n                  mexican dinner and when she was given the bill the check at the end of it i saw her you know with furrowed brow trying to figure this\n                  out she was just about to give this guy a $200 tip on her\n                  credit card and i said wait a minute you have got\n                  a couple of extra zeros on there since then we have had a running joke about kerry does not\n                  do zeros you know it is like you know is\n                  quito 100 miles 1000 miles you do not know you\n                  know but that is ok because i can handle that there is a very funny story as well in nairobi kenya where we were when we went off just before we were filming\n                  the cheetah and we needed a cup of coffee do you\n                  mind if i tell this story no that is fine we needed a cup of coffee this is the afternoon\n                  before we were about to go to nairobi airport to get the plane and i said hey you know we need to go we need this\n                  and we need that we probably need maybe you know 3,000 kenyan\n                  shillings or something you know and kerry  came back to the car in a state of deep\n                  distress she had 300,000 kenyan shillings that she got from\n                  this atm right from the atm it is like you know what is\n                    this zero you know anyway i have to say that the money started pouring out\n                   and i thought i had basically cleaned out the\n                  bank because they just kept coming and i was just i could not believe it i could not believe it either but it did not matter because a kenyan\n                  shilling as you have probably gathered is not very\n                  valuable and we were able to change it back and all this kind\n                  of stuff but since then i am the guy who handles the zeros you\n                  know meaning that i am the guy who takes care of the\n                  numbers and the math and the physics and i think brian this\n                  will probably make brian laugh.bo\u2019l that is true of us too i am not surprised and it is great and\n                  it is part of the dynamic that makes a great team actually you know because when kerry\u2019s got her head way up there\n                  in places where i cannot even see i have got my feet\n                  fairly close to the ground right we are kind of connected by some kind of a cord\n                  most of the time and that helps to keep things in balance so having said that now i want to tell you some pretty weird\n                  information because things started to come at us pretty thick\n                  and fast very soon after kerry\u2019s interview with bill\n                  hamilton which she was talking about just now which was back\n                  in 2006 bill hamilton as some of you may know is one of the people\n                  who was responsible for to his great credit for publicizing\n                  the story of dan burisch.voice wow and way back in 2002 when like you guys i was\n                  busy collecting privately and quietly all the information\n                  i possibly could about everything that i could \u2013 and you know before that i had read timothy good\u2019s above\n                  top secret and before that i was reading in 1988 and thinking wow supposing all this is true and before that i had\n                    had my own et experiences as probably many of you know but when bill hamilton published his own interview with dan\n                  burisch back in 2002 i saw that on the internet and something\n                  really hit me hard i thought this is amazing this man\n                  is telling a detailed and complex story about time-traveling\n                  future humans and some possible problem that is trying to be\n                  handled by these guys all behind the scenes and he is\n                  trying to tell this story i saw this video that bill hamilton had shot and an interview\n                  that he had done with dan burisch back in 2002 and it impressed\n                  the heck out of me and i just found myself thinking well first of all what\n                  i did is i e-mailed him and i was saying you know what you need to see this because there is something really\n                  special going on here i could not get it out of\n                  my mind and as with many of the people who have subsequently spoken\n                  to him and have been privileged enough now to even count as\n                  friends i found myself you know i had\n                  love to just to be able to go up to this guy in a conference\n                  and just say hi but it will never happen you know gee\n                  whiz these people are out there i mean of course since then things have moved along quite\n                  a lot and we are proud to consider dan one of our personal\n                  friends and we can talk to you a lot about some of the things\n                  that he has shared with us when we interviewed him i mean the first thing that happened\n                  was we immediately realized we immediately both realized that this guy  who is being disparaged all over the\n                  internet  we found him to be kind brilliant sensitive witty very humble and clearly possessing a huge depth of\n                  knowledge about some experiences that he had some of which\n                  were deeply troubling to him to integrate we got this very very quickly  this guy is absolutely rock-solid\n                  in his testimony we were very very privileged at a very early\n                  stage to be able to release a three-part video with dan burisch\n                  that we did and i think it was august was it august 2006 somewhere about there his story for those of you who do not know it i mean we can go into this in a little bit more detail later because\n                  it is one of the threads one of the main threads in\n                  the whole tapestry that we later came to call the big picture which is like what is this all about what is it that makes\n                  this time special what is it that is going on what is\n                  the et connection why is it that all of this is so complicated\n                  and so secret?those of you who were here yesterday would have remembered\n                  my contribution when we were sitting talking the four of us at the end of the day talking about what bill birnes had\n                  said about his own conversation with admiral george hoover\n                  from the office of navel intelligence before george hoover\n                  died george hoover who bill birnes described as \u201cthe philip\n                  corso of the navy said that one of the big secrets\n                  was that the roswell visitors back in 1947 that they were not\n                  little bug-eyed aliens from another planet  they were us\n                  from the future they were time-traveling future humans this is really the start of the complex web of problems entangled\n                  problems that the american government and other governments\n                  have been grappling with ever since and have chosen for whatever\n                  reasons not to tell us about because they did not think\n                  that we could handle the truth well actually i have to say that the reason that\n                  there is a big picture and the reason of where we are\n                  going with all of this is obviously in the direction of 2012 these few years that we are in now and beyond going\n                  up until what we understand may be around 2017 and further so we are actually aware at this point that the big picture\n                  points somewhere and that these aliens that were coming here\n                  had a mission they were here because they wanted to prevent catastrophe\n                   a catastrophe that had happened in the past and that resulted\n                  in what according to dan burisch was the\n                  splitting of the human race into various factions that then\n                  took off some of which went underground some took off for\n                  other planets and maybe you can carry it on from\n                  there yeah the essence of dan burisch\u2019s information\n                  was that just as kerry said there were various groups of\n                  future humans with different future lineages who had encountered\n                  a catastrophe in their history and that prompted by what seems\n                  to be the altruistic intentions of a group which in dan burisch\u2019s\n                  shorthand he calls the p52ks  p52s\n                  refers to \u201cpresent plus 52,000 years these guys said dan were from 52,000 years in the future some of them one of the groups the group that was responsible\n                  for initiating the retrospective time-traveling intervention\n                  attempt were human-looking were very spiritual were very\n                  well-intentioned towards us were being very careful in their\n                  approaches and he regarded them as best he knew from his\n                  own self-confessed limited information as nordics now there may be many nordic races and the whole\n                  thing is a huge complexity we later on had testimony from\n                  witnesses such as clifford stone and others and just as i think it was george yesterday made reference to them - many many many different races and the whole thing is incredibly\n                  complicated so the summary of that story is that dan burisch was reporting\n                  from his first-hand experience working as a microbiologist\n                  in s-4 of area 51 when he had the personal encounters with\n                  one of these beings  not one of the nordic beings but one of the other guys who had a degenerate genome whether the genome degenerates or not in\n                  this future timeline depended on whether you go underground\n                  to avoid the catastrophe or whether you leave the planet to\n                  avoid the catastrophe the guys who left the planet straight off ended up in good\n                  shape the guys who stayed underground for a while did not and that is quite interesting now of course what we see is we do see a sort of what\n                  i would call a vector what i would call it looks like the\n                  same sorts of things are happening there seems to be some\n                  kind of instinct for the powers that be to tunnel underground\n                  when they feel danger coming according to the future humans testimony that might\n                  not be such a smart thing to do and we have got some really\n                  interesting testimony about that which we will report on\n                  later on this afternoon from our most recent witness who we are\n                  calling \u201cjake simpson we will close off in just one or two minutes because\n                  this information from dan burisch was so fantastical it left\n                  us with a sort of conflict it is like could this\n                  really be true and yet this guy was absolutely straight out we spent a lot\n                  of time with him on and off camera and we felt that we believed\n                  his information although it was impossible to believe and\n                  we also felt that this guy was absolutely credible in terms\n                  of his sincerity later on just a few weeks after that we met another guy\n                  who has become very very central in the camelot timeline as it were we called him \u201chenry deacon which\n                  was named after the brilliant polymath in the tv series eureka henry deacon is an electronics engineer highly qualified multidisciplinary brilliant man very spiritual very anguished because it is quite hard to go through these experiences\n                  these people go through  whether you are a black ops\n                  insider like henry whether you are dan working with an\n                  alien in area 51 or whether you are george working with\n                  the bankers or even whether you are brian with the experiences\n                  that you have had it is hard to emerge from all of this without scars and\n                  things that you think about deeply late at night sometimes you know and we need to understand these guys and the compassion\n                  that they require in order to understand their experiences we mortals are not necessarily well equipped to understand\n                  what they have been through but henry had the courage to talk to us  in a very noisy\n                  pizza hut with his cell phone battery removed from his cell\n                  phone that was the first time that we had heard that that\n                  was a smart thing to do he knew a whole bunch of stuff and he started telling us\n                  things that sounded a little bit like what dan was saying he was starting talking about time travel and he started talking\n                  about a catastrophe and he started talking about some of the\n                  things that he knew and we said to him look this sounds\n                  like dan burisch\u2019s story and he did not know\n                  who dan burisch was.now we said to him  and we will talk about henry\u2019s\n                  testimony after lunch he has a whole bunch of stuff to report he is been to mars he is been to the mars base ok we will tell you about that.but what we asked henry to do we said look go and listen or go and watch our video with dan and tell us what you\n                    think he got back to us three weeks later saying dan burisch\n                    is telling the whole truth timelines and all ok?that was a really important independent corroboration for\n                  us that there is something very real very important and that this is one of the biggest secrets that there is\n                  a complexity of possible future timelines which the powers\n                  that be are trying to get information about are trying to\n                  manipulate there are push-me pull-you factions some of them are actually\n                  trying to steer us right into the wreck there are others who\n                  are trying to avoid it and we have got a whole bunch of ets who are standing\n                  by some of whom are trying to help some of whom are watching and some of whom are trying to take advantage of the situation\n                  by picking up the resources when it is all over.henry told us a whole bunch of stuff about this which i think\n                  we will go on to talk about after lunch that\n                  feels like a pre-lunch wrap to me what do you think ok yeah absolutely very close i just want to\n                  say that the catastrophe according to dan burisch may have\n                  been averted he had a device called the looking glass that\n                  we will talk more about we have done subsequent interviews with him had subsequent\n                  meetings with him and his sort of side-kick marci mcdowell who is a known operative from mj12  what is no longer called\n                  mj12 but definitely the organization exists dan was also\n                  working for mj12 that is another important note.so the story\u2019s complex elements of disinformation\n                  may exist within it i would not question that where they\n                  exist is another matter and it is a huge puzzle as i\n                  said to put all together but it is important to just\n                  have the caveat that the catastrophe as seen in looking\n                  glass that there are elements of it which appear to have been\n                  mitigated at this time so what happened just before the break before\n                  lunch is that we ran out of camera tape just as i was trying\n                  to come to my punchline so i am just going to repeat\n                  that because actually it is quite an important little\n                  note for people to ponder on.just to recap where we were at was talking about this whole\n                  complex issue of alternative uncertain un-predetermined potential future timelines and the future humans concerns\n                  about that - and the governments and the militaries of the\n                  world\u2019s concerns about that once they first became aware\n                  of the potential problems probably back as early as the second\n                  world war so we have been told.to illustrate that point i had mentioned that we have been\n                  told by our most recent witness jake simpson who is\n                  been on our website for the last 48 hours or so and this was he is told us so much stuff that all the time we are\n                  remembering things that we had not included in our little\n                  report one of these things is just a little offhand remark he said there is\n                    a nasa satellite which has recently been launched with a\n                    trillion dollars-worth of equipment on it that is a lot of money to put in a satellite you ask\n                  anyone from wall street even kerry knows that is a lot\n                  of zeros i had to do that for the camera it is\n                  a joke now this guy knows how much a trillion dollars is it was not\n                  a throw-away remark a trillion is a trillion and a billion\n                  is a billion you know this is a trillion the point is that the powers that be do not put a trillion\n                  dollars-worth of stuff in space that is going to burn\n                  up into nothing when it eventually re-enters the atmosphere if they knew what was going to come you spend a trillion dollars\n                  on a piece of equipment up there when you do not know\n                  what is going to happen.and if they do not know what is going to\n                  happen we do not know what is going to happen and\n                  that means that the game is uncertain un-predetermined and\n                  therefore open to be affected by ourselves if we so wish anyone who knows anything about quantum indeterminacy knows\n                  that consciousness is king and this is where the real world\n                  of physics interfaces with the world of the esoteric.i think brian would be one of the first people in this room\n                  to agree that you cannot embark on this string-trail of exploration research and discovery \u2013 even as a physicist  if you are\n                  intellectually honest it will lead you into spiritual realms\n                  and there is absolutely no escape from that would you\n                  agree with that brian?bo\u2019l that is certainly correct yes.bo\u2019l you might want to hold the microphone up\n                  a little higher let us see how is that how is that\n                  working br b\u2019ol kc discussion on how to hold the microphone audience laughter]\u00a0 what we needed was a princeton ph.d to straighten\n                  this out so the issue here which we are going\n                  to be talking about for a lot of the rest of the afternoon is what might happen?we do not have any definitive inside information of the\n                  nature that george green was saying yesterday we have not\n                  got anyone saying to us whether they are worldly or unworldly that you know what world war three is going to start\n                  on the 1st of april i do not know anything that says that world war three is not going\n                  to start on the 1st of april but we are going to be discussing\n                  in an open sort of way that things do seem to be changing that the future does not seem to be known and that the push-me pull-you sort of tug-of-war between the different influences both planetary and off-planet is one of the things that is\n                  making this game uncertain interesting and influentiable\n                  at the moment so what we want to do is continue on drilling down\n                  with our various witness testimony and again the strength\n                  here is not just that we have whistleblower testimony as well\n                  as researcher as well as even channeled information but that\n                  we are putting it all together in one place and adding\n                  it up so you know two plus two equals four or five whatever so that is where the strength is in camelot and\n                  that is what we are doing here for you today.so under that heading what i want to tell you about is that\n                  over a year ago we sat down with dan and marci in las vegas\n                  in a private meeting along with by the way and i am\n                  not going to name him but a television producer who wanted\n                  to bring our project camelot to the screen as a television\n                  show he was working has been working for the past year to\n                  do so we originally had a deal with the history channel they then\n                  decided from some higher-up about a week later the word\n                  came down that right when they are about to sign a deal\n                  with us for a two-hour pilot show basically you know nixed\n                  the deal and said no we would be a threat to their show ufo\n                  hunters as if they had not thought of that before\n                  they made the offer.so at any rate nothing has happened in regard to that but\n                  the interesting thing that went on between dan and marci and\n                  the television producer and us was that dan had come back from\n                  an intensive time working again with majestic under whatever\n                  name you want to call them and basically with looking glass and that all bets were then off as of over a year ago.their time-travel technology that is telling the future -\n                  which is an alien back-engineered device - was basically telling\n                  them the probabilities of things that were going to happen we had a whole report as to what certain things would be happening\n                  and how it would roll out dan was telling us these things.one of those things was that hillary clinton would be president\n                  and that she would be killed in office now as you know that\n                  has not happened that is not what the timeline actually how it played out a year later.there are several other things that we were told that were\n                  predicted in looking glass that have not transpired nodding\n                  at bill ryan] and you can add to this it was a very important meeting and it is very important\n                  for you guys to know about it because what is happening here\n                  is that you have got these scientists and you know black\n                  project - these people that are basically into power positions\n                  on the planet - using special technology to look into the future and they are actually turning out wrong ok that means that there is something else at work on the\n                  planet and that we are all a part of it that is\n                  rolling out in a different way.voice whoo hoo let me drill down a little bit more into what kerry just to summarize she is quite right in emphasizing\n                  that this is so very important to understand this to understand the way that the powers\n                  that be have been using the power that they gained probably\n                  as early as 1947 we heard from a couple of sources that one of the things that\n                  was retrieved from the roswell crash was some sort of ah even henry deacon could not put this properly into words.it was like it was ah it was a very clever gadget highly\n                  advanced which was connected with their ability to navigate\n                  in time to control where they were in time to know where\n                  they were in time and you can use that kind of thing to see\n                  what is going to happen or has happened it is like a sort of ah these are my own words here some sort of interdimensional interface between where one happens\n                  to be and when one happens to be and the entire flow of time\n                  that enables one to control and to perceive something like\n                  that.now of course you need to imagine what happened back in\n                  1947 when this interesting gadget was retrieved by a bunch\n                  of interested air force physicists they start playing with\n                  it when they start playing with it you are really giving no offence to any individuals here but it is part of\n                  the human condition i guess that if you give human beings\n                  a dangerous toy then they are going to start playing\n                  with it and they may start doing some damage with it just\n                  as children would.what seems to have happened as far as we can gather is that\n                  that created a major tangle it created a tangle in timelines\n                  that even though the future humans were trying to come back to\n                  do something to help avert this catastrophe what was unplanned\n                  by them what made the tangle even worse was that that intervention\n                  attempt immediately went wrong because the craft crashed because\n                  of the new high-powered radar they had in white sands i think\n                  it was based which is why these disks started crashing in\n                  the first place because they could not actually interface\n                  with the radar.the timeline problem then became even more complicated because\n                  you were giving the government the ability to see into the\n                  future and to look at possibilities and probabilities of what\n                  might start to happen and then that just makes the tangle\n                  even worse it is extremely hard to lay this out in a kind of comprehensive\n                  paragraph but you probably get the idea this is one of the\n                  secrets that has not been told the reference to the project that happened in the latter half\n                  of 2007 is that dan took a so-called sabbatical dan burisch\n                  took a so-called sabbatical for the best part of six months i mean he was really out of communication we did not\n                  know where he was on the 10th of december he met with us in las vegas the fact\n                  that this other guy was a tv producer was just incidental he happened to be along he was a friend he just sat with\n                  his jaw on the floor for five hours as dan debriefed to us\n                  what had been perceived the purpose of this project that happened back in 2007 was\n                  because the what had been communicated to the american government\n                  by the future humans was that the man-made stargate and looking\n                  glass technology  which is the same kind of stuff  it involves a stargate is a stargate as anyone knows who is\n                  been watching tv it is something that you can step through\n                  and you end up in a different place or a different time it\n                  enables one to travel we will talk a little bit more about\n                  that later because this technology does exist.a looking glass is the colloquial name given to the\n                  same device used just simply as a way to look through it and\n                  see what is on the other side you do not need to\n                  travel you just take a look so it becomes like the high-tech version of a crystal ball where you get to look and see what is happening except\n                  that it is not quite as simple as that because what you\n                  see apparently or with the information that is retrieved comes over brings hints of probabilities and possibilities and the details of that process we are not given to know.but in that project sorry let me back up a second there\n                  because this is complex the future humans told the american government that the catastrophe\n                  which was in their history  and this is where this stuff\n                  starts to interface with the whole 2012 mythology and concern\n                  that has been building up over the last few years  is that\n                  there seems to have been a catastrophe in this timeline in\n                  dan\u2019s own words round about now ok he did not give a date we do not know whether it is\n                  going to happen tomorrow morning whether it is going\n                  to happen in 2012 or whether it is going to happen as\n                  late as 2020 or whether it does not happen at all on\n                  this timeline.so there is something that happened \u2019round about\n                  now in the future humans history and apparently according\n                  to their analysis the reason for this was because the earth\n                  was traveling through a particular area of energized space from memory i believe that he described this energized space\n                  as containing micro-wormholes and the man-made stargates and\n                  looking glasses caused an amplifying effect on this energy on this energetic space and that is what caused\n                  the earth to wobble that is what caused the pole shift\n                  to happen.so this is all very useful information \u00a0 well actually you should bill and kerry tussle\n                  for the microphone this is extremely important thirty seconds what i want you to do is talk to them about the\n                  different kind of shifts there is a magnetic and there is\n                  a pole explain that yeah wait this is a reference to the\n                  leash you know the important thing to understand here is that the future\n                  humans said that what you have got to do to stop this\n                  from happening is you have got to dismantle these devices you have got to decommission these devices all you have got to do is first of all you unplug\n                    them then you turn them off and then to be really safe\n                    you split them up into three different components and make\n                    sure they are stored up with different military organizations\n                    in different parts of the world ok apparently this was done and then the reason why they\n                  went into this project in the latter half of 2007 is once\n                  you have done all that once you have decommissioned\n                  these devices then it is like well now what has\n                  this worked we do not know we have got to take another\n                  look they did take another look they took another look using a\n                  different kind of technology that they have for looking into\n                  the future what they found was something which they evaluated\n                  as the most probable timeline - was something which was labeled timeline\n                  1 variant 83 and that is really interesting ok but you did not tell them i am\n                  not really good at physics so this is why i wanted you to\n                  explain to them ok about the magnetic see because what happens\n                  is there is different levels of catastrophe if you have\n                  a pole shift or a magnetic pole shift it does different things\n                  to the planet and this is where it gets into how many humans\n                  are eliminated in the process ok yeah right on our apologies for\n                  that this happens all the time by the way when i am\n                  off camera and the reason for this is because this is not\n                  a linear story you see it is not like saying ok this is what happened on my holidays this is day one and\n                  this is day two this goes everywhere it is not a linear story everything\n                  connects with everything else and this is of course exactly\n                  the problem that george green had in telling his story yesterday it does not go in a straight line.now ok so we bookmark that and we will go back to that\n                  in just a moment what kerry was referring to there is the\n                  difference between a physical pole shift and a magnetic pole\n                  reversal these are two different things one way to illustrate that actually is to refer to a piece\n                  of testimony that we received from somebody who was really\n                  in a position to know which we have never publicized we have talked about it but we have not put it on\n                  our site because there was not enough information to make\n                  it a kind of big deal it was just another piece of the puzzle\n                  that fits with everything else and this happened do you remember what i said just before lunch i said that\n                  the most interesting e-mails we get are the ones that are just\n                  one line we got an email from somebody who said great\n                  site i love your work keep it up and then signed it\n                  with his name and i thought wait a minute i know that name but\n                  it was a common name it was not like it was not\n                  such a complicated name that you would figure out that this\n                  could only be the one person there are probably a number of\n                  people called brian o\u2019leary for example it is\n                  not that uncommon.and so if this person brian o\u2019leary  it was not\n                  brian you know \u2013 who it is like are you\n                  that brian o\u2019leary are you that are you the person\n                  i think you are he wrote back and said yes i am and anybody could\n                  have said that but we checked out the email address and the\n                  ip address and all that kind of stuff and this was the man this guy was somebody who is a brilliant scientist whose\n                  name would be known to half of the people in this room somebody\n                  who brian probably knows and we can tell him in private and we felt that we should never actually release his name\n                  because that was not what he was trying to do he was\n                  just trying to say hey i love your site he is\n                  on the internet and i paid very close attention once i realized\n                  that this guy\u2019s writing to us i said to him very much on impulse you probably know\n                    something which might be of interest to us and our visitors\n                    to our website is there anything about what is going\n                    to happen in the next few years that you would like us to\n                    know he said yes he said i am limited about\n                    what i can say but i do not like to be the bearer\n                    of bad news but we are going to have a very tough time this is really quite significant because he did not he was not trying to feed us a disinformation he was\n                  just somebody who said hey i like your site we\n                  could easily not have picked up on this i just happened to\n                  notice it and i figured out that this is the man so i asked\n                  him and he said i hate to be the bearer of bad news there\n                    are three things that are going to be happening in the next\n                    few years he said the first thing is there is going to be a coronal\n                  mass ejection and he referenced  and this is a little\n                  bit of homework for all you guys to do  he referenced the\n                  event of 1859 go look it up quite interesting huge solar storms all over the world if there had been any\n                  kind of electro-magnetic grid in 1859 it would have been wiped\n                  out ok but it was not they just had auroral displays\n                  as far north and south as the equator spectacular sunsets\n                  for two or three days and everyone said wow look at\n                  the colors in that sky that is incredible ok so coronal mass ejections are when the sun has a hissy\n                  fit and it kind of throws something at the earth that interacts\n                  with the magnetosphere ionized particles hitting the atmosphere all kinds of stuff going on up there nowadays that would\n                  be really bad news if that happened he did not say how he\n                  knew this is really interesting to the physicists amongst you because you know that the sun randomly ejects all kinds of\n                  stuff in any random direction it is a little bit like\n                  a cowboy shooting off a six-shooter spinning wildly around\n                  in circles and kind of firing randomly all around him if the earth happens to be in the way then that is bad\n                  news but it probably would not be in the way he said\n                  this was going to happen we do not know how he knew ok that was event number one he said this would start in 2009 ok here we are january the 11th  boriska\u2019s birthday by the way i forgot to mention that that is an aside.voice who was it boriska let us go into that later boriska kipriyanovich the indigo child ok.then he said there would be a magnetic pole reversal a magnetic\n                  pole reversal which is already underway he stated this in\n                  such a way that it would be significantly important for us\n                  to understand why later on  and this is just a footnote to that  henry deacon our physicist black ops insider source helped us to understand\n                  that as far as he was aware the shifting magnetic field in\n                  the earth is something that affects consciousness we are all electrical beings we are souls in electrical bodies\n                  that are dependant upon the neurological bio-electric activity\n                  of the brain and the body in order to function well.if you have got something so profound as the earth\u2019s\n                  magnetic field that starts doing weird things then human beings\n                  are going to start doing weird things too and so are dolphins and so are whales and so are all kinds of animals all over\n                  the world.henry said have you noticed that in the last 10 15 years there is been increasing conflict more people are misunderstanding\n                    each other there are more people who seem to be going crazy there are more people who seem to be behaving in irrational strange ways not connecting with each other he said this has all got to do with the change in the earth\u2019s\n                  magnetic field and that \u2013 suddenly it did a big click\n                  with me personally i thought now i understand ok?but a magnetic pole reversal is not going to it is not\n                  necessarily going to spoil your whole day it is happening\n                  already as best i understand brian could probably help us\n                  understand this better when we talk to him tomorrow about all\n                  this.then the third event he said was the big one he said third finally there would be a pole shift.voice a pole shift a pole shift a pole shift is a physical pole\n                  shift a pole shift is when the earth was like that [indicating\n                  upright with his hand] and it goes boomf like that [rotates\n                  his hand it suddenly shifts any geologist will tell you this has happened many times before most of you know what this is it is a physical shift\n                  in the orientation of the earth relative to its rotation around\n                  the sun but it causes things like tsunamis continents shifting going under the water atlantis for example - pole shift and what it is caused by i am not sure that they\n                  know but among other things the interesting thing that is happening\n                  here is that we are telling you about a scientist who\n                  is highly highly respected ok and who has suddenly been\n                   he told us this much  asked to come on board to work for of all places homeland security.voice ooh this is a man who is published on the web who was\n                  clearly actually sort of anti-government was something of\n                  a rebel in his own right again still maintained his respectability\n                  because of the level of scientist that he was or is so it\n                  was very valuable that he would even come back on an email\n                  like that revealing that much all he did was list three things that were gonna happen the\n                  fact that he worked for homeland security and the fact that\n                  he could not say anything more and that is the last i believe we wrote back to him obviously and that is\n                  the last we heard from him.now this is happening at the same time that we are getting\n                  the information from dan burisch so you see how - and henry\n                  deacon and so as we pull these threads together these people coming from completely different directions with completely\n                  different motivations are coming to us with the same story right so now tell them what dan told us exactly our source did finally he apologized\n                  for not being able to say more he said that we were the first\n                  people he had communicated with outside the national security\n                  community for a number of years we took that as a great compliment it was a risk that he was taking on his own part he said as\n                  much as he could.going back to what dan said now this guy communicated with\n                  us from memory it was \u2019round it was in the middle\n                  of dan\u2019s project it was around about the middle of 2007 some of the whistleblowers who speak to us do not have\n                  up-to-date information where they hear it they have their\n                  own grapevines they have their own rumor-mills they do not\n                  necessarily come straight from a briefing that they had that\n                  morning ok so it is not necessarily up-to-date information.just to backtrack to where we were with dan and the story\n                  of these man-made stargates and looking glasses needing to\n                  be decommissioned because that was what was going to cause\n                  the catastrophe and then wait a minute we have got\n                  to check to see whether this has worked and then they\n                  took another look using an alien device what they saw was that the most probable timeline was the\n                  following now in terms of nomenclature the catastrophic\n                  timeline which the future humans reported that they had experienced\n                  was known as timeline 2 i do not know why it was not\n                  called timeline 1 but it was called timeline 2 ok?timeline 1 is the other one when that does not happen ok so i will be on timeline 1 or i will be on\n                  timeline 2 is as important as knowing whether you are\n                  heading north or you are heading south it is a pretty\n                  important distinction to make the first thing that they established in that time portal\n                  intelligence probe which i think is what dan called it formally is that we are on timeline 1 that is the good news ok the catastrophe he reported had been averted we are\n                  on timeline 1.and so once you figure out there is not going to be\n                  a catastrophe the next question for a curious scientist is well ok what is going to happen then ok and then this is\n                  the variant 83 part when they started to drill down\n                  into the detail about what would be happening in the next few\n                  years but i want to say that interestingly and this\n                  is on our site most of this information so you do not\n                  need to be taking notes and we will be taping this as well\n                  for release dan said we were in an interview with him at one point and we said ok that is\n                    great and then he said but there is no free\n                    lunch and then he proceeded to tell us what that meant basically timeline 1 variant 83 contained things like nuclear\n                  war and you know other fairly dire predictions among which as i said hillary was in office was going to die in office he had highly respected her i have to back up there is one other part that you guys\n                  need to know which is about the yellow book the\n                  technology  allows the world leaders to see their own\n                  future and then plot their lives accordingly to the best version\n                  of that future that is part of the reason why they are highly\n                  successful and remain so because they are actually cheating in regards to hillary what dan said is that she was one of\n                  the people that had access to this technology was given the\n                  yellow book and looked into her future and saw that she was\n                  going to be assassinated in office she was he said  this\n                  is his story  willing to go into office knowing that she\n                  would be assassinated and therefore she had garnered his respect and this was you know back over a year ago now it is now the 11th of january and obama\u2019s\n                  inauguration is in nine days time so it is a pretty\n                  safe bet to conclude that wherever we are at the moment we are\n                  not on variant 83 that has not happened this is the\n                  good news ok this is more good news and it is more good news in the sense that that package\n                  of information that was called variant 83 that was evaluated\n                  as being the most probable future visible at that time it\n                  did contain bad news it did contain a war against iran that\n                  was predicted to start in october last october ok that did not\n                  happen there was a nuclear exchange between india and pakistan the\n                  jury\u2019s out ok there would be a financial collapse that was triggered in\n                  that timeline by the iran war well the financial collapse\n                  is probably planned anyway ok set off it is a kind\n                  of controlled demolition of the economy which was set in place\n                  long before which most of the people here know about which\n                  george already spoke about extensively yesterday and he said that this war that was seen it would last through\n                  until 2010 russia and china would become involved and it\n                  was all pretty bad news and you know based on that reality vilcabamba sounds like a pretty good place to be and we are\n                  actually marching in step with what george said but hillary is not the president the war with iran\n                  did not happen in october we are not on that timeline and\n                  if we are not on that timeline it means that we do not\n                  know what is going to happen next we do not know it\n                  is not known we have not spoken to anyone who does know and if i had been a betting man i would have placed quite\n                  a lot of money in a black kind of way as it were maybe\n                  this does not sound too good actually this is unethical i think we had so many parallel information points that in terms\n                  of data-clustering on a graph everything pointed to something\n                  happening last october you know everything happened we were\n                  all watching it you know something that we have already spoken about publicly is that\n                  our guy henry deacon at the end of september he told us\n                  that he had received a telephone call he said he is never\n                  received a telephone call like this in his life he was asked\n                  to report for duty in the middle east the next morning ok he said he was almost ordered to do it except they could not\n                  actually order him to he was asked in a way that he almost\n                  could not refuse the rate of pay was $800 an hour without overtime ok and\n                  that is a very great amount of money even in that field it is quite a lot of money he turned it down to his\n                  very great credit he said i do not want any part\n                  of this he was never told why he was asked to report\n                  for duty in the middle east why we do not know nothing\u2019s happened in the\n                  middle east yet except that something seems to be cranking\n                  up whether that fire is going to burn out on its own or whether\n                  it is going to crank up into something much bigger we\n                  do not know this is the conversation we had yesterday ok but we have had whistleblower testimony that\n                  we have not been able to release in total - some of which we\n                  did release - from a witness who supposedly was in close communication\n                  with the illuminati who was saying that their agenda was rolling\n                  out just as planned and that he was basically going underground\n                  and would not be able to communicate further we have been\n                  talking back and forth with this man for over a year i have to tell you also that he was basically saying you\n                  know the dire somewhat dire agenda depending on how you\n                  want to look at it which includes things like elimination\n                  of the population that george was talking about most everything that george enumerated yesterday was going\n                  along and that it was absolutely - it may be behind schedule\n                  - but that it was shortly to sort of ratchet up on top of that we have had other whistleblowers from behind\n                  the scenes coming forward saying things are on schedule we also have someone who we have been in communication\n                  with for over possibly even as much as two years who is\n                  a good friend of alex collier and he has been telling us about\n                  his information that he has from some nsa sources that has\n                  basically geared him up to building an underground base in\n                  an undisclosed location he has told us about the queen of england who has now got\n                  an underground base being built in part of colorado so there\n                  are and he is also a very wealthy man i cannot\n                  tell you how he made his money because that is a highly\n                  controversial matter but he basically said that he knew when\n                  the banks were gonna go on bank holiday as george does and\n                  he is been in constant contact with us what is interesting in all this mix is that some of these\n                  people coming forward seem to all be agreeing on at least the agenda we have not talked about bill deagle bill deagle is\n                  somebody who is highly controversial who is a doctor a medical doctor who is on the web you may know of him you may have seen our interview with him people you know ranted and raved at us for having interviewed\n                  him because they felt he is too negative they did not\n                  want to hear it they think he could possibly be programmed he is been given testimony from other whistleblowers\n                  that we have not - as their doctor in working in black\n                  projects - that outline you know a laundry list of their\n                  plans and their agenda just as george has been telling you it involves eliminating the population using viruses to do\n                  so and you know when where how and so on he is also highly intuitive and feels he has channeled\n                  information that tells him certain things one of which was\n                  october that october was gonna be when this whole thing kind\n                  of came under way well actually it appears  ok i have to say\n                  it appears that he has been incorrect at least thus\n                  far we have got david wilcock who is a well-known psychic\n                  intuitive who is also highly scientific and has a very\n                  well-known website called divinecosmos.com who\n                  can give you the scientific basis for what is going on what he feels is the heating of the planets he works with\n                  hoagland and i am sure many of you are familiar with\n                  richard hoagland so what happens is we get all this testimony and some of\n                  it is corroborative some of it is not some of it is conflicting what is interesting is that it is almost like you know maybe this is a slightly cold analogy but it is\n                  almost like watching a game in which there are predictions\n                  as to which side\u2019s gonna win we are getting people\n                  that are sort of calling the shots and calling the plays if\n                  you will but i have to say that when it appears that something has not\n                  happened for example in october there are a number of reasons\n                  why that might be the case it does not actually necessarily\n                  mean that certain things have not happened it could mean that these viruses have been put in place it\n                  could mean that they have been activated it could mean\n                  they are not showing up yet it could mean we need another\n                  six months to see that if you talk to bill deagle that is\n                  probably what he will say on the other hand it could mean the white hats in\n                  the government  and this is a very important part of it \n                  have been successful there has been from what i understand even in the last year something of a coup in our government in the united states which is not necessarily i mean obama\u2019s a front-man\n                  and he was long prophesied or planned to be the leader at\n                  this time however there is reason to believe that there are people part of which is majestic 12 - from our understanding with\n                  dan and marci - that are working and are white hats and do not\n                  want to see the elimination of the population some of the majestic 12 are absolutely part of the illuminati\n                  and they do want to see these things happen so you have got fighting in the ranks and the fact that\n                  we are up here telling you all this is testimony to the\n                  fact  if you talk to jake simpson if you talk to dan burisch\n                   that we have people or friends in high places that are allowing\n                  us to do so because they are actually white hats so it is\n                  a really important ingredient in all of what we are saying i think this i am just kind of taking pause\n                  to think where we should go next with this at the moment shall\n                  we go into jake simpson that sounds good ok jake simpson was somebody who we met on our\n                  long month-long there-and-back australia trip when we were\n                  invited to speak at the nexus conference in brisbane\n                  in october and on that trip we met a whole bunch of people\n                  when we were on koh samui koh samui is a beautiful island\n                  in thailand anybody been there koh samui wow ok it is a fabulous place it is a little bit like\n                  vilcabamba inasmuch as quite a number of people quite a long\n                  time ago passed through there and then thought wow what\n                  a wonderful place to stay it is full of ex-pats and it is got its own sort\n                  of alternative community but they do have the equivalent of\n                  those interstate freeways going through the valleys sadly and it is been pretty much trashed and of course one\n                  of the reasons why it is been trashed is because they\n                  built an airport that is the end.b we do not want that here yes anyway beside the point koh samui  there\n                  we were we met jake simpson and the first preface that i\n                  want to make to this information it is all on our site we wrote up as much as we could well we wrote up as much\n                  as we could remember we spent three days or maybe it was even four days with\n                  this man and his family and his children and he is a\n                  delightful brave man one of the first things he said to us was that when he first\n                  encountered our information he was not sure if we were \u201creal or\n                  not he used his own intelligence-gathering contacts\n                  to check us out he looked me in the eye he said i checked you out so\n                    i know everything about your life you have got nothing\n                    to worry about he said it is all cool he\n                    said i know that you have been telling the truth and then the other thing he said the next thing he said was anyone else who is ever tried to do exactly what\n                  you are doing has been killed so i really admire your\n                  courage and this guy\u2019s a warrior \u2013 ok in the jedi\n                  tradition he is quite a remarkable man and that was a\n                  very high compliment from him that he should be respecting\n                  our courage and just to loop back into what we were talking about earlier\n                  on when we first started before lunch we are not standing\n                  up here trying to be courageous we are just having fun\n                  and doing what happens naturally and we are just saying well this is who we are we have got nothing to hide it is\n                  the bill and kerry show and so on and so forth a lot of people are saying wow you are so great but actually one of the things that i think unites kerry and\n                  myself very strongly is that i have no fear do\n                  you have any fear no i actually do not and i will address\n                  that briefly as sort of a sidelight but basically the weird\n                  thing about us embarking on this journey is that we both happen\n                  to be the kind of personalities i guess it is a personality\n                  type that sort of go forward in a very optimistic way and\n                  we just do not look over our shoulder we tend to just do what we do and then you know whatever\n                  happens happens so we are not paranoid i am not\n                  afraid at the moment and you know i am a rebel at heart so that was easy from the beginning and then you know obviously\n                  bill was not afraid so it is kind of weird that we do what we do but we\n                  do not see it as something that would cause fear it is\n                  more a wild exciting adventure i guess if you will what i am not good at is you know a sort of a more\n                  drone-like existence in which you would have the\n                  same thing every day and you would be predictable in certain\n                  ways so i think that is in our favor and kerry\u2019s not afraid of majestic the nsa the cia the dia the dod or the illuminati but she is\n                  not good with the big spiders right it is very funny on a more serious note i am\n                  not afraid because i know i am an immortal being they\n                  cannot kill me they cannot kill you they cannot\n                  kill any of us that is another lie that we have been told ever since\n                  we were old enough to understand what our teachers were telling\n                  us we are not animated hunks of meat we are immortal\n                  spiritual beings that happen to be driving these vehicles as george loves to say that is very true and i like to say what obi wan kenobi said in star wars maybe you are familiar with this it is a wonderful\n                  movie all that myth all that fact based in myth \u2013 if\n                  they kill me i will just be more powerful than they could\n                  have ever imagined maybe that is why they leave me alone i mean if they\n                  kill me i will just come back that is\n                  where we were right jake is a remarkable man and the spirit\n                  of fun i think which is another thing that kerry and i very\n                  much have in common he has the same thing in common and also like george jake would be talking about all kinds\n                  of things that would make our eyes bulge and he would just\n                  have a big grin on his face because he is been living\n                  with this stuff for a long time voice like what like what here we go i will try\n                  to remember the stories that he told us there is four\n                  days worth and it is not necessarily a linear story first of all he referenced just in passing some of the information\n                  we have on our site about the creation of the super-soldier\n                  program as described by duncan o\u2019finioan and david corso and a whole lot of other people who contacted us privately\n                  who were involved in that the powers that be  the intelligence and militaries of\n                  the world  are very very interested in harnessing the abilities\n                  of humans and they do this is in a number of different ways one of the things that they did with jake interestingly enough is they figured for whatever reason that it would be useful\n                  for them to enhance his cognitive ability so they enhanced\n                  his cognitive ability and this guy can do\n                  all kinds of things he has a reading and comprehension speed of 80,000 to 100,000\n                  words per minute that is a lot of zeroes ok as a test when he went through this program to check out that\n                  particular training he was given george orwell\u2019s animal\n                  farm and he was asked to read it from cover to cover in\n                  three minutes and then he was tested and he was tested like what does it say on the top left\n                    of page 154 you know he got 90 that was not\n                    the highest score but that was enough for him to be a pass i guess that is why he was not in the fbi he was not\n                    a 60-percenter right ok.that was one of the first things that caught my attention\n                  and we actually saw some of this remarkable ability in action\n                  when we were with him we actually witnessed this it was really\n                  very interesting.one of the things that would happen when we were talking with\n                  him is that he would be well for instance when i asked\n                  him a question and he dodged the question he had sort\n                  of skip away from it make a little joke and change the subject and then ten minutes later he had answer it after a little while we saw this as a pattern and we said well why are you waiting for a little while before you answer\n                    this question why are you waiting sometimes for ten minutes sometimes for half an hour sometimes till the next day and sometimes you can answer immediately what is going\n                    on here and he eventually helped us understand that what was going\n                  on was this \u2013 and this is really really interesting and it is just the tip of the iceberg of a whole bunch\n                  of incredible information that he told us he said there is an artificial intelligence system that\n                  operates in hyperspace that is how they keep track of what\n                  people are saying  if they want to \u2013 what people are\n                  saying what they are thinking not only that he said that if they wanted to find out what\n                  julius caesar\u2019s last words really were they could find\n                  out he said this is an enhancement it is a human enhancement\n                  of alien technology he said this is so advanced that the ets\n                  are not happy that we have got it because we are not\n                  using it right that is what he said and he said this\n                  monitoring capacity and this dovetailed directly with something that we had\n                  heard from henry deacon because i talked to henry about a\n                  conversation that i had had completely separately and\n                  this is a whole different story long ago this is another\n                  kind of similar thing there is a lot of interesting whistleblowers\n                  that i have known personally back in 2000 long before camelot i ended up talking\n                  to a guy who used to work in bell labs we were walking on\n                  the beach and this guy was telling me an incredible story at the time i thought it was incredible getting on with the story we are walking on the beach\n                  because he had not wanted to talk to me about this it\n                  in his own house i told henry this story he said it will not make\n                    any difference where you talk it does not matter whether\n                    you are on the beach in the forest in your bedroom or inside a lead-lined cave he said it makes absolutely\n                    no difference if they want to hear what you are saying they are gonna hear what you are saying you\n                    know?now henry did not enlarge on that but when jake started\n                  to tell us about this technology then i started to understand\n                  it works in hyperspace it is a hyper-dimensional thing and i cannot even imagine the details but when we started to ask jake we said look this is\n                    incredible stuff i cannot believe that these people\n                    have this sort of technology i can believe they have\n                    got advanced craft and i know they can do strange things but this is really out of this world he said listen black technology  meaning black\n                  physics technology or the physics that they use in black ops\n                   is probably something like 10,000 years ahead of public\n                  sector technology \u201310,000 years ahead of public\n                  sector technology and it is accelerating away\n                  from the state of public sector technology at a rate of a thousand\n                  years a year that is how come they can do this stuff he said you have no idea what they can do they can do\n                    almost anything and this is the remark that brian was saying yesterday about\n                  arthur c clarke\u2019s comment any sufficiently high\n                  technology would be actually indistinguishable from magic we are\n                  almost at that stage already as far as we can understand from\n                  what jake was saying yeah just to sort of drill down a little bit into\n                  what was going on when he would answer the questions or not\n                  answer the questions one of the things he would do is say wait we had say wait wait for what then\n                  he would say ok it is all right now it is important to know that he was a trained remote\n                  viewer as well and a highly-developed intuitive that helped\n                  him in his various jobs that he did around the world  for\n                  the secret government in essence what he would say is it is coming around again and\n                  it is almost like i guess a traveling beacon which it would zone in or it would be gone he could tap into when\n                  he felt they were sort of listening in and when they were not and that is when he would tell us stuff so that is\n                  how the conversation progressed.i am not sure well ok let me say that one thing\n                  that has been left off of our discussion with him - he talked\n                  also about as you may know john lear had talked about under area 51 and under nevada there is very likely a\n                  high-speed train that goes underground between here and places\n                  like pine gap australia and various other bases including i am sure cern in geneva basically that is how they move people around and he\n                  actually you know attested to that as well as the fact that\n                  john lear had said that he had gotten inside information\n                  about this so this is where again we are getting more than one\n                  whistleblower from completely different places that are in\n                  agreement i want to say here also that there is an interesting\n                  thing that goes on with whistleblowers they are human\n                  like anyone and they often fluctuate as to how much they will\n                  reveal to you at any given time so there is a whole psychology that we have had to\n                  sort of learn by experience as we have started to interact\n                  with these people in dealing with some days they will be able\n                  to tell you things and they will feel brave and sort of rebellious\n                  and tell you whatever they want and the next day they are telling you that they actually\n                  cannot tell you anything they cannot talk about\n                  this they cannot talk about that and they are worried\n                  about the safety of their family and loved ones so it is\n                  important to know that they blow hot and cold in the case of henry deacon he is been quite an interesting\n                  witness one of the people we have gotten to know almost\n                  maybe better than anyone in some ways he worked for livermore labs he worked for places on the\n                  planet that are highly sophisticated that have technologies\n                  that are really beyond as bill is talking about he was hands-on\n                  with those technologies he was involved in 9/11 he knows\n                  some of the planning behind it but his level only goes to\n                  a certain point and this is another thing about whistleblowers - and this\n                  is something else that we keep in mind when we analyze the\n                  testimony that we do get - which is they all have levels at\n                  which they have access and their level cuts off at some point so you cannot always know what they are telling you is\n                  the complete truth based on as richard hoagland would say there are many levels to the onion or the lie is different at every level yeah the lie is different at every level and that\n                  really is absolutely true so that you will get people who\n                  say wait a minute there is no such thing as majestic\n                  12 because i did not know about them and in this\n                  case that is what henry says he is never heard\n                  of majestic 12.voice what is it ok majestic 12 is the storyline goes that back\n                  in the truman administration a group of well basically illuminati were given the task  scientists engineers mainly in america\n                  put together supposedly twelve there are photographs of who\n                  the exact people were people like wernher von braun i am not sure he was in majestic 12.bo\u2019l he was not ok i am not gonna argue with that there are\n                  various people like even ok in theory someone like einstein\n                  could be majestic 12 there were people in high places in government in military that were assembled to handle what was considered\n                  to be \u201cthe et problem or question and from there on they grew and basically stopped letting\n                  presidents know in america except as a need-to-know whatever\n                  they needed to know and then the presidents really did not\n                  have access this dovetails with the testimony of dan sherman who is an\n                  intuitive communicator that was trained by the government who was actually genetically engineered in his mother\u2019s\n                  womb before he was born to handle what will be - according\n                  to what he was taught by the government - a shutdown electromagnetically across the planet at some point in the future and he was not\n                  told when he is still alive we have an interview with him he is\n                  written a book called above black a fascinating man very buttoned-down does not want to reveal a lot but\n                  he did quit the program and then he began to be a whistleblower\n                  to tell people what was going on he was communicating with an alien using a computer initially eventually not using the computer anymore - he had direct communication\n                  with that alien he was trained to handle a situation in which our government\n                  would not be able to communicate with each other  the powers\n                  that be  and they were gonna use humans stationed around\n                  the globe to communicate for some reason with off-planet\n                  intelligences during a time when there would be no electromagnetic\n                  communication the exact phrase in his book above black is that this is in preparation for a future time when\n                  all electronic communication would be rendered useless and\n                  he was told this 20 years ago but as kerry says he was not\n                  told when.and the reason why we went onto that little interesting detour\n                  is because this is further corroboration that the powers that\n                  be somehow knew or suspected or were trying to insure themselves\n                  against something that was coming down the line which they\n                  definitely did not want us to know about because they\n                  felt that we could not handle it.now going back into the jake simpson situation let me just\n                  take two minutes to talk to alfonso the assistant cameraman\n                  at the event] [to alfonso we have got four minutes\n                  worth of tape left we will have to pause just for a couple\n                  of seconds to change tapes and things and that is going\n                  to be coming up very soon when we came across jake\u2019s information in this - and\n                  we have only just started to hear it - because he started\n                  talking about what was known and what might be coming and\n                  what he was in the know about and what preparations had been\n                  made for it.and he was telling this in such detail that we ourselves thought back in october we thought you know what we do not\n                  know if we can release this because we started to wonder\n                  if we had a responsibility to withhold this information because\n                  it did not sound good a few months later we are kind of thinking well ok we know a little bit more we have had a lot of telephone\n                    conversations with the guy he is emphasizing that it\n                    is not known what is going to happen but what he basically said is that it has been known since\n                  the second world war  probably since the second\n                  world war he said  and he suspects this is the reason\n                  for eisenhower\u2019s heart attack in 1955 shortly after\n                  his own meeting with the aliens who were telling him something\n                  that might not all have been good news  that there was something\n                  coming at us or relativistically speaking we are like a ship in the solar\n                  system sailing into the storm as we go careering around the\n                  milky way goodness knows at what rate of speed but we are\n                  sailing into something now this dovetails exactly again with what dan burisch\n                  reports is being told to us by the future humans  that we are\n                  going to be entering an area of energetic space that the effect\n                  on the earth is magnified by the man-made looking glasses and\n                  stargates jake did not know about the man-made looking glasses\n                  and stargates but he said his metaphor was and the words\n                  that he used were there is a \u2018wave coming there is a \u2018wave coming.in space it does not\n                  matter whether you are coming at the wave or the wave\u2019s\n                  coming at you i do not know which one either but he\n                  said there is a wave that is gonna hit us when we said when he said as far as he understands it is not 2012 it is later when we put to him the date that bob dean mentioned to us \u2013 now this is in connection with what he was told was nibiru or planet\n                  x bob dean gave the date of 2017 our man jake simpson said that is\n                  probably just about right that is good news because maybe we have got a few\n                  more years dan burisch never said 2012 dan burisch would\n                  only say round about now.and jake told us interruption discussion re changing\n                  camera tape] we will just pause at that dramatic point and then we will carry on talking about what he so just to reiterate that for those of you that\n                  are in conversation and moving around we are gonna take\n                  a half hour we have one hour left for camelot and\n                  a half hour of that we are gonna dedicate to questions\n                  from the audience we are gonna also allow for around\n                  15 minutes for miriam to speak and she is gonna join a\n                  panel at the very end we have 15 minutes left to just wrap up what we have been\n                  telling you so that to continue on a little bit more with\n                  jake simpson and then wrap things up as closely as we can so we are gonna talk about the superluminal craft that\n                  jake simpson told us about and one thing i want to say  that i was talking to somebody actually alfonso and realized that we had not said \n                  jake simpson is still working for the man \u00a0 the illuminati he was actually in a meeting a secret meeting he told us\n                  about in which i guess it had to do with his rebellion\n                  and breaking from trying to get out of that whole business when he heard them referring to people as you know completely\n                  eliminated what was his actual words do you remember i actually do not remember yeah it was something so dire something so cold\n                  and just ruthless that he realized he had to get out so they\n                  made his life very uncomfortable and closed down some projects\n                  that he had been involved in he got out of the situation but he is called upon from time\n                  to time to do them a \u201cfavor so i have to say\n                  that like many whistleblowers he could never completely get\n                  out and they are often highly surveilled as we are i have to say that although we have had nothing super-bad\n                  happen to us directly there have been people that have had\n                  things happen as a result of association with us such that you know we had somebody who took over our website whose place\n                  was broken into the next day he basically called us up and said he never wanted to have\n                  anything else to do with us now we do not know\n                  for sure that that was just not a coincidence obviously he\n                  felt it was a targeted situation so i have to say that whereas we are protected and jake\n                  himself got us into thailand and he has been monitoring our\n                  steps he is quite open about that he in fact will\n                  know exactly what we are doing today he is basically\n                  giving us his blessing he is also made it possible for us to get through some\n                  immigration problems that we could have had so we have\n                  also had assistance in those areas but people that associate\n                  with us it may be another matter we just do not know ok back to jake one of the things that he told\n                  us  and this will be fun for the aerospace buffs in the crowd\n                  here  he told us about the tr-3b the big triangle.he said that this thing can travel from geostationary orbit which is 22,300 miles up to treetop height in one two three four five  seconds and\n                  i said wow that is something else and i said jake how do you know that he said i was counting ok i later figured\n                  it out that is 16 million miles per hour he said look this does not travel in space this\n                    does not travel in space this is a space-time jump\n                    operation that kind of thing and he cannot say\n                    any more.these things can travel outside of our solar system if they\n                  want to or even larger versions can this\n                  is all part of the 10,000 years ahead of regular physics context\n                  that he told us about and that is just a fun story for\n                  the aerospace buffs of which i am one.but what he told us about the \u2018wave that was\n                  coming which is where we were at just before the break one\n                  of the things i asked him was well how did he know about\n                  this thing this can be answered on a number of different levels one\n                  of his responses to that was they have been out to take\n                  a look they have been out \u201cin their superluminal\n                  craft they have been out to take a look at\n                  this thing and they have come back to report what it was\n                  that they measured whatever they saw that impressed me it was a very straight-forward matter-of-fact\n                  answer it is actually well yeah you know if you are\n                  sitting in florida and there is a storm coming in there is\n                  a hurricane coming in then maybe you go out and take a look\n                  and see where it is and you come back and say you know\n                  what it is going to be here in three days now he did not know  this is to repeat what we said before\n                   he did not know when this thing was coming and he\n                  did not know what would happen when it did come it is very very important to stress that he said that\n                  nobody knows what is going to happen the ets do not\n                  know he said it could be just a puff of wind and then it is\n                  all over you know or he said it could be he is the\n                  only other person that we have come across who said exactly\n                  what george green said about the 400-mile-an-hour winds he\n                  said exactly the same thing he said that this is the kind of thing that could occur whether it will occur or not is a completely different\n                  matter and what jake was saying was being done about this was something\n                  that was not news to us or would be news to anyone in this\n                  room he said that ever since they found out about this stuff which\n                  is pretty much \u2019round about the second world war the\n                  military have been doing what it is that they do best which\n                  is they are digging and start being defensive so they\n                  started tunneling in and making all their trillions of dollars-worth\n                  of investment in our underground bases one of the things he told us was that in some locations when\n                  they were excavating these giant bases that they have got they broke into older bases that were there deep underground which have not been built by us.voice whoo hoo oh yeah what he said was - and we had not heard\n                  this anywhere before - he said that these bases were thousands\n                  of years old and had evidently been excavated by our predecessors\n                  in their response to the similar situation that occurred in\n                  their world 12,000 years ago ok?now you correlate that with all the myths of the great flood\n                  that exist in 88 different cultures or however many it is now and plato\u2019s report of the sinking of atlantis  and\n                  he was a good historian he never got anything wrong something happened back then there is a huge amount\n                  of circumstantial evidence and some would say quite solid\n                  evidence to suggest that a long time ago we had before our current civilization there is a prior civilization\n                  that had its own high technology that might have been based\n                  on slightly different stuff than we have got here but\n                  they were faced with exactly the same problems because these\n                  problems are cyclical and the cyclical problems are connected with the solar system\u2019s\n                  rollercoaster journey around the milky way as it goes up and\n                  down like horses on a merry-go-round going round and round and round and round and up and down and up and down every time it crosses the galactic plane there seems to be\n                  some problematic thing that happens that is connected with\n                  energetic space this does also link in with what other commentators particularly\n                  david wilcock and others  david is a good friend of ours we know him very well  have commented about the fact that\n                  this is not necessarily always bad news this energetic space that we travel through regularly is also\n                  maybe something that prompts changes in our dna changes in\n                  the way that our consciousness functions changes in the way\n                  that we are able to access and process information personally i would not take it any further than that but i do personally believe that there is some evidence to\n                  suggest quite some circumstantial evidence to suggest that\n                  not only are there earth changes but there are consciousness\n                  changes and all of this stuff is happening at the same time one of the things that henry deacon told us when we first\n                  met him back in september 2006 he said the problem is that\n                  everything is happening at the same time it is all converging it is all coming together he did not say what \u201ceverything was but he was emphasizing over and over again that the problems\n                  are multiple and this is one of the reasons why they are\n                  so confusing yeah and i wanted to say that henry deacon from\n                  the early time we met him he has been absolutely adamant in\n                  terms of what he was told by the government while he was working\n                  for black projects how they were informed that these things\n                  were coming  and therefore on the more negative side of the\n                  timeline  and that they needed to be prepared for so one of the things that henry has been doing has been telling\n                  us about things like buying a car that is old enough not to\n                  be containing an engine management system so that the powers that be cannot drive your\n                  car for you and also so that it cannot be affected by the cmes\n                   that come off the sun when the sun\n                  starts to get very active which he said was going to be inevitable he basically is operating  and many people from black projects\n                   it is almost like if you will a form of programming i have to say in which they are told there is a roll-out it is basically the agenda as george green has laid it\n                  out to you and that is why you get so many of the same\n                  reports now a lot of the agenda items have not actually happened\n                  yet but as you see the ball is starting to roll certainly\n                  the economy going down is maybe the tipping point so he has been cautioning us for two years to find a safe\n                  place to do this to do that and make all these preparations\n                  for what he feels he is completely convinced is coming\n                  and that is absolutely inevitable interestingly enough we put him in touch with david wilcock some of you will be familiar with david - maybe a reincarnation\n                  of edgar cayce depending on your point of view david is very\n                  optimistic david believes in ascension david believes that\n                  consciousness is changing that there is something very\n                  positive coming out of all this henry and david had a wonderful meeting of the minds they have\n                  talked for hours and hours and hours david was just on coast\n                  to coast reporting on a lot of our henry deacon testimony things that henry has told him about you know human-looking\n                  aliens that are working in the government we have also gotten that same testimony from bob dean\n                  who is an elder statesman and ex-military man who is definitely\n                  in the know as to what is going on behind the scenes with\n                  the government so what is very interesting is to see a black project\n                  person like our henry deacon get in touch with someone like\n                  david wilcock and also resonate with some of the things that\n                  david is saying in terms of look it is not all dire so\n                  that is an interesting sort of side-light to what goes\n                  on what we do try to do is put some of our whistleblowers in\n                  touch with our other contacts often they strike up wonderful\n                  friendships and there are meetings of the minds and sometimes\n                  they can put two and two together also among themselves we also put george in touch with jake simpson for example so they have had some dialogue jake for example resonates\n                  very strongly with everything george is saying and wants to\n                  sort of go further along that line with george because george\n                  is very instrumental in sort of making plans for what\n                  can we do if all of this is coming what can we do that is actually the next step that we want to talk about\n                  before we open up for questions we created another website\n                  - it is called projectavalon.net -\n                  a few months ago it has a forum in which what our objective\n                  was once we stated the problem with camelot and\n                  described the problem what we wanted to do was create solutions\n                  or possible solutions and connect people so that they could\n                  find safe places if they felt that was necessary so again project avalon is set up to do that and\n                  i mentioned it before do you want to talk about\n                  it in general in any way yeah it was inspired really by our interview\n                  with george green in that we i think it was dated last april we were so struck by his ground crew messages [ed note george\u2019s\n                  channeled book messages for the ground crew] and\n                  it resonated with us so strongly.the message of  i am just trying to think how to put\n                  it all into just a single sentence \u2013 it is a message\n                  of hope against a backdrop of bad news if you like in other words we can do something about it but we have\n                  to start now and we have to connect with people we have to\n                  work together we have to form communities we have to be smart we have to be informed and then we are into the chance you know now to me that sounds like the kind of a thing that a coach\n                  would say before an important game that is the kind of\n                  thing that gets me motivated to play my best other people might say hey i quit but some people\n                  are going to quit and some people are going to step up to\n                  the plate and produce their very very best at this time one of my favorite movies some of you may know this it is\n                  dated now actually this is with jeff bridges called starman anyone\n                  seen starman hey wow ok i love that movie one of the things he says at the very very end and the\n                  story of starman:it is a bit about an alien who\n                  has taken on a human body and he is on the run from the\n                  spooks that are trying to grab him and so on and so forth he is saying towards the end of the movie what he has\n                  learned from his short time operating as a human being on this\n                  planet and his summary as he says the thing that is\n                  really wonderful about you is that when things are at their\n                  worst you are at your best such a moving line that had\n                  a huge impact on me because it is so true we have that capacity to step up to the plate to give the\n                  american baseball term here i am english you know and\n                  i prefer cricket but it is got something to\n                  do with rising to the occasion it is got something to\n                  do with responding to the challenge and we can do this talk about avalon no no no you want me to talk about it ok fine yeah a little bit yeah and then we will open\n                  up for questions yeah it is about connecting with people it is\n                  about synergy it is about the fact that individually\n                  we may fall but together we may stand you know and there\n                  are groups that are forming all over the world we called this\n                  what george is calling it in his wonderful little book where\n                  is it we do not have it no messages for the ground crew you are the\n                  ground crew we are the ground crew anyone else who is\n                  paying attention to what is going on here are the ground\n                  crew the message essentially is that the ground crew need to work\n                  together and they need to connect together they need to form\n                  communities now a community is not necessarily just a little group\n                  of people at the end of a muddy road halfway up a mountain\n                  in vilcabamba growing their own vegetables and hoping for the\n                  best that is not necessarily what a community is that was a little flip and i did not mean it that way but the community can also be a street it can be the people\n                  in your apartment it can be people who are connected with\n                  each other who meet regularly who live in the city you do not\n                  have to relocate to vilcabamba in order to operate somebody are they in this room the person who said to\n                  me that they had been really worried about this about where\n                  to go and what to do and what action to take and what country\n                  should they be in what community should they join on the avalon forum when this was being debated one of the messages that they got that changed their whole\n                  outlook was it is not where you are it is what\n                  you are ok that person who reported that wonderful story\n                  to me yeah beautiful did i tell that right voice that is it that is it ok and there are other versions\n                  of that it is not necessarily a question of how many\n                  gold coins you have got in your pocket and whether you\n                  know how to grow vegetables it is not about that it is about your relationships with people it is\n                  about whether you can make things work whether you can form\n                  teams with people whether your response to the crisis is oh\n                  my god what am i going to do for myself or oh my\n                  god what am i going to do about everyone else one of the stories which i love which is inspiring i believe\n                  this is told in a wonderful book that inspired me a long time\n                  ago called a holographic universe by michael talbot who have\n                  read that a lot of you i am sure do you remember the story that he told about the researches\n                  being done into the miracles that had taken place at lourdes because some people do receive miraculous curing at lourdes a bunch of psychologists started to interview people who had\n                  received these healings and some people who had not because it was useful to know how come it worked sometimes\n                  and how come it does not work other times what they found out was that the people who had received healings\n                  were the people who had prayed for the healing for somebody\n                  else voice wow is not that a wonderful story?voices uh huh yes and the lovely catch-22 about that is you cannot\n                  fake that you see groucho marx once said honesty and\n                  integrity make the world go round if you can fake that you have\n                  got it made you cannot fake a prayer that someone else will get healed hoping that you are going to get the benefit it does not\n                  work that way it is got to be real you see it is that lifting of ourselves up to be the highest\n                  and the best that we can be so that we are not going into\n                  this situation thinking how can i save my own situation you are going in there saying what can i do that is\n                    best for the human race what can i do that is best\n                    for everyone around me and if we do that if all of us do that if enough of us do\n                  that around the world at the same time this is what is\n                  going to save the situation in my own estimation it is\n                  not a matter of sitting in power spots and meditating and doing you know it is not a question of ritual activity it is the\n                  question of intentional action that is coming from the\n                  very highest place from inside you and for those of you who are saying asking yourself and asking\n                  other people what can i do what can i do do what\n                  we did a long time ago in our naivety in our ignorance \n                  we just started something not knowing where it was going to\n                  go but we just started by taking that first step we did not know where it was going to go but you do\n                  what you can do by taking that first step whatever you can\n                  do do it it does not really matter talk to someone in the bus talk to someone in the plane start writing letters to people open up a website start contributing\n                  to the avalon forum do whatever you can do you know\n                  what you can do we do not and so it is intentional action coming from the highest\n                  place of contribution that is what is going to get\n                  us out of this mess timelines can be changed it is not fixed it is\n                  not determined no one knows what is going to happen \n                  and this is good news that no one knows what is going\n                  to happen click\n                  here for\n                  the\n                  original\n                  video \u00a0\n\n\n\nbill\nryan (br are we live translat\n yeah ladies and gentlemen my friend colleague and fellow retired\nmountaineer brian o\u2019leary brian\no\u2019leary (bo\u2019l well thank you sometimes i do not\neven know what to say i am just overwhelmed with good feelings\nabout all of you even those of you that are sometimes angry laughter\nand applause] because as you know anger is a very important\npart of the process of transformation some\nof you may know about the work of elisabeth k\u00fcbler-ross  about\nthe phases of grief  because you see we are grieving an old\nparadigm we all know that we are messing up the planet and we\nneed all the help we can get whether it is through our et\nvisitors or ourselves elisabeth\nk\u00fcbler-ross did the very important work that we must go through the experiences of the emotions of grief the\nfirst stage is almost always denial and most of humanity is in\ndenial our beautiful precious planet and all of nature is in danger\nand it is with that kind of motivation that i approach what i\nwill be sharing today the\nsecond phase and it is not necessarily a linear progression is\nanger we heard that last night and that is perfectly okay that is much better than murdering and torturing people it is\na healthy expression that we know that something is wrong or at\nleast there is something that is happening something that is\nchanging it is not necessarily wrong but we are in the midst\nof a big change it is\nwith great mixed feelings that i come from america when i was a\nlittle boy and i was told by my parents that we won world war two \nthat was a good feeling i did not of course know all the\ndetails but i was raised with a feeling that we could do anything now when i was eight years old i wanted to go to the moon i would read\nthe writings of wernher von braun and arthur c clarke and everybody\nthought i was crazy when i was a senior in high school i was asked\nto write an essay on an important topic i wrote it on space\nsatellites the history teacher handed the paper back to me and said well-researched but not\nrelevant the\nfollowing fall sputnik went up and twelve short years later man\nallegedly\nlanded on the moon i\nuse the word allegedly because i do not know personally whether the moon landings\nwere a hoax or real how am i to tell if i did not go there and then this raises the nagging question of epistemology how do we\nknow what we know well when i was in school i became an eagle scout i climbed the\nmatterhorn in 1962 and i was appointed as an astronaut to go to\nmars in 1967 so you could see i was raised with the point of view\nthat we could do anything but a few things happened on the way to the vision one was the war in\nvietnam that was in 1968 when i was told by the president of the\nunited states then lyndon b johnson that we would scrub the later\napollo flights and the mars mission needless\nto say i was very disappointed so i went to cornell university to\nteach astronomy alongside carl sagan and i became a peace activist and i have been ever since it\nwas interesting last night that there was this feeling of anger that\ncontinued when we went to the chinese restaurant to have roast duck and a very angry man came up to our table and said you\namericans oh obama\nis bad schlesht ed note we do not know if this word is a made-up word\nor an actual foreign word so you see the tradition of anger continued and the last thing i want\nto do is support any kind of effort towards war and torture so what i thought i had do to center myself and all of us i am\ngoing to play the piano for about five minutes it helps\ncenter me and then we will kind of invoke positive energy here so that we can go on with the talk thank you brian\nplays piano for several minutes bo\u2019l thank you it was interesting that bill introduced me last night as\nbeing the oldest\nperson on the panel and i sometimes wonder what happened to all those\nyears all i know is that i am acting as if this last trip is\nour last and there is a big job to do if it is but i do not think it is  because the world situation let us face it  it is very very difficult it is\neasy to get angry it is easy to place blame on those that are\nsuppressing things and i being a peace activist \u2013 and peace\nactivists act in different ways \u2013 i visualize a big field of\nlove enveloping everything and that is where the negativity\ndissolves there is\na piece of the whole transformational picture which i have taken\nit upon myself to have a good look at that is what\nshould we do about the energy crisis i am\nsure most of you are aware of how deep the environmental problems of\nthe earth are in 1975 i was an advisor \u2013 energy advisor \u2013\nto the u.s congress and i worked with congressman morris udall who\nwas running for president on an environmental platform in the\neffort i was able to learn about what many of the options were for\nour energy future but at that time i was very much in the mainstream so the notion of\nfree energy or zero-point energy or various advanced hydrogen and\nwater chemistries and cold fusion did not occur to me so i\nbecame a solar/wind advocate and it is still something that\ncould conceivably solve our problems but all of this was part of a track that i was taking in my life was to\nenvision what realistically we could do as humans to create a\nsustainable future for humankind in\nthe process i also went through a period of intense metaphysical\nexploration that began to happen in 1979 when i was on the physics\nfaculty at princeton university i started to have remote viewing\nexperiences i had a near-death experience and i had various healing\nexperiences at\nthat point i began to realize that science western science was\nvery limited and because the other physicists at princeton my\ncolleagues six of whom were nobel laureates\n\u2013 there were 40 of us and we were all men \u2013 did not\nbelieve anything in the paranormal was real so i felt very lonely and felt compelled to leave princeton and it was\nat that time my career became endangered at this point having now been in this outside-the-box\nmode for 30 years i am feeling more comfortable with it now it was hard financially for me to get my children through college but i really have enjoyed these 30 years because not only was i\nable to explore many metaphysical concepts and have spiritual growth\nas well but i was able to check in with new scientists and observe\ntheir experiments all over the world about the realities of\nparanormal phenomena so if it is the healing or whether it is remote viewing or\nmorphogenetic fields or ufo/et phenomena the power of positive\nintention the power of meditators being able to change the\nproperties of water or free energy every time i began to discover\nfor myself the value the importance of these new sciences and the really good news about this is that the epistemology of this new\nscience is exactly the same as that of mainstream science so you\ncan have it all ways what\ni had like to do today is focus on one aspect of new science and\nthat is the promise of clean cheap decentralized energy so now i am going to sit down and take you on a little slideshow the energy solution\nrevolution which is also\nthe title of my latest book what\ni am looking at now because i think this is where the real\nanswers lie having visited the laboratories of several dozen\nso-called free energy\ninventors i have\nabsolutely no doubt the technologies are very real the\nconcepts have already been proven the wright brothers have already\nflown their first airplane but we have not put it to practical\nuse yet so the real action in this issue is not technical it is social\nand political it is\nvery clear that these concepts have great promise for a sustainable\nfuture for the earth but the technologies have been suppressed especially when they get to the point of being available to the\npublic and i began to learn how difficult it really is to get to the\npoint of implementing technologies such as this because it threatens\nvested interests so very appropriately here and i think maybe if we turn the lights\ndown a little i\nlove this quote from george orwell the author of 1984 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a\nrevolutionary act and we\nare certainly in one of those times the\ngreat late science fiction writer isaac asimov said when\nstupidity is considered patriotism it is unsafe to be intelligent i am\ngoing to talk a little bit about an example of the great threat to\nour precious planet earth meredith\nand i live in ecuador we live in a beautiful spot that is in the\nandes which reminds me very much of the alps without the snow just\nto the east of us is the amazon basin it is the world\u2019s\nlargest intact rainforest consisting of an area  of most\nof western europe and there are many indigenous peoples who are\nvoluntarily isolated it is the rainforest with the greatest\nbiodiversity on earth and absorbs more carbon dioxide than just about\nany other area of the earth what\nyou see here on this map on the upper left side is the country of\necuador it is this area right here so this is ecuador and we live right here and the amazon is all in\nhere this is peru here brazil bolivia colombia and the yellow\nareas are all areas in which oil-drilling leases have been issued there is\nabout a trillion swiss francs-worth of oil under the ground in these\nareas and the governments generally would like the oil companies\nto come in and drill because of their huge indebtedness to banking\ninstitutions in the first world so about one month ago the indigenous peoples of peru occupied a bridge\nto prevent the oil companies from coming into the rainforest the\npresident of peru ordered helicopters with machine guns to murder\nthem this\nis an example of the kinds of things that are happening right now this is the kind of news that is hard to get on cnn you have a\nlittle better opportunity here but\nthis is an example of just the kind of thing you\nknow i often reflect about the green\nmovement and the green\nmovement is moving too slowly so this is a quote from a writer from\nsan francisco the san\nfrancisco chronicle this\nis mark morford and he says much\nas i love the green movement in the face of countless billions to be\nmade by raping the planet for oil they are merely the\nequivalent of trying to water the rainforest with an eye-dropper in\nother words the green movement has not been very effective if we\nreally want a sustainable solution for the earth we are going\nto have to have clean energy we are\nnot going to be able to do it with carbon cap and trading\n\u2013 carbon cap and\ntrading that is a\nscheme to basically charge the polluters more money to it is\na financial solution to a non-financial problem \u2013 or to\nsequester the carbon in caves these are very gross solutions now the president of ecuador who is an interesting guy has\nproposed that maybe ecuador could keep its oil in the ground in its\nmost beautiful biodiverse rainforest national park if the world\ncommunity could match funds with lost revenues with ecuador unfortunately that is 350 million dollars or francs three-hundred-and-fifty-million\ndollars per year to keep the oil in the ground those are the\nrevenues that would be lost audience\nmemb  millions or billions bo\u2019l millions that is still a lot does anybody have $350 million maybe to keep oil in the ground in the amazon because audience\nmembe  [very faint offering suggestions of who may have the\nmoney]\n\n\n\nbo\u2019l the federal reserve yeah aig maybe goldman sachs the lapis pig anyway this is an innovative idea it is a step in the right\ndirection but solutions to the energy crisis do exist but are suppressed by\ngovernments and industry through the profit motive [snorts like the\nlapis pig self interest and \u2013 this is a big word \u2013\nincrementalism meaning a little bit at a time eye-dropper it is\nvery clear that if you were to really look at the data on what is\nhappening \u2013 regardless\nof how you come out on the global warming climate change debate\n\u2013 because even if it is\na whole reenergized new energy solar system concept the loading of\ncarbon dioxide in the earth\u2019s atmosphere through the routine\nburning of hydrocarbons is acidifying the oceans and causing\nenormous amounts of pollution respiratory disease and at least some\ncontribution to global warming and climate change but that is just part of it the amount of water pollution is\nenormous the threats to sustainable agriculture are huge so we\nneed new human systems that are earth-oriented and visionary as\ni pointed out the other night we need to adopt the precautionary\nprinciple which states basically that we cannot go on as we are going on we will\nsomeday reach a tipping point that no amount of chemtrails or other\ngross macro-engineering projects will be able to solve so let us create a much-more sustainable friendly world for\nourselves what\nkind of criteria would we develop for our energy sources they need\nto be clean cheap decentralized and safe as well as publicly\naccountable this\nis a very very tall order no weapons use no secrecy no greed you\nsee we need a whole new social contract and it is going to be\nup to us to create that now most of the energy we now use is unsustainable it is very\nobvious that we are going to wars of conquest for the oil and\nthe pollution and climate change etcetera etcetera among\nthe net energy non-solutions of course are hydrocarbons or fossil\nfuels \u2013 oil coal and natural gas terrible terrible nuclear power is expensive\nand unsafe remember chernobyl and there is no safe disposal of\nthe high-level radioactive waste there is the potential of\nglobal proliferation of the technologies and weapons so some people say well let us have a hydrogen economy hydrogen burns clean but hydrogen costs more to it takes more energy to produce\nthe hydrogen than you get out of the fuel unless you do things to\nthe hydrogen to manipulate its chemical nature and then we have a form of over-unity or free energy biofuels biofuels such as corn  ethanol from corn  do not work it is\nanother way of burning carbon it burns a little bit cleaner but you\nneed a whole big infrastructure to develop it so that is not\ngonna work and it competes with agriculture one\nsports-utility vehicle\u2019s tank-full of biofuel one tank-full\nof the sports-utility vehicle of biofuel could feed one hungry person\nin one year yet in north america and parts of europe there is\na huge amount of corn being grown for ethanol and that is\nburning food solar\nand wind suffer from high cost we are talking somewhere in the\nvicinity of $20 to $40 trillion dollars for a solar or wind economy\nto replace current energy demand it takes great materials and land\nuse and is intermittent and diffuse\n\u2013 meaning that it only\nworks when the wind blows and the sun shines and it is not very\nconcentrated i\nwould love for solar and wind to be the answer but i think we are\nin a new century now and we need to look forward rather than\nbackward so the new energy technologies include the so-called zero-point\nenergy devices yes these are basically electromagnetic devices\nthat through the use of vibrating electrons\n\u2013 either through the\nrotary motion of a wheel with magnets or electromagnets or through\nthe vibrations of electrons within a solid-state device\n\u2013 can tap the enormous\npotential energy field of the vacuum this\nfield is called many different things sometimes it is called\nthe etheric\nfield sometimes the zero-point\nfield sometimes it is called the orgone\nenergy field there\nare many many different words for it and i believe it is the\nsame field that also underlies our consciousness that we can truly\nbe magicians and extract energy and information out of that field\nthrough our conscious intention so someday i see envisioned small solid-state devices that could go\ninto your circuit breaker box or under the hood of your car there is\nalso cold fusion which is also called low-temperature non-radioactive nuclear reactions there is a lot of confusion\nabout cold fusion two\nuniversity of utah chemists stanley pons and martin fleishmann discovered that when you put a palladium cathode into a solution of\nheavy water nuclear reactions would occur on the cathode no\nradioactivity but a great deal of heat resulted in the reactions and\nthe formation of helium from hydrogen since\n1989 there have been many replications of these experiments and yet 20 years later the mainstream media is just beginning to discover\ncold fusion then\nwe also have advanced hydrogen and water technologies these are\nspecial forms of hydrogen and water that can actually produce more\nenergy than goes into the system as measured by traditional means so if we look for the past one hundred years\n\u2013 since the time of\ntesla  there\u2019ve\nbeen hundreds of new energy researchers but they have been\nsuppressed by powerful interests only\nwith modest investments can we make the necessary breakthroughs okay okay now many mainstream scientists including myself\nabout 30 years ago quoted our own bibles that basically said this\nviolates the laws of thermodynamics well the laws of thermodynamics are not laws they are only theories\nthat apply to a certain narrow range of conditions this is one case\nin which mainstream science is corrupted many other examples too another\nmyth of free energy is that it is so advanced  it must be\nfurther off into the future so let us do what is in front\nof us \u2013 windmills and solar collectors and i am not\nsaying windmills and solar collectors are bad by the way i think\nthey will have many practical applications especially at remote\nsites but to make this assumption that it is so advanced would be like to\ndebate whether airships dirigibles or balloons which one to\nchoose after the wright brothers first flew in 1903 the\nfinal myth is that we can trust governments and the marketplace to\nsupport the research and development nothing could be further from\nthe truth so who are the suppressors of new energy it turns out to be just about\nall of us and that is why we do not have it there\nare the scientists and we have already heard this that scientism\n which itself is a religion the religion of science as it is\ncurrently exercised in the western world  totally ignores the\neffects of consciousness healing and other many many other\nnew sciences\nthat are longing\nto be born the\nenvironmentalists are suppressing new energy \u2013 the people that\ncall themselves environmentalists and if you do not believe me try to reach al gore or any of the green party people mainstream\nenvironmentalism is very cautious the\nmost powerful governments and the large corporations are also\nsuppressing free energy because their own vested interests are\nthreatened so they are in denial of it while some of the rest\nof us get angry sort of like the denial and then anger and by the way elisabeth\nk\u00fcbler-ross\u2019s next phase of grieving is usually\nbargaining yeah maybe this part of\nthe government will support the work maybe this corporation over\nhere would want to do it but\nit is like fitting square pegs in round holes and\nwe have the mainstream media oh boy do they ever love to spin\nstories and\nnow 20 years after the cold fusion discovery with hundreds of\nreplications and a worldwide scientific community of cold fusion\nresearchers 60 minutes\non cbs finally ran a segment on cold fusion but they act as if well you know this thing\nis not real but maybe it is after all \u2013\nbecause\nthey\ndiscovered it so so many vested interests are threatened by the possibility\nof an abundant sustainable future with clean breakthrough energy we\nhad a number of meetings among some of the well-known inventors and\nresearchers of new energy in colorado in 1993 and \u201994 there\u2019re some very well-known people in this picture including\nstefan marinov who was the physicist on the physics faculty university of graz in austria he fell\nto his death a few years\nago likely not to be a suicide okay so what we are going to do in the very near future is to break\nfor air because it is my understanding it is rather hot\nin here is not it we are gonna have a five-minute break\nfor air so we can breathe resuming\nafter the break]\n\n\n\nlife may sometimes be full of surprises and we are all creating\nthis experience that we are having right now so ladies and\ngentlemen i would like to introduce to you my friend and colleague henry deacon henry\ndeacon (hd hello i have been waiting many years to say\nsomething three years with what three years with camelot three years waiting for a moment to feel right just a little thing inspired me\n brian said about cold fusion so many people i know do not\nbelieve still do not believe it is real i am\nstill unsure about saying this but once you say it it is over here's\nmy american passport notice its color david\nwilcock (dw it is brown for those of you who cannot see it from the\naudience it is not the normal color okay just to show that my background is\ndifferent it is a government passport for official business it says official\non it and has special government identification inside which he is\nshowed me and i can verify i no longer i have not been employed i have no income other than\ndisability for four five years now since i left everything what\ni had like simply to address the cold fusion i mentioned to brian\nthat when i was at the naval postgraduate school in monterey california it was open to the public i do not think it is now it\nmay not be but this is strongly identifying the location at that\ntime the location of what i am about to talk about in\nthe basement of the physics department building there were some\nexperiments on the casimir\neffect what\nis the casimir effect bo'l it is a special capacitor that produces over-unity energy it is been\nshown time and time again in various physics laboratories and it is\nbeen demonstrated in several laboratories to use the it is to tap the zero-point energy bo'l that is correct and it was not even in a classified room but unless if you\nwalked by and did not know about it you would not know what was going\non because it is in the postgraduate school environment which\ncaters to military and government \u2013 the civilian component of\nthe government of high rank \u2013 who go there for graduate postgraduate-level research so it is just a very small thing but it definitely makes it very solid\nand real and i have identified a location so as of this once it\nhits the internet translat\n excuse me could you say the geographic location again monterey california near carmel california i worked with\ndifferent professors on many different projects including a space\nsatellite that went was launched on the space shuttle mission one\nhundred and something with john glenn his last mission a hundred\nand fifty or something like that i\ndo not want to go anymore because i do not want to take any more time but just that is enough this could go on forever i do\nwant to thank david for sharing the room except i\nwish he did not read my mind all the time well the fact of the matter is that my other witness daniel confirmed that monsanto made a little box about this big and you\ncould run your whole house on it they were used in many many space\nprobes and it has been available since at least the \u201960s to\nhenry] can you confirm that oh yes absolutely and then brian talking about palladium well i actually purchased some palladium a few years ago it has very interesting properties of absorbing hydrogen and being\nable to separate it is a great storage medium for hydrogen\ngas a safe storage medium so maybe it is above value now we\ndo not know where it will head bo\u2019l yeah the point here really is that there are so many\ntechnologies even in the break some people came up to me and said did you know about this\nperson or this person or this person it is\neverywhere and yet it is still been held back so at this\npoint our job is to become more public about it and to demand that\nwe are allowed to develop this in a way that is socially\nresponsible the\nphotographs that i am about to show are of some of the\ninventors some of the many inventors that are very lonely and\nisolated there is this device here there is this device\nthat is official so\nwe are dealing with almost an embarrassment of riches meaning\nthere are so many different devices so many technologies  any one or some of which could do the trick in a\nway it is really remarkable how complete the suppression has\nbeen and yet to my way of thinking it is our next step in our\nquest for a new science and a world of sustainability audience\nmemb  is he putting his life on the line by coming out on this\nstage you bet your ass he is someone last night told me i had gray hair so yes a\nfriend bo\u2019l but it is not white yet it may turn that way pretty quickly now i would like to\nmention something else that is offline\nfor just a minute if it is okay it had to do with something\nlast night but it is positive dr john mack of harvard university who how many people here have\nheard of him okay about half someone explain who he was i cannot exactly do that bo\u2019l i could he was a good friend of mine a close colleague of mine he\nwas a professor of psychiatry at harvard university who did\nextraterrestrial abduction research he was unfortunately killed in\nan automobile accident \u2013\nthis one may have really been\nan accident \u2013\nin london about three or four years ago his\nabduction research is very important because he discovered that the\nmost common denominator of the messages that the ets gave to the\nabductees was to express how perilous our environmental situation is\non the earth and this is directly out of his latest book passport\nto the cosmos and\ni share that concern you can see that meredith and i are both just\ntremendously concerned about the future of our earth and as the\nresult of this research of john mack\u2019s he came to the same conclusion he had a before i go on with that i realize more and more \nespecially since i for some reason started working with david even\nat a distance  once you get locked in and go with the flow of the\nuniverse for lack of a better word something very magical happens everything you are  synchronized in everything happens in\namazing ways and each of us can do no matter who you are can\nchange the whole future of the whole world \u2013 each of you yes you have to be patient sometimes and wait and not push things back\nto dr john mack when i went back to school and went back to graduate school for\nfurther education i was at purdue university and i learned\nsomething new a new technique it was called yang\nchen qi gong the\nfirst day i went it was in the student union and they had an\nadvertisement on the wall it says the\nmeeting is at this night at this time and i would look in the door  many doors where the meetings were for different clubs  and i looked in the door and it was dark like\nnobody there so i tried next week still dark so i just opened the door and\nthere\u2019re some people they are all just sitting on the\nfloor complete silence in the dark and they are all chinese i\nsat down and i understood what was going on after about a week or\nso and i started practicing this method and anyway i will not go into yang\nchen qi gong\nanymore\nat the moment but later i learned that\ndr mack went\nto china not too long before he died to investigate some phenomena\nwith his abductees and in general many of his abductees had been\npracticing this it is a meditation a form of meditation and\ntwo of the people that were advanced there were well known and\ndocumented in the university and now they are all professors in\ndifferent places in the world well especially one named dr fonzu he was in a state of non-eating\nfor many months he did not have to eat anything it is\ncalled bigu what\ni am getting at with john\nmack is that i think i\nsaid his abductees  many of them had been practicing qi gong but i believe it also applies to other forms of meditation and it\nappears that it opens yourself up to contact \u2013 and they can be\ngood or bad contact but i just want to make you aware of that if\nyou practice so when you are practicing you know it is almost like you are\nopening yourself up to that it is like a beacon okay thank you bo\u2019l thank you well we have just had a deacon\nbeacon shedding light on a very important topic and\nagain the point is that the number of devices and inventors are\nscattered all over the world about 10 years ago i made a point of\ntraveling around the world and this \nvisiting some of them so now i am about to show some\nphotographs of these fellows if that is appropriate just before you start that brian i just want to publicly thank\nhenry for his contribution here it is an act of great courage\nand great service and i want to thank you for your friendship your\nsupport and your huge contribution to everything that we are trying\nto do here all of us together in this room this is why i came here and on behalf of project camelot i would love to invite you to the\ncamelot conference in los angeles in september if you had be\nwilling to take the stage and share more of your personal\nperspectives on the new world that we have waiting for us we are\nnot putting you under pressure for any kind of an answer but is this\nsomething you would consider can i come in through the mexican-california border we will smuggle you in do not worry bo\u2019l you have an official passport okay you remember 2001 a\nspace odyssey the\nend of the movie there was a star-child this may have been\nmentioned already a metaphor this\nworld is not ending at all it is just going through birth\npangs birth pains a\nnew child you know that is all could you briefly say something about what the other people [ed note referring to ets] that you have met are like to be around they make you feel very very happy and good  almost all of them when he says people just we are all people\nin this galaxy  maybe a little bit different-looking but it is\nlike different flowers that is all so usually it is a very elating uplifting feeling you may laugh the first time  you will be laughing that is all so if you see something  like in the report\nfrom iron mountain \nmany of the possible things to alternatives to war creating\nfictitious enemies one of the things that was listed in there in the\nearly \u201960s was a threat from outer space you\ncan look at that report it is not fictitious at all president john\nkennedy asked that the rand corporation think-tank about the\ndesirability of ending wars and bringing about peace\n\u2013 what the feasibility\nand possibility would be so\nthe conventional-thinking geniuses came up with alternatives that is\nall alternatives to war they\nthought that if they took all the money that went into war and into\nthe national reconnaissance organizations that they would be able to\nfeed and house everyone on the planet and then what would the people\ndo so we have to have something so we create enemies just like george\norwell we create threats we create environmental menace that was\nmentioned environmental menace this\nwas written this\nreport was put out in\nthe \u201960s you can see  it is all happening bo\u2019l it is very sobering is not it the conventional thinkers\nand the scenarios they come up with which always seem to involve\ncontrol we have to think differently think different apple computer i would like to say while we are on stage that there was one\ntime when i was on the phone with henry no mr neumann the real name mr neumann the real name and he was called by one of these clandestine agencies and he put it\non speaker phone on his cell phone i witnessed the entire\nconversation take place between them for someone to try to tell me\nthat he set this up is pathetic it was completely random after we had\nbeen talking for three hours that is how you run away and it is like the movie the\nprisoner you run away and then they find you and they offer you work and then you run\naway again and they offer you another job i would say that henry or art as his real name is is the\nmost-knowledgeable witness ever to come forward in human history\nabout these projects i again want to personally thank you for\nvolunteering to do this for all of us i do consider you a hero for\ndoing this it is just what i came here for ed\nnote henry deacon is art neumann for the record so\nall references to \u2018henry deacon hd will include art\nneumann hence (hd/an from this point on brian what world would we have if these technologies get freed up what can we visualize for the future bo\u2019l it would be a world of great abundance if it is properly\nmanaged it is a big if and so it is up to us to create social systems to facilitate\nthe ethical use of these technologies they\nare truly breakthrough for example you could have pure water simply\nby desalinating the ocean water but\nthere are many many other things that can happen too you can have\nabundant food because you see energy no longer is a block the\nkind of new world that one visualizes here very quickly becomes a\nvery very good world and part of the good news about this is that\nwe can plan it we can plan this program the whole thing including\nmaking the transition as painless as possible the\nunited states department of energy recently issued a request for\nproposals about new energy technologies i responded to the proposal and i called it impacts of\na breakthrough energy economy in\nthe proposal i proposed a novel idea which is to develop\n\u2013 even if it is\nhypothetical \u2013 a\nquestion what are public\nattitudes toward a world of breakthrough energy let us bring this discussion out to the public let us be\nopen about this so that was part of the proposal the\nother was to get together a number of people like as an advisory\ngroup without vested interests to advise on scenarios of a clean\nbreakthrough energy future so far that has not been done it is\nbeen kept secret and now we have to be willing to be bold enough to\nthink about such a future guess\nhow much money i asked for for the study one dollar the\nreason for that of course is that energy like everything else should be our birthright at the very least a world of breakthrough\nenergy will buy us some time so that we can truly plan a sustainable\nfuture for the earth i had be interested in seeing more of these slides do you have\nother technologies bo\u2019l yes let us look at that but that was great that was great bo\u2019l well let us do it okay because this is provable stuff you are saying these guys have\nhardware and it already works right bo\u2019l oh yeah this is a trip i took about 10 years ago all around the\nworld for example paramahamsa tewari\nhas a magnetic motor which the government of india has given him actually money and laboratory space to develop this he\nstarts it up as a generator then he unplugs it and it is a\nfree-running motor \u2013 or a free-running generator it is\nthe other way round he starts it as a motor and then it becomes a\nfree-running generator suji\ninumata had another\nsuch device in japan some\nof you may have heard of yull\nbrown he developed\nbrown\u2019s gas which is a very special form of water which\npeople are now using to burn cleaner fuels as additives and also to\nactually run cars on water next\none this is a welding device that yull brown developed from brown\u2019s\ngas which is really extraordinary sparky\nsweet \u2013\ni talked about that in the workshop this morning he is a\nretired engineer from general electric and he has in his hand a\nspecially-conditioned magnet which lit up a bank of light bulbs next\nslide please john hutchison canadian inventor who is sort of like\na reincarnated nikola tesla and is able to create anti-gravity this\nwas an aluminium\n\u2013 that is how\ncanadians call aluminum \u2013\nbar and he thrashed it with huge amounts of energy he was able to\ngenerate next\nslide tom bearden \u2013 with a little artistic license here \u2013\ntom is still with us on the earth and he is a brilliant\ntheoretician of free energy how\nmany of you have heard of tom bearden yeah about half of you a\nlittle less he wrote a book called energy\nfrom the vacuum it is\nvery technical but he basically \u2013 his bottom-line message is\nthat the electrical engineers have maxwell\u2019s equations all\nwrong they neglect the most important term in maxwell\u2019s\nequation which is the so-called scalar\nterm which contains basically the information you need to extract\nenergy from the zero-point energy field these\nthings are very hard to explain by the way and you probably want to\nsee a device right on the table now in front of you for that i\napologize what we really need to have is a concerted effort among\nengineers and inventors to bring this to the next level of proof many\npeople think you can just go down to wal-mart and buy your own free\nenergy gizmo but we are not there yet it takes time and money\nand effort to get to the point where we will have the gizmo on\nthe table so at this point the important thing is to visualize that it is\npossible to have this you do not even have to believe\nit just visualize the possibility and then ask the\nquestion why are not\nwe doing it should\nwe not leave no stone unturned in our quest for clean energy it is\na very logical question if we want a sustainable future for planet\nearth next\nslide this is a very sad story eugene mallove was editor of\ninfinite energy\nmagazine he was the chief science writer for mit massachusetts\ninstitute of technology and he was assigned the job of debunking or\nridiculing the original discovery of cold fusion some\nnuclear physicists at mit were not or claimed not to be able to\nreplicate the experiment but these were nuclear physicists who had a\nvery strong vested interest in their own hot fusion tokomak reactors a concept that has so far cost the u.s government and taxpayers\ntens of billions of dollars hd it keeps them employed though bo\u2019l but they knew nothing about electrochemistry which is what this\nconcept is all about so\neugene mallove discovered that the nuclear physicists actually\ncommitted fraud and fudged the data so as to make it look like they\ndid not replicate it which led the late sir arthur c clarke to say this\ncould well be the greatest scandal in scientific history this was in 1989 1990 and\nnow for 20 years hundreds of people have replicated and done\nsuccessful cold fusion experiments and\nthen we will interject something here that david just informed\nme about because you would think that okay\nit works  where is the tabletop device let us make one let just do it it should be easy well it has not been quite as easy as you might expect for at least\ntwo reasons the one reason that i am familiar with is that many of\nthese free energy devices respond to the consciousness of the\nexperimenter this is reminiscent of particle physics experiments in\nwhich the observer changes the properties of the observed so many rigorous scientists have not touched cold fusion because they\nbelieve that because it does not work all\nthe time it does not work any\nof the time and david you have another explanation about why it\nmay work sometimes and not work sometimes i was talking yesterday about how all 4,000 pyramids and ancient\nsites have been built on this geometric grid around the earth these\ngeometric lines represent where the most torsion-field energy comes\nfrom when you have a cold fusion device on or near one of these\nlines it will work very well the\n60 minutes\ndocumentary he spoke of revealed that in some places it does not\nwork at all this is almost certainly because those areas are not on\nthe grid i\nwould also like to say something about dr eugene mallove if you\ndo not mind bo\u2019l go ahead he had a working tabletop device that always worked the only person\nhe told about this was my colleague richard hoagland they were\nabout to go to washington d.c and show it to senators they were\ngoing to announce this on the air with me on a saturday night friday\nafternoon dr eugene mallove was bludgeoned\nto death in his back yard the killing has to stop bo\u2019l i know it really upset me a great deal when it happened because at\nthe time i had founded the new energy movement and he was going to\nbe the keynote speaker and i became the keynote speaker and moved to\necuador not\nout of fear actually because meredith and i enjoy our life there\nvery very much so that was not the only reason but i was\nvery upset for quite a while when that happened and\nanother tragic example is stefan marinov actually he is in\nthat picture too he is the man on the right and up a little\nbit in the gray sweater bo\u2019l okay the one in the middle that is stefan marinov i knew him\nwell he was a physics professor at the university of graz\nin\naustria he was found\njumping \u2013 but\ni think the right story is falling\n\u2013 from the 10th story\nof the library building at the university of graz about four years\nago he\nwas a very jolly person and one eyewitness saw him falling\nbackwards falling backwards as if he were pushed he left no\nsuicide note and he was one of the most positive highly-spirited\npersons i have ever met he was sort of like the head of the\neuropean free energy movement this happened about four years ago hd do not be afraid of dying it is just changing form bo\u2019l that is why the concept of karma is so important hd it all depends on what you want to do here if you can first bo\u2019l by the way the other scientist on the left here randall mills he\nfounded blacklight power which is a very special form of hydrogen in\nwhich he found that energy states of hydrogen can be lower than the\ntraditional ground state hd how low can you get bo\u2019l quite low and you can get about 100 times more energy out of a\nhydrogen plasma tube than you could get with ordinary hydrogen and\nhe is discovered well he is made many discoveries in\nthis and has even developed a theory around it called classical\nquantum mechanics i\nthink that having been in the world of physics myself  it is\nfair to say that physics is in for a big change and unfortunately like the particle collider here in switzerland and many other\nstate-of-the-art\nkinds of directions it is not as fertile direction as free\nenergy and the new science of consciousness and is not it interesting that quantum theory itself predicts and\nshows that consciousness does exist because the act of observation\ncreates the physical reality you observe most physicists ignore that\nfact and go about their materialistic ways hd well at livermore many many many decades ago i found it quite\nnovel that after some research of the top scientists under edward\nteller they were passing around a book to each other called the\ntao of physics inaudible\ncomment from audience]\n\n\nhd the way \u2013\nit was a metaphysical book you know because they realized what was\ngoing on a long time ago at the q-level clearance above top secret bo\u2019l edward teller by the way is the father of the hydrogen bomb basically originated the star wars program for ronald reagan and\nloved to create chemtrails and other things in space to screen out\nsunlight to offset global warning\n\u2013 and does it with\ngreat delight like dr strangelove hd edward would you please explain where you are coming from i\nstill do not understand you bo\u2019l and by the way he is passed over but he was certainly quite\na stereotype of a boss hd his two babies were los\nalamos national labs \u2013\nthat was his big baby \u2013 and\nthen livermore national labs which was livermore labs his second\nbaby but you would not know anything about those hd no and then interesting how they kept changing the name and that  very expensive changing the name of livermore labs it was lawrence livermore labs then they changed it to lawrence\nlivermore national labs \u2013 and at the same time it was the\nunited states atomic energy commission \u2013 and then it was the\nu.s energy research department\n\u2013 erda bo\u2019l oh yes energy research and development administration hd and then it was energy research and development agency so they\nhad to change all the paperwork again then they changed it to the\ndepartment of energy it was all the same thing i do not\nunderstand that bo\u2019l by the way the u.s energy department spends approximately i\nthink it is $30 billion dollars a year maybe it is more\nnow and it is almost all on fossil fuel and nuclear energy\nresearch and nuclear weapons hd in 1976 or so we had a meeting i had to go a big meeting a\nhigh-level conference classified conference in a big auditorium and\nthey put up a graph up here a projection of oil reserves and then they said in 30 years we will be running out of oil and that\nwas top secret i do not understand what is going on it is\nconfusing why was that top secret and is it true we are\nrunning out of oil bo\u2019l yeah the known oil reserves on the earth will give us another 30 to\n100 years depending on how fast we gobble it up there is\na whole movement called the peak oil movement who believes that\nwe are now at the top at peak production of oil and then we\nare going to descend the slippery slope of scarcity hd that is what we were told at the meeting bo\u2019l and that is what you were told at the meeting it is\nobvious it is out there in the public domain i think some of\nthe scarcity is created artificially but regardless of how you\nthink of it the hydrocarbon age that we are now in is a\ndinosaur literally hd oh one simple thing i keep interrupting bo\u2019l go ahead hd i wanted to mention that i was very surprised because you know it is over for me now bye-bye no project\nshiva \u2013 shiva\nnova \u2013 a\nlaser fusion project you can look it up on the internet it is\non bbc lately oh laser\nfusion something new that is\nwhat they finished in the \u201970s most american\nscientists were not even allowed access to that project when\ni went in to the project i was very surprised at the scientists i\nsaw there where they were from red china our technology that\ntechnology american science technology at the highest levels was\nbeing given to the top chinese people in red china  what does that\nmean bo\u2019l okay maybe we should move along here and i will show a few more\nhere because we have been told we are going to have a break at\n4:30 which is 15 minutes from now so like david yesterday i am\ngoing to fast-forward what\ni want to point out is that we have had a few meetings among free\nenergy researchers this is quite a distinguished group with a\nlittle artistic license as well i will\njust mention a few names tom bearden hal puthoff peter graneau\nfrom mit that is peter graneau me meredith and jim carrey what is jim carrey doing in a group of\nfree energy eggheads well he was filming dumb\nand dumber while we were\ntrying to get smart and smarter there\u2019re\nsome other distinguished there\u2019re stefan marinov paramahamsa tewari from india suji inumata and many many other\nrecognizable people unfortunately the software billionaire that funded this effort decided not to fund\nany of our work because we were not\ndipping into the river of optimized profits next\nslide we will go through these rather quickly let us just\ngo on two more a good tom bearden quote but not enough time adam\ntrombly adam is a close colleague of mine and somebody who came up\nwith a free energy device way back about 30 years ago he was told\nby the u.s department of defense to never work on this again and\nhad his device confiscated so he started project earth following\nthe tradition of buckminster fuller i\nthink it is a wonderful quote and i will say it there\nis a limitless and practically-useful energy anywhere you stand or\nsit we can feel it and we can be it we can tap into this with real\ntechnologies we can light our homes and drive our quiet clean\nvehicles as the wounds of our tortured earth are healed forever let us take our planet back let us start now okay now we have to really move fast because my pre-programmed talk is\nbeing truncated here\u2019s\nbuckminster fuller shortly before his death buckminster fuller came\ninto knowledge that free energy existed and he was such a positive\nthinker he was overjoyed he said i am\nglad i have lived long enough to see this it is simply wonderful i\nhope and pray you will live long enough to see the principle upon\nwhich this artifact is based become the new energy source for all\npassengers on spaceship earth next\nslide at montesue\u00f1os our retreat we had what is called\nthe phoenix gathering\nabout a year ago this was a group of visionaries that flew in from\nall over the world and we were given one question to ask ourselves how can we create a\nsustainable future for the earth what\ni discovered during the course of this one-week intensive workshop\nwas that there were different cultures represented who were not\ntalking with one another and so for example the issue of free\nenergy was not considered important because the people came in with\npre-conceived ideas about what kind of future we should have it\nbrings back the famous bertrand russell quote the\nresistance to a new idea increases as the square of its importance so we are talking about supplanting a multi-trillion dollar\nhydrocarbon nuclear energy economy next\nslide this is just photographs of the conference and so we had\nthese different cultures we had the pragmatists lead by a\nprogressive lawyer from new york and because i could not give\nhim a ten-minute explanation for free energy he denied it then the deep ecologists \u2013\nthese are the people that\nreally think the earth is in deep trouble but they also maybe reflect a lot of the green movement in that they are not\nlooking at visionary solutions but going back to the farm then\nthere are the truth-seekers which is represented by a lot of people\nin this room that really want to know what is going on behind\nthe scenes and then the spiritualists\u2014these are people that see the unity in\neverything but the people were not talking with one another and i am\ngoing to suggest that we need some of all of these features to do the\nnecessary synthesis next\nslide arthur c clarke the late arthur c clarke any\nsufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic next\none martin luther king to\nignore evil is to become an accomplice to it and that does not mean that we need to go and blame evil and\nfight them but we should be willing to understand that malevolence\ndoes exist and we need to do something about it next\nslide so this is the conclusion of this talk in my new book embracing the possibility\nof breakthrough energy or what i call an \u201cenergy solution\nrevolution should be our mandate not an idle speculation to\nbe ignored ridiculed or feared next\nslide well i am just going to show about four slides i was\ngoing to do a whole piano/slide gig but i am not going to do\nthat now voi\nboo bo\u2019l because i want to give bill his allotted time but\nthese are photographs basically meredith and i over the past five\nyears have created a beautiful retreat in the andes of ecuador for\nexample last january bill and kerry and george green came and we\nhad two conferences actually one was called \u201ccrisis and\nopportunity the\nother was called the\ncamelot conference appropriately called because i am sure that in coming up with\nthe name project camelot it goes back to the days when there was visionary thinking where\nthere was the good king or the energy of the good king that wanted\nto help humanity even the years of john f kennedy were called \u201cthe\ncamelot years our\ngoal in creating montesue\u00f1os which is really spanish for\n\u201cmountain dreams was to hold these kinds of events to\ncreate a new world if we can take it and\nso in the next three or four slides we will just show you some\narchitectural shots it is one of the most beautiful spots i have\never seen on the planet so we have two main buildings eight\nbedrooms plenty of conference space and we warmly invite you to\ncome to one of our conferences or to just stay and relax with us and\nthis is the new book the\nenergy solution revolution which this talk was all about the\nnext slide is the last slide well that is the next-to-last\nslide i think that is one of the views from\nmontesue\u00f1os and i know bill you had a good time i\nhave to explain this for one minute if i\nmay have one more minute you heard a reference last night to the\nlapis pig here he is the original now he has a swelled head he believes that the bankers have it right and that the military-industrial complex is very good so even\nthough he has been designated guardian of our treasury he has this\nvision of having a statue created of himself 100 meters high made\nof pure lapis lazuli he is\njust collected $287-billion dollars on credit default swaps with aig and now wants to drill the amazon for one trillion dollars worth of\noil and become the world\u2019s first trillionaire this\nis an example of reducing what is going on to absurdity we have\nto have fun with this and at the same time experience the emotions of\nchange the\nnext slide and i believe the last slide is our information the\nlast slide gives the information about how to reach us what\ni had like to do is conclude with a one-minute meditation david\nsuggested this last night i think it is a wonderful idea and\nso just kind of relax loosen your clothes your body and so forth and just close your eyes and breathe a deep breath in feel the love\nand light that is present in this room right now then let go of\nany negativity in your out-breath any tension over-active mind stress just let it all go with each breath breathing again deeply\nfrom your stomach ahhhh then exhale and then imagine now a bright light coming through the top of your head\nwith each breath in and allow that light to surround your head and\nyour whole body and let that light spread out to the universe for\nthe highest good of everybody let it wrap over the planet earth and\nlet us become empowered to transform ourselves to the light we really\nare and the beauty of nature all around us just\nstay with that for about a few seconds as you breathe in with each\nbreath allowing the light to spread more and more to your\nneighbors to this room to the city of zurich switzerland this\nbeautiful country and let the light spread around the world to\neverybody let\nall negativity dissolve within this light because from the darkness\ndawns a new light and one more deep breath in then exhale and then\ngradually come back into the room we\ngive thanks for this opportunity to come together at the volkshaus and with gratitude toward bill and ruth and the ground crew the\nother speakers the translators that we can create a truly new\nworld thank\nyou ruth\nhuber (rh translator speaking german and then english bill made\nthe suggestion to finish off the conference and round it up right\nnow i did not really have any rousing speech finished for the last\nsection of today and even if i did i could not possibly cap\nthe presentation and the finale that brian aided by henry and david has just offered you here what i do want to do i want to ask if\ndan and marci are in the room are they here no they are not around i do not blame them at all actually i understood they held a wonderful workshop this morning and they\ndeserve a little bit of time and space and that is wonderful what\ni do want to do is just stress again that here we have seen in\nfront of us the opportunity that we have of creating the experience\nthat we want i\nwant to thank everyone who made this possible i want to thank ruth who is shared this vision with me and held it through a lot of\ninteresting times for many months and without whom this would not\nhave happened i\nwant to thank the swiss ground crew because it would not have\nhappened without them either stand up please stand up tina stand up rh they did a tremendous amount of work all\ntogether applause\nwhile ground crew all in red t-shirts assembles in front of stage]\n\n\n\nwe are going to have to do this again sometime otherwise i\ndo not know what people are going to do with these t-shirts and\nthis is not just the end of a conference i want you to consider\nthis as being the start of something else i want you guys to\norganize conferences of your own i want you guys to speak at\nconferences of your own i want you guys to encourage others to hold\nconferences of their own kerry\ncassidy and i are going to be in barcelona in two weeks time we invite you all to come to barcelona art do you want to come to\nbarcelona yeah hd i will be there too i am trying to find my excalibur\nsword there is a bunch of people holding a conference in amsterdam on\nthe 1st of august so find anyone with a badge with a dutch flag on\nit and ask them what is going on and they will tell you i have\nbeen invited to poland on the 5th and 6th of september i am\ndelighted to be going there i will go anywhere you like if you\nmake the coffee good enough and so probably would henry except that he likes lahsee unsure\nof word]\n\n\nand\ni have a very strong feeling that all kinds of amazing things are\ngoing to happen at the camelot conference in los angeles on the 19th\nand 20th of september david wilcock will be there henry will be\nthere i hope hd immigration problems immigration problems oh right doctor\npete peterson has told us that he will be there and based on our\nexperience this afternoon who knows who else will be there it is\npossible that the next time the swiss ground crew will be wearing\ntheir red shirts is for another event here in zurich where david\nicke is coming on the 14th of november and\nso there is a lot going on and there has been talk just today\nof an event held by the german ground crew and this is being created\nas i speak meanwhile brian is holding his own event in august and i cannot remember the\ndates brian bo\u2019l 22nd and 23rd and i think george green will be there we hope you\nwill be there but we realize you are traveling a lot so we can\ncreate another camelot conference at montesue\u00f1os and we hope\nyou can come art are there any immigration problems going to ecuador hd not that i know of i think you had really like vilcabamba hd i could live 156 years like i was supposed to bo\u2019l right it is the valley of longevity and very healthy fresh\norganic food and perfect climate it is the most wonderful food i have ever tasted in all of\nmy life i have\nbeen asked to mention the free energy congress brian you know\nexactly about as much of this as i do bo\u2019l this is actually new to me but it is in switzerland everything that is happened this weekend is going to be on the\ninternet in some form and for all i know some of it may already be and so all of this is recorded for a lot more people to be inspired\nby than the 300-plus who are here in this room i\njumped the gun there actually because david i wanted to ask you is there anything that you are doing that you would like to mention\nhere and invite people to take part in i will be speaking at the secrets conference in phoenix arizona and i will be sharing the stage at some\npoint with disclosure pioneer dr steven greer which i am very\nhappy about i am\nalso doing an event in toronto in september and that is the\nweekend of september 11th i will be speaking the entire weekend\nand singing some of my new music so you get about 16 hours of the\nkind of lecture content you saw yesterday in\nnovember i have a five-day resort getaway vacation in hawaii that\nwill be happening and next summer we are going to have a crop\ncircle tour in england for a week in\ngeneral i just want to thank every one of you for being here i only\nsee reflections of myself and i am very pleased with it i do\nbelieve there is only one of us here so please do not tear\nme to pieces as i am trying to leave the room but seriously i hope that what we can all take from this experience is\nthe gratitude for knowing the truth and the challenge to use it thank\nyou bill for bringing us out here and ruth i want to thank the people who have been manning the cameras it is been quite hard work and you have done an incredibly\nimportant job back there just give a round of applause to the camera\npeople without whom this would not be made available to the rest of\nthe world i have\nspent a lot of time on a lot of different planets in the last few\nmillion years and none of them have had as many countries and\nlanguages as this one so i want to thank the translators\nfor doing an invaluable job here this weekend ruth\nhuber ok ja ruth huber is my name ja you german-speaking people who are interested in anything to do with\nspiritual growth you have got to read her book rob\nfleischer from exopolitics germany who is going to be\nspeaking in barcelona at the exopolitics summit thomas\nkirschner from nexus magazine who has given us a huge amount of\nsupport kristina\nhollenvager kristina are\nyou in the room tell her to stand up so it takes a lot of people and lot of work a lot of intention and a\ncombined vision to hold a conference like this it is not easy but it is worth it so do not do the things in life which\nare easy  do the things in life which are worth it i\nwant to thank you all for being here we are going to be around\nfor a little bit i think to talk to people this is the intention\nthat we have is to make ourselves available to talk to people but more importantly make sure that you talk with each other this is a\nnetworking event we\ndo hope to see you here again in zurich sometime thank you ends\nwith brian o\u2019leary playing piano and the murmur of voices people talking to each other in the background]\n\nclick here for the video\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nintroduction please\nno the conclusions presented by researcher patrick geryl in this\ninterview will be found by many to be shocking and unacceptable we\nat project camelot do not agree with his final conclusions after\nsome discussion we have decided to publish the interview for two\nreasons there are issues brought up which merit discussion and a\nrecent discovery in egypt (the labyrinth at hawara which was\nextensively referenced by geryl is evidently real and of major\narchaeological significance enjoy\nthe interview \u2013 and recognize that geryl is probably talking\nabout the t2 catastrophe (see dan\nburisch\nmaterial which we are very confident has been averted see\nour major article 2009 a tale of two timelines for more information and references bill\nryan\nkerry\ncassidy\nproject\ncamelot\naugust\n2009\n\nthe interview kerry\ncassidy (kc hi i am kerry cassidy bill\nryan (br and i am bill ryan from project camelot it is august 1st no it is not it is august the 2nd okay i am sorry it is august 2nd 2009 you got the year right we are here with patrick geryl he is written a book\ncalled the world cataclysm\nin 2012 and it is\npretty amazing it is very very apocalyptic i think you might\nsay but you use your own description i had love you to tell the\npeople who you are and let us just start out with that your\nbackground patrick\ngeryl (pg right i am patrick geryl from belgium more than\n30 years ago i wrote a book the\nnew space-time dimension and i made several predictions about the universe i\nfound several faults in the theory of relativity and that was\npublished in the belgium press and i was on the belgian tv with that\nin 1990 i predicted an accelerating universe and that was found true\nin 1998 but nobody knows about this because it was only published\nin dutch and not in english last\nyear in 2008 another prediction of mine was found true that was\nvery fast galaxies near the speed of light i was the only one that\npredicted that more than 30 years ago now what has this to do with 2012 everything because i found that the\nmaya and the egyptians knew a theory about astronomy that is not\nknown by astronomers today it concerns the sunspot cycle theory i\nwas able to decode a large part of that theory and with that theory you can calculate the reversal of the magnetic field of the sun so this has got to do with solar cycle 24 yes right okay now with that theory the maya were able to calculate a big switch\nin the magnetic field of the sun also they count down with that\ntheory till december 2012 and at that moment in time a very large\napocalyptic sun-storm will destroy our civilization is it in the form of what some people call a coronal\nmass ejection or what ed\ndames for example calls the\nkill-shot is it this\nkind of thing yes it is that kind of thing that will happen in a few hours time the amount of energy from the sun the output will increase\ntremendously then a big solar storm with trillions of particles will\nbe thrown to the earth and that will destroy the magnetic field of\nthe earth in\nshort a shockwave from particles is coming to the earth that falls\ninto the magnetic field of the earth but the earth has an angle it\nis going with an angle of 23 degrees around the sun now the south pole is looking this way and the north pole is looking that\nway the polarity of the shockwave is a southern polarity so when it\nhits the earth you have a south pole here and a south pole there\nthat is coming now you have the inner core of the earth it is very small \u2013\nit is only 1,000 kilometers while the earth is 6,000 kilometers\n\u2013 and a south pole and a south pole they push away each other so the inner core of the earth will turn upside-down but if you take\na ball and you turn it upside-down while it is moving then you will\nsee that after the movement it will start turning the opposite\ndirection so while the inner core is coming upside-down the outer crust of the\nearth will start moving the other way around so now this time the\nearth is moving that way at\na certain moment of time the inner core starts to turn 180 degrees now it is a bit complicated to explain it in a short time\nbecause the outer crust of the earth will not go 180 degrees the\nreason is the equator has a bulge and to move over that bulge you\nneed an incredible amount of energy so\nwhat is my expectation if you look at the land masses you will see\nthat africa and europe have the largest land mass and it is difficult\nto move on the other side you have south america and the united\nstates in the other direction that can move more easily so\nmy expectation is that the land mass of south america and the united\nstates will move in one day 3,000 kilometers upwards and on the\nother side it will move 3,000 kilometers downward so canada will go\nunder the pole and south america will move equator-ward and even go\nover that while africa and europe will not move that much but\non the other side you have also that the rotation of the earth\nreverses while it now moves this way in one day it will move the\nother way around okay what are the effects at the moment that the inner core starts\nturning 180 degrees on its head all buildings on earth will be\nleveled down completely \u2013 it is 9/11 but on a worldwide\nscale in less than one minute nothing will remain then\nall volcanoes in the whole world will go off immediately and after\nthat while the rotation of the earth is stopping you will have a\ntidal wave of more than 1-1/2 kilometers worldwide because at\nthis moment the speed of the earth at the equator is about 1,600\nkilometers an hour at the equator that stops and it reverses the\nrotation it is a difference of more than 3,000 kilometers an\nhour in one day now if you are moving with a car and you stop you are pulled forward the oceans at that moment are pulled forward and that is the reason\nwhy we have these tidal waves okay now we want to go into this in more detail yes but before we do what i would like you to do is talk about your\nbackground in terms of what\nare your degrees what is your background in terms of what have you\nstudied in order to get you to this place well as explained when i was young i started studying astronomy\nand all the sciences i have read since more than 40 years\neverything about popular and more detailed science do you have ph.d for example no i do not have a ph.d but as i explained i was the only\none in the whole world who predicted an accelerating universe what does that mean i am just asking you about the term when you say accelerating yes now what is accelerating you mean expanding thirty years ago they said there is a big bang theory from the\nuniverse they said there was a long time ago billions of years ago there was one point and that exploded and then they saw the fastest\ngalaxies at that moment were about 33,000 kilometers per second so the expansion is accelerating also no no i am sorry at that time they said look there was an explosion and it will slow down because if you put\nsomething from the earth it goes up and then it slows down \u2013\nthe same principle from the universe but\ni had a completely different view and i said no no no this theory is not right because there are faults in the\ntheory of relativity now to explain that in short what faults were there in the theory of\nrelativity you have two theories \u2013 you have the special theory\nof relativity and you have the general theory of relativity with\nthe special theory of relativity you can say that if you accelerate\na mass to the speed of light that the mass will grow to infinity on\nthe other side you have the general theory of relativity then you\ncan calculate gravitation gravity now the two do not compare with each other if you accelerate our\nsun to the speed of light then it will have according to the special\nrelativity theory an infinite mass but you cannot calculate\nthat the gravitation will be then also infinite it is\nimpossible i understand so that is a fault in the theories of relativity so you must\nfind a theory that explains that if you accelerate a sun or a planet\nto the speed of light that the mass grows that also the gravitation\ngrows my\nidea was \u2013 and i speak from 40 years ago i was very young \u2013\nif you have a universe now let us imagine that there are on\nthe frontier of the universe galaxies near the speed of light then\nthere should be an infinite mass here while we are with our galaxy\nhere now if there is an infinite mass here then this infinite mass should\npull at the inner galaxies of our universe and they should be\naccelerated to that mass that was my theory there\nwere several things more than five predictions based on that so\nthey should find galaxies near the speed of light and then they\nshould find an accelerating universe they have found that then\nthe galaxies that are near the speed of light should be very old according to the big bang theory they should be very\nyoung so that is the\nopposite so you understand br yes it is a bit complicated and that is why i was the only one who\never predicted that and it was completely the reverse from what the\nothers were predicting i understand but where did you get this idea from in other words did you study to be an astronomer i have read since 40 years almost all articles that were\npublished about astronomy okay do you have a degree of any kind from a university no i do not have a degree of any kind but einstein did not\nhave also i understand so were you by trade were you an astronomer were\nyou a scientist no i am just a researcher i am a researcher okay now this idea did you get this idea did you meditate did\nyou do research and you added you know this thing and that thing to\nreach this conclusion or did you have an inspiration let us say one percent\ninspiration and 99 percent transpiration okay yeah perspiration we say in america perhaps perspiration okay okay so you have this theory and it is been proven right 40\nyears later yes how does this relate to the research you did on the mayan and other\ncivilizations in other words are you saying that this has happened\nbefore yes it happens every 11,500 years now you have ice ages did you see the movie ice\nage now before the\nmovie starts you see that the united states is under the ice and\nthen it is ice-free and then again it is under the ice and\nthen again it is ice-free and nobody knows why now if you take what i have explained that in one day united states and\ncanada will move a few thousands kilometers upward under the pole then you have an ice age and\nthat is the explanation of ice ages if you move very fast then\nalso it explains why there were mammoths found with the food still\nundigested in their mouth because in a few hours they froze to death so you are saying a pole shift is responsible for the ice ages a pole-shift is responsible for the ice ages okay are you then also saying that the sun is responsible for the\npole-shift yes the sun is responsible in every case in the past every case in the past and are you finding records that you know that back this idea up in other words records in ice cores no the ice ages are known ask every scientist that knows about it\nand he will say yes there are recurring ice ages in the united states and in europe\nbecause at the moment that the poles shift why\nis it warm in europe we are now here in holland now if you look at\nthe same is it latitude\nlike holland latitude yes latitude now you see at the same latitude in canada there is ice\naccumulated why is it warm here because of the gulf stream that is\nthe reason why it is warm here now if the gulf stream stopped then\nyou have also an ice age at the same moment in europe okay what about the precession of the equinoxes are you also\nrelating to that yes yes yes because i found in the book\nof the dead of the\negyptians that at that moment that there is pole-shift the\nprecession of the equinoxes is changed completely now\nwe are saying we are going to the age of aquarius we will never\nreach it we can end at the end of 2012 in a completely other age in\nlion or capricorn or i do not know i do not know yes we will be catapulted in one way because the rotation of the earth is\nnow this way and it will go the other way around so you are basically saying we will lose our latitude and longitude we have to make completely\nnew maps of the world it will be impossible if you are in the ocean\nto find where you are i have a question here patrick and that is that the scenario that\nyou described right at the start when you introduced yourself it is\nvery very specific with specific measurements you know the\n3,000-kilometer shift all of this but how did you decode this from\nthe relatively small amount of information that you have available because it happened in the past you have to look at the ice ages where the ice came in the past and then you can see that what i am\npredicting has between 80% to 90% chance of happening there is also\n10% to 20% chance that africa and europe will move forward but that\nis less likely but what is the connection between that and the data that you\nget from the mayans because there will be people watching this who\njust say well okay the\nmayans had this calendar and it seems to end or at least part of it\nseems to end before they go into the next larger cycle how\ndo you get all of your information from that now it is not only the maya because i found the most important\nthings in egypt there was a frenchman albert slosman and he\ntranslated more than 30 years ago a story of a high civilization that\nwas destroyed by a pole-shift now in that story was also translated that they calculated the last\npole-shift and that they were able to escape with unsinkable boats that they reached after a few days the coast of morocco and that\nthey went to egypt after thousands and thousands of years this is the atlantis catastrophe that is the atlantis story now the writer albert slosman wrote\ntwelve books in french about that and just prior to the publication\nin english he had an accident and died so they were never published\nin english and nobody knows about it i only know about it because\ni have read the books in french and they have never been translated they have never been translated in english okay now albert slosman he said look nobody will believe this but there is proof in egypt i looked proof in egypt he said yes there is in\negypt a building called the labyrinth\nand that building was\ndescribed by herodotus herodotus was an ancient historian where is the labyrinth patrick one moment i am sorry so herodotus visited the labyrinth 2,500 years ago and he wrote\nabout that because i bought the book of\nherodotus it is 700\npages thick he\nsaid look he said i have seen\nthe pyramids very impressive he said but he said i am now in the\nlabyrinth and i am walking here for hours and hours this is the\nmost amazing thing i have ever seen in my whole life it consists of\n3,000 rooms in two stories and i am only allowed from the egyptians\nto visit one the upper level and not the under level because the\nsecrets of egypt are there so after reading that i knew where i had to be now where was the\nlabyrinth that was a problem because nobody  ever found it hm herodotus was a good historian was not he yes very good because the last years he had described several\nthings from saqqara\nand they were found exactly now the egyptians were saying aw herodotus not so good he was a liar i speak from more than ten years ago so\nthe labyrinth is exaggerated it\nwas not exaggerated we found it last year nobody knows at the\nmoment it is now august but in november 2009 it will be on an\nnbc special from 2012 you say we\nfound it this was you and a team of people you found it a friend of mine  louis de cordier and me  we went to egypt in\ndecember 2007 because i had connections after years of years working\nwith the egyptians we wanted to scan with a geo-radar the labyrinth so it was only a sponsor that i needed and louis de cordier is an\nartist and he sells things for that he made a sun golden disk and he\nsold that to pay for the scanning of the labyrinth where were you looking for it your theory was actually that it was somewhere at the foot of the\nsphinx no no no no no absolutely not we did not know where it\nwas so i asked my friend at that time gino ratinckx he was an\narcheoastronomer \u2013 he had a degree in archaeology and in\nastronomy \u2013 and i asked him do\nyou know where the labyrinth could be i\nwill think about it and\ntwo weeks later he called me and he said look i found a clue and\ni said why he\nsaid look if we take a\nlabyrinth of stars in the sky and we project it to the earth then\nthat would be the place of the labyrinth and\ni said hey that is\ngood thinking and\nhe said well it looks to\nme it should be in hawara in where in hawara that is about 100 kilometers from the pyramids hawara okay so i said okay that\nmakes sense so\nwe visited a few months later  egypt and he found a connection\nbetween several temples \u2013 like the temple of dendera \u2013\nthat should be the star deneb and when we visited egypt we asked\nthem the boss from the temple is\nit connected to a star or something yes he said it is\nconnected to the star deneb and\ngino\u2019s look your\ntheory is right then we\nfound several other connections and then of course the conclusion\nwas the labyrinth should be in hawara okay so we went to hawara and i already knew that the archaeologists\ntalked at that moment that the labyrinth also should be at hawara but they were thinking that it was totally destroyed and nothing\nremained of it okay that was the theory in 1997 so\nin december 2007 i was with my friend louis de cordier in egypt\nand six weeks later the egyptians were scanning the labyrinth they\ntook a month to scan the labyrinth and we have what they found at\nhome the results and indeed the labyrinth is there it is 300\nmeters large 250 meters wide and 20 meters high so they found it underground or did they find something on the\nsurface no it is under water the problem is 200 years ago they\nneeded water and they took a side-river of the nile over it now the\negyptians are putting pumps and other material there to pump the\nwater out and also that the side-river of the nile or side-stream that is going over the labyrinth is put in how do you call\nthat that it will go into pipes oh i see yeah so the labyrinth itself is under water it is under water how did they discover any sign of it if it is under water did\nyou send divers down no no no no you can see it with a geo like a radar you can\nlook with radar under the ground and with that you can see clearly\nthat there are buildings there yes but you cannot see the details of what is in there no because of the water so the water\u2019s got to be pumped out first yes and now we have to do a new scanning that is a fascinating discovery and is this going to be announced you are saying in november um nbc went two times to egypt this year and they filmed in egypt\nand then they should release that the labyrinth has been found because at the moment dr hawass from egypt he is not releasing\nthe results but\nwe had in the university of ghent last year before 600 people that\ndr hawass came explaining that indeed he has found the labyrinth\nand that it is there it never went worldwide it was only published\nin the belgian press so the whole belgian press knew about it but\nit never went outside belgium this is a huge\ndiscovery this is the biggest thing ever in human history it is the biggest\nbuilding ever built it is 30 kilometers large why because if\nyou have 3,000 rooms and each room is only ten meters long then you\nhave 30 kilometers i thought he said it was only 300 meters yes but the total length of walking \u2013 3,000 rooms each room\nten meters now is this something that could\nbe connected with the hall of records yes it is the hall of records this is\nthe hall of records this is the hall of records everybody is looking at giza sorry guys wrong place you are at the wrong place it is in the labyrinth in\nhawara what are you expecting to find what information are you expecting\nto be in there we are looking for a room from granite sheeted in gold and there there are 36 hieroglyphs with the theory how they count down to\n2012 where did that information that idea come from that you are\nlooking for that the frenchman albert slosman translated that ahh yes is this again herodotus no no no it is from the frenchman albert slosman he\ntranslated that from the hieroglyphs on the temples in egypt i do not\nknow where because he died in 1981 i think so so on the temples in egypt it talked about the labyrinth and it yes and it talked about this room yes that contains this information about 2012 not about 2012 because the date is not released but if you go to\nthe temple of dendera you see that the age of pisces ends and it\ndoes not go to aquarius so it is at the end of this time\nthat the cataclysm will happen and that is the correlation with the mayan calendar that is the correlation with the mayan calendar because the\negyptians knew the same theory like the maya did okay but what you are saying in essence sounds like the end\nof civilization as we know it yes we will be completely wiped out only a few million people in\nthe whole world will survive this and these people will be where you have to be higher than two kilometers far away from volcanoes and earthquake resistant also if you are in south america and you\nare on a high mountain and you are pulled equator-wards then the\nmountain will collapse so that is a very hard place to survive and it is not very good news for the people in belgium and\nholland nobody can survive in holland in england or belgium because the\ntidal wave is 1.5 kilometers high it is described in the bible everything was under water it is\nnot only in the bible you can see on my website that there are\nstories from a worldwide flood and that everything was under water yep nobody can explain that but if you have a reversal of the rotation\nof the earth okay explanation complete is it possible that this theory could be wrong no absolutely not oh yeah why not that is a pretty strong statement yeah yes but i was also on the belgian television and i stated in 1990 look the universe has to\nexpand with an acceleration and everybody laughed at me and they said he is\nnuts and only eight\nyears later they said the\nuniverse is expanding with an acceleration is it possible that the force of acceleration is not as fast as you\nthink it is from what in other words it could be slower it could still accelerate or\nexpand but it could be slower less drastic do you have it about the universe or about what is happening in\n2012 you are saying that the universe is expanding or accelerating it is accelerating for a very short time of course and now\nit stops again huh what is going to create this acceleration suddenly no no no i explained that already what patrick is saying is he was right about that prediction so\nhe is right about this one no but i am saying if the universe is accelerating is it\naccelerating from the big bang no no no i explained that already in the beginning you have\ninfinite masses here that pull on the galaxies inside they are\naccelerating during a very short time and then the acceleration what time i do not know exactly but then the acceleration stops because\nyou are nearing the speed of light and you cannot go over the\nspeed of light but this is not important in respect to what we are\ntalking about it is irrelevant it is irrelevant well it is relevant because basically if that part of the theory is\nwrong then everything else may be wrong no no it is not correlated there is no connection there is no connection between the two it is only i\nexplained i was the only one that ever made such a prediction okay that was in complete the opposite from the other scientists okay then what are you saying will stimulate the sun to create this\nsolar flare such that it will engulf and cause the shift yes what is acting on the sun that is going to cause this it is the natural cycle every eleven years you have a change\nin the magnetic field of the sun eleven years eleven years the sunspot cycle the sunspot cycle at the northern part you have the plus first and\nat the southern part you have the minus first they change after\neleven years so that after 22 years you have the same plus again on\nthe sunspots now i was the first in the whole world to crack that the maya knew a\ntheory to describe the sunspot cycle it took me years to find it now in the last two weeks i was able to prove that the sunspots indeed change from plus to minus every eleven years and everybody\nwho is interested or is a good mathematician can ask me the theory\nand i can send it to him i think maurice\ncotterell says\nsomething similar does not he yes he says something similar it is based on his ideas but he\nmade several faults and i have corrected them i found at least five\nfaults in his theory and i needed to correct them so now i am able\nto calculate an eleven sunspot cycle theoretically and no astronomer\nin the whole world is able to do that understood just by coincidence a few days ago we met paul\nlaviolette yes i met him also very intelligent man very interesting man yes and of course you understand his theory about galactic superwaves\nwhich influence the sun in this periodic way so he is\ndescribing a possible mechanism to create the kind of thing that\nyou are talking about i think is that right yes but in fact the end result is about the same he does not\nbelieve in a pole shift but okay correct but we are talking about a cataclysm the only fault he made i sent\nhim \u2013 i spoke to him last year we met in rome about a\nconference about 2012 and i gave him my theory but he did not\nhave time enough to study it okay i am now trying to push several mathematicians already one of the\nbest mathematicians in the whole world has it that the theory is\nright but he does not want to release a statement because he\nsaid if i release a\nstatement that this theory is right we will have worldwide panic in\na very short time because everybody will know then that the maya\ncountdown with this theory and that the theory is right and that is\nmore than enough do you believe that the governments of the world know this no because they do not know this theory okay okay but this theory of the sunspots you say it is\nhappening every eleven years yes so we go through this no no that is a minor reversal where is the major yes yes yes but with that theory you can calculate a major\nreversal and that happens every 11,500 years in mean there are\nlonger and there are shorter cycles that is what is important that\nis what we will have to find in the labyrinth in egypt we want to\nfind the study of the sunspot cycle from the egyptians and then we\ncan calculate exactly the day that it will happen again so it is pretty important to get that information from the\nlabyrinth yes yes yes when will the water be pumped out if everything goes all right in 2010 around october or something\nlike that why is not this in every newspaper i mean this is incredible\ninformation about the labyrinth because dr hawass does not want to release the results of course i have more that i cannot say about it because what did we\nfind at the giza plateau okay right i was with polish friends at the giza plateau scanning there\nin 2006 and the end result was released it was said we have found\ntunnels that could lead to precious tombs and\nin 2007 the whole giza plateau was scanned but no results were\nreleased but i know that they found several caves and herodotus\nwrote in his book that cheops was not buried in the pyramid but\nthat he was laying around the giza plateau on an island i remember that yeah i remember that now that is\ninteresting right so i know more but i cannot say it but they are doing a tremendous amount of digging around the giza\nplateau right now no no no not a tremendous amount i have seen it oh yeah there are huge excavations happening\nright around the large pyramid right on the outside right in\nbetween near the the sphinx is here the large pyramid it is\nin this area there are huge diggings going on they have it\npartitioned off since when are they doing this i was there i think it was two years ago april 2006 yeah 2006 no no i know about that no no no that is all small\ndiggings because it is not allowed until 2012 to do large\ndiggings at the giza plateau how do you know that because that is the law in egypt it is not allowed until\n2012 why i do not know but it is 2012 okay well that is interesting yes so zahi hawass knows everything does he he does he does you think he does no he does not know about 2012 because my friends the polish were excavating at the labyrinth till three months ago dr hawass\nfound out between the connection from 2012 and the labyrinth and he\nstopped the excavations and they found already several things so\nthere were i think 80 egyptians excavating there the polish\nwere not excavating but they were paying for the egyptians to\nexcavate it hawass stopped the excavations and then the egyptians\ntook over so that is the latest what i know at the moment so they were excavating underwater no no the water is five meters deep from zero to five meters and they were looking there and they found several things are there photographs and films of this yes the polish have is this released is this available in the public domain at all part of it was on their website but they had to remove it from their\nwebsites from dr hawass and i do not know at the moment\nbecause i did not have time to correspond with them the last\nweeks so i do not know okay but i want to get back to the sun and also ask you what is\nacting on the sun to create this cycle you call it that is\nhappening every 11,500 years it has to do with the speed of the equator field and the polar\nfield if you look at the sun and the speed of the equator field you\nsee the sunspots moving \u2013 it is about 26 days at the pole\nfield that you cannot see from the earth it is 37 days now i am asking myself since more than 13 years how could the maya and\nthe egyptians know the speed of the polar field while you cannot\nsee it from the earth i\nhave no clue i have no idea but they studied the sun for thousands\nand thousand and thousand of years and so they must have seen\nsomething while they were doing it and been able to calculate it are you familiar with zecharia sitchin\u2019s work yes and what about the idea that the anunnaki were involved no no i do not believe it i believe there is 10,000% evidence that\nthere was a high civilization on earth that was destroyed by a polar\nshift we\nwill find the evidence in the labyrinth because we will find the hall\nof records where we can find how the earth looked like \u2013\nbecause antarctica was without ice there are maps from antarctica\nwithout ice and that we will find in the labyrinth and then everybody\nwill say wow we\nhave only a short time to live what are we going to do and at that\nmoment i think the worldwide economy will collapse in two weeks or\nsomething like that that is\nmy expectation because everybody will be so baffled that they will\nsay oh everything is\nover why would i work we will stop we will enjoy it we have only\na very short time left how long have you thought you have known this i knew this from september 2006 i had absolute proof then because i\nread the book from maurice\ncotterell the\nmayan prophecies and i\nsaw that his theory is not known by astronomers today then i started\nresearching and i found  about the books from the frenchman albert slosman that had translated that there was a high\ncivilization on earth that was able to calculate the last pole\nreversal then\ni connected the dots between the maya and egyptians and then i said look there is something\nin the theory from the sunspot cycle that has to be found and i was now able to crack a large part of that that is why i am so\nsure because this theory is not known by astronomers today what is been the response of people to this because this going\nto be quite hard for some people to listen to this yes you must have had this reaction many many times yes nobody wants to believe it they say look even if it is true we do not want to believe it what about the underground bases that the governments around the\nworld are building do not you think that perhaps that they know\nsomething about this theory i do not know if they would agree\nwith you completely but do you think that the bases are with the\nidea that they might survive they have no chance of survival because the earthquakes will be so\nlarge that there will be cracks in these underground bases and the\nwater from 1.5 kilometers will go through those cracks and they will\nkill everybody that is inside it so\nnow you have in norway a vault that will be completely destroyed no\ndoubt about it you have to be higher than two kilometers and that is\nthe only way to survive sure i understand but they are trying to protect against\nsomething they built the seed vault at svalbard yes they built that because they knew something it is possible that they know a lot more it is possible but i doubt it because they do not know this theory but i leave\nit in the middle but\neven then if they know something then they make terrible vaults\nbecause i do not want to be under the ground when there is a\ntidal wave from 1.5 kilometers so do you believe we have alien visitors on the earth at this time no i do not believe that i only believe in a high\ncivilization that is already hard enough to understand for everybody\nin the whole world meaning a high civilization that came from other planets no no no on earth that was able look we have a high civilization at this moment now when the cataclysm\nhits us all computers will be destroyed only books will survive if\nyou have to restart from scratch then that maybe will take another\n10- or 12,000 years before we have another high civilization that\nwill be destroyed again in a new cataclysm okay so you have one moment one moment i am not finished yet now how fast are we\ncompletely destroyed one\nhour because in one hour an electromagnetic pulse will destroy every\ncomputer nothing will remain except the books do\nwe have books above two kilometers or on a few places on earth that\nare higher than that but most of that will be destroyed in the\nearthquakes and then there will be rains what\nwill remain from what we know now at this moment almost nothing so\nyou want to restart something easy \u2013 you want to make iron do\nyou know how to make iron i do not know i need a book for\nthat do\nyou know how to make look you have tooth pain now you need\nsomething to relieve the pain do you know how to make it no you\ndo not know do you understand the problems sure we are back in the stone age no the stone age was better  because there will be no\nsun for 40 years there will be a dust of cloud around the earth for\n40 years from the volcanoes if you have seen the documentary from\nyellowstone park then you will know that if there is a large eruption\nfrom a super-volcano that there will be a dust cloud around the earth\nfor 45 years now\nwe are talking not about yellowstone park alone we are talking about\nalmost all volcanoes so there will be a dust cloud for 40 years\naround the earth no food no heat nothing let me ask you though if you do not believe ets are here on\nearth there have been reports that there have been craft spotted\naround the sun okay mm-hm have you heard these reports no i have not heard these reports but i am just saying my\ncase now nobody believes in a high civilization on earth and i have\nabsolute proof of that because well they believe in atlantis right they believe in atlantis but ask a scientist\nand they are way off i understand sure i have only one proof at the moment that there was a high\ncivilization on earth and that is the sunspot cycle theory this\ntheory is so incredibly complicated and not known by astronomers\ntoday that is the absolute proof hm interesting that is the absolute proof now let me ask you a sort of existential question if you like if\nit is so hopeless why are you even telling anybody because it\nsounds like the kind of thing that nobody can do anything about even\nif they knew exactly what was going to happen no no what can people do with the information no no we have a survival group and we want to survive in several\nplaces on earth the sierra nevada in spain and especially\nsomewhere a place in namibia or south africa or tanzania or\nethiopia because\nthere is another problem we have now a large part of the world\ncovered with nuclear plants they will melt down so it is impossible\nto live or to survive in europe and the united states and that is why you are looking at southern africa yes it will be contaminated for thousand and thousands and\nthousands of years now that is not the only problem the major problem is that the fuel that\nhas been used for the nuclear plants is at several places at the\nmoment and it is cooled down cooled down eh now if the cooling stops that disaster will be larger than the melting\nof all nuclear plants i asked a specialist about that and he said if that happens i do not\nknow if humanity can survive yeah we heard from somebody and i do not think we can say\nvery much about this on record but we did hear from somebody that\nthe movie the china\nsyndrome was based on a\nreal incident that has never been released do you know this movie the china syndrome yes i have seen the movie yes yes yes we have heard that is based on a real incident which is\nquite interesting we cannot prove it yes but chernobyl happened chernobyl certainly happened and so did three mile island i\nunderstand the point how about australia is australia a place\nto the high places are natural parks so you cannot build survival\nbunkers there so it is pretty hopeless i think not even inland i mean i guess inland you have just got desert\nso you cannot really the tidal wave is everywhere 1.5 kilometer high at least i think it is even nearer to two kilometers this is based though on a reversal on the sun first is this\ncorrect yes so if this reversal does not happen or if it is smaller in\nother words some of the predictions have talked about cmes \u2013\ncoronal mass ejections \u2013 hitting the earth but they will only\nhit certain parts of the earth momentarily so that it is not an\noverall situation no no no there is no doubt about what i am describing it will be\nworse than i am describing because the magnetic field of the earth is\nnow so weak that it can be easily overpowered in\nthe sixties and the seventies from the last century you could read\nin the popular scientific magazines and even in the real scientific\nmagazines that the north pole changes in the south pole on the earth\nevery 11,500 years because they found core reversal dates now what they knew has disappeared that knowledge i do not know\nwhy then they changed their mind and they said no it happens every 250,000 years or every 500,000 years so\nthey are just completely wrong i do not know why they changed\ntheir minds but the data are still there if you look in the\nscientific magazines from the last century you can find them and\nthey are described in the book not\nby fire but by ice by robert felix robert felix and he describes the articles where you can find them so he has also a new book out about what is going to happen and he\nalso says that we can be destroyed every moment by a new ice age but\nhe does not know the principle of a pole shift i have to say that i think at this point we have to talk about the\nmessage that we got from this person whose name we cannot\nrelease this is quite interesting patrick we need to tell you\nabout this in\noctober 2007 we were contacted by somebody whose name we recognized it was just a little message we often get them it is like i\nlove your website you are doing good work yeah we often get messages i am sure you get that the same no no i get bad messages i wonder why you fed my life up okay well we got a nice message it was just one line from this\nguy and he signed his name i recognized the name but it was quite a\ncommon name and i thought is\nthis who i think it might be and this is somebody whose name you would recognize too this is an\namerican guy he is a very well-known scientist and\ni wrote back to him saying are\nyou who i think you are he\nwrote back and said well actually yes i am and\nhe confirmed who he was and in the meantime we checked out his email\naddress and his ip this was the same guy i\nasked him what do you\nknow about what might be happening in the next few years because that was a time in october 2007 we were asking\nanybody that question if they knew something we were starting to get\nreally interested and\nhe said i have got some\nbad news and i do not like to be somebody who communicates bad\nnews but i can tell you this he said there will be three events a coronal mass ejection a\nmagnetic pole reversal and then finally a pole shift he said\nthat that is what he said he said that that is what he said yeah one two three he said that and then he said i am\nsorry i cannot say any more he is working with a top secret security clearance for the\ndepartment of homeland security in america yeah and what is a rocket scientist doing working for the department\nof homeland security this is a brilliant man he\nsays he is done the calculations and he said \u2013 his exact\nwords were we are\ngoing to be in for a very tough time and then he apologized for not being able to say more he said that\nwe were the first people he had communicated with outside of the\nnational security community for several years now i thought he was talking about three separate events and now what i\nhear you saying is that these three things are inter-related \u2013\nbang bang bang yes bang bang bang and that is making me feel very strange right now yeah right i am very surprised that he knows this because\nthis theory that i have discovered i only published that in my\nbooks but your books would be read by these people when did you publish\nthis that is possible when did you publish this the first time yes but then the theory was not final in 2001 a brief explanation\nof the sunspot cycle was in my book the\norion prophecy and then i\nthink it when was my book the\nworld cataclysm was not that 2005 something like that yes i forgot 2005 i think i have had it for a couple of years yes we had this email in october 2007 that is just what we got off record maybe we can tell you who this person is but to protect\nhim it is very very important that we do not tell his\nname you do not have t protect him anymore because i will be\nexplaining on history channel and nbc the new theory about sunspot\ncycle and everybody can take the theory from my website is it possible they go down into the labyrinth and that you find out\nthat there is something different there is something wrong\nwith your theory no there is nothing wrong the theory is absolutely right it has\nbeen proven right by one of the most brilliant mathematicians in the\nworld you mean this sunspot the sunspot cycle theory that i discovered in the book of the\ndresden codex of the maya so you are looking in the labyrinth and you expect to get some\nkind of validation for something in the labyrinth that is going\nto validate your entire theory absolutely we will find artifacts from the previous civilization\nand we expect also to find things there that we do not believe\nthey had okay do you have a name of that society that you think was the original\nadvanced civilization well it is called atlantis the atlanteans so you think it is atlantis that information in the labyrinth yes aha-men-ptah\n(atlantis translated by albert slosman and just out of interest curiosity where do you believe that was i believe the south pole oh really yes and that it went in one day under the ice that is what rand flem-ath and colin wilson say yes i believe that the theory is right because there is no other\nexplanation it was never found and if you say that it went under\nthe ice then that gives a complete explanation now what paul laviolette says and i do not have the\ninformation myself we asked him the same question he says that the\nice core samples from the south pole are continuous there is no\nperiod when there was not any ice is that correct no no no his data is not so good you have to read the book from\nrobert felix better and there are now new data from greenland that\nconfirms the ice ages okay which book by robert felix not\nby fire but by ice the two you have to read both of them yes okay also because of the shifting of the earth there is no consistency in all\nthe ice core data because 11,500 years  a part of the south\npole was not under ice and a part was under the ice so\nyou have to look at the part that was covered under\nthe ice 13,000 years ago you\nsee because otherwise there are differences if you have now a\nplace explain that again because i did not understand that i am\nsorry you have the south pole and it is free of ice right now the south pole is near the equator and it goes down in one day\nunder the ice and the part that was not covered by ice will be\ncovered by ice but you will not find in that part previous ice\nages you understand because it is new ice it is after the\ncataclysm okay so let me check what i think you are saying you are\nsaying that the discontinuity in the formation of the layers of ice\nwould not actually be visible yes it is not if you have the part from antarctica that was\nonce 11,000 - 12,000 years ago ice free then the ice is new there\nis only data till 11,800 years ago okay and if you think that the ice is laying there for hundreds of\nthousands of years then you make a fault and you cannot say\nsomething right about that data i understand it would be very interesting to talk to the two of you\ntogether i must say you have to go to further away to antarctica or you have to put\nthe data from greenland because greenland did not move that\nmuch and the ice core data from greenland that were released a few\nmonths ago they are exactly okay now i do not understand how some of the tectonic plates\n\u2013 you are talking about the tectonic plates moving \u2013\nhow some of the tectonic plates can move a lot and some not at all surely it is all going to move no it is all going to move you have to just take the peel of\nan orange unbound it and that is what will happen but when will\nthe crust move so this way that is only possible at the\nmoment that the earth stops rotating because you have at the equator\na bulge by the movement of the earth there is a bulge on the\nequator now at the moment that the inner core is almost upside-down then the\nrotation of the earth stops at the moment that the rotation of the\nearth stops the bulge disappears then the crust can slide easily\nover but\nthen the rotation starts again because it goes the other way around and the bulge appears again and stops the crust slide that is why\nyou have an inner core movement of 180 degrees and only 30 degrees\nfrom the crust okay so you know about the law of conservation of angular momentum yes so what you are saying is that angular momentum here actually\nis conserved because the total energy in the system stays the same although there are all these changes happening  is that right yeah there does not much happen in the energy but you have to\nunderstand that the crust is only 60 to 120 kilometers thick and that\nis the only movement so\nthe biggest part of the earth is going just upside-down and that\ndoes not need a lot of energy because now the scientists say look the rotation of the\nearth reversal is totally impossible you need too much energy for\nthat and\ni say look no you are\nwrong it is an upside-down movement of the earth that does not\ntake that much energy it is only the crust that gives the final\nrotation reversal okay i have a few questions it is a crustal displacement it is a crustal displacement and a crustal rotation movement okay but if you are saying that this crust is going to move\nand you said you had to be 100 kilometers below the surface no no the crust is only 60 to 120 kilometers if you go down 60 or\n100 kilometers then you have lava it is all floating about on a kind of liquid like the skim on\nmilk yeah is it possible they are building cities down there no you have lava so deep it is impossible you have\nlava there it is too warm if you go to south africa and you\nare in the gold mines i think it is incredibly hot at three\nkilometer depth it is incredibly hot yep it is very hot it is very very hot and if you go still deeper down it is\nimpossible you need a large amount of cooling to stay there yeah and what about the activity on the moon and the rest of the planets if the sun is going through this reversal what happens to the rest\nof the planets you will have there is frozen water on mars and then that will\nbe because mars has no atmosphere so the tidal wave from the sun\nwill release far more energy than on the earth so the frozen water\non mars will be liquid and there will be streams of water on mars\nfrom water that will be larger than on the earth and of course on mars it looks like this has happened before because there are huge canyons there yes because more than ten years ago you could read in the\nscientific magazines that they thought they had strong evidence that\nthere were streams on mars only twelve thousand years ago because\nthey saw stream patterns \u2013 that is with almost no hits\nfrom meteorites \u2013 and that is why they said this looks only\n12,000 years old but nobody has an explanation yep that is true okay but you are saying 12,000 and then you said 11,500 it is \u201cabout plus minus \u2013 because\nnow it has taken 11,800 years between the previous cycle and the next\ncycle and before that it was 11,500 years now the larger the\namount of time between the cycles the larger the release of the\nenergy of the sun so this destruction will be larger than the\nprevious one i see and you are convinced that it is going to happen\naround 11,800 years not 12,000 no there are smaller cycles and there are larger cycles so in the\negyptian book of the dead it is described that there were three destructions the last 40,000\nyears but there is also the thing about how you calculate when 2012\nor when this time period that ends with the mayan calendar etcetera it is not necessarily our year 2012 because the way we have\ncounted years have changed no no in the book of\nthe dead there is also a\nstar code that code is connected to the year of the previous\ncataclysm and in the previous cataclysm venus made a retrograde loop\nabove orion near the twins i have\nwritten that in my book how we discovered that and there is\nalso stated that if the code comes back then it is the year of the\nnext cataclysm and there is a chinese but the goat we are talking the year of capricorn right no no the code will appear again in 2012 venus will make a loop\nabove orion but it is a complicated code because you have also to\nlook at the precession and the precession from the last cataclysm is\nthe same like the precession in 2012 plus or minus 50 years but\nthere is more proof that the year 2012 is right not only the venus\ncode gives it but there are other codes that are hidden in the\ncountdown that give the year 2012 did not the chinese have a story in their mythology that there\nwas a time when the sun went backwards in the sky yeah not only the chinese but others also and that is because of\nthe reversal of the rotation of the earth now the egyptians they\nare saying \u2013 herodotus wrote about that \u2013 that in the\negyptian history the sun came up where it now goes down okay yes so now you do not have that only in the egyptians i get\nseveral emails from guys from the islam and they say look what you have discovered is in islam and\ni said oh i know it\nalready because a lot of people mailed that to me at the end of times it is written down in the islam the earth\nwill shiver terribly that is what it says in revelations it is the same thing is not it yes it is the same but they say it also in islam it will\nshiver terribly then you have only a very short time left for your\nsins because once the sun comes up where it now goes down that is\nwritten in the islam then you do not have time to ask\npermission for your sins to be released or something like that what about the position of the giza pyramid are you dating the giza\npyramid back earlier than originally thought the base of the big pyramid is older than what it is based and now\nthey say it is about 5,000 years old no the pyramids what is\nofficial there i think it is is it 4,500 it is about 4,500 bc no no no i am sorry 4,500 years\nold that is the official\ndating now albert slosman translated 5,500 years old so a thousand years\nolder okay but my understanding was that the orientation of the pyramid\nchanged no no it did not change it has to do with the precession so so you are saying that the precession of the equinoxes changed not the position of the pyramid on the earth no it does not what about stonehenge did you look at that at all no i did not look at stonehenge my research was basically\negypt and the dresden\ncodex of the maya also to connect all the dots with what i have written about\nunexplained mysteries like ice ages and so and how you can\nconnect that all together what are you planning to do personally in the next few years we have a survival group and we are working now with several members\nof that survival group we have visited south africa and we will\nvisit namibia and tanzania and the sierra nevada  to look\nif we have some places where we can build bunkers south america south america no because it is too dangerous because it will\nmove too much and there are too many volcanoes there so south\namerica and north america  we will not do anything there but are you looking only above what are you saying 2,000 meters two thousand meters yes even in africa even in africa yes but the biggest problem everywhere in the world\nis that above 2,000 meters most of it is natural parks everywhere\nin the whole world so that complicates our problem a lot because\notherwise it would be easy look you have the kingdom of lesotho\nin south africa it is very high and the problem is you cannot\nbuy land there and you cannot do anything there so the best\nplace in the whole world is lesotho and you cannot do anything\nthere botswana no no it is not high enough i think okay but the impact of a huge tidal wave is actually less as you go\ninland so for example in europe switzerland no no this is a reversal of the rotation of the earth and\naccording to old manuscripts it went three times around the world so the speed difference is 3,000 kilometers an hour now the earth\nis 40,000 kilometers at the equator so in\n13 hours it goes\naround the world but you are still going to get a wave just like a wave on the\nbeach as it goes in it is going to no no because the energy is going to dissipate it dissipates but it takes some time and according to old\nmanuscripts the last waves are the largest do not know why okay so let us talk about your website for the people so that they\ncan reference the things you are referring to and your website is how to survive 2012 dot com https www.howtosurvive2012.com/htm_night/home.htm\n ]\n\n\n\n  okay that is very simple yeah that is simple and you say you have a link there to the labyrinth information yes if you go to the labyrinth you have egypt then you have a\nlink there to the website of my friend louis\nde cordier who paid\nfor the scanning of the labyrinth unfortunately\nthe results are removed  but you can find all the information there\n because the results had to be removed from dr hawass okay because he asked you to remove them yes otherwise we were not allowed to enter egypt i see so you are going back in november to re-scan it no no no in november nbc will release that the labyrinth has\nbeen found okay they are releasing that the labyrinth has been found have they gone and filmed it were you part of the filming no no i was not part but a team from nbc went in i think in\nmarch to egypt and they filmed there  dr hawass about a\nconnection between 2012 and the labyrinth he will say of course that he does not believe in that then they interviewed dr abbas who did the scanning and he says the labyrinth is there why is it taking so long for them to release it you had think\nthat it could be out earlier than that they are waiting for the excavations okay right so is the water being drained by november no no the water will be drained next year  because they are\nnow making pipes there for the canal to be in a pipe and then also\nthey are building pumps and so  to pump the water out but that\nwill take a year that is a pretty big job it is a very big job and very costly yes and they have got to do it right yes they have got to do it right we hope they do not stop\nit because of the connection with 2012 because they stopped the\nexcavations from my polish friends a few months ago there must be governments of the world who will be i mean even\nif they do not know the intelligence agencies the militaries\nof the world must be aware of this information it is their job\nto find this information no no absolutely not nobody believes it because they do not\nknow it is\nthe same like i was saying 30 years ago in my book i said the\nuniverse is expanding with an acceleration nobody believed it then\neleven years ago they published it by themselves the\nuniverse is expanding with an acceleration and they reversed their standpoint completely they said the opposite\nfrom what they were saying previously now i think they will reverse their standpoint because of what i found\nwith the sunspot cycle theory it is on my website and i have an\nupdated version and if there is a good mathematician or a solar\nscientist he can ask it to me and he will be baffled with what i have\nfound because what i found is so complicated that well it has to\nbe true okay but do you have a background as a mathematician not really and therefore it took me years to find it but\nis has been found true now by a mathematician so i am working on it\nand it is possible that a mathematician from a university says\nthat it is right and that he can get it published no no he already said it is right but it is now the problem to get\nit published and to work on it because you cannot publish a\nbasic theory you have to use advanced mathematicians to do it and\nthat is now the second part we are working on okay would you say around the world you have any support out there\nwith scientists besides this particular mathematician there are a few people that believe that an ice age can happen every\nmoment but that is it but what about the reversal of the sun no nobody believes that nobody nobody believes that nobody i am the only one who is saying\nthat and i am the only one in the whole world who knows exactly what\nis going to happen okay well this is very extraordinary yes it is the same like it is a pity that my book\nabout the theory of the universe never was published in english otherwise you would have known about it much earlier but your website is in english my website is in english because i said look i made a fault by not publishing in english so i cannot make\nthe same fault again for the end of the world look my book was translated in english in 1997 and then i had to look for\na publisher and i did not find one nobody wanted to publish it\nuntil in 2000 i came in brussels in an english bookstore that is\nthere waterstones and they had the book about maps of the ancient sea kings the same\nwriter like that wrote about the pole shifts charles hapgood charles hapgood then i wrote to the publisher of that and it was\ndavid\nhatcher childress in\nthe united states oh yeah right right and i asked him look do you want to publish my book and\nhe said if you pay for\nit and i\nwill be in amsterdam in a few months come to me and speak to me and\ni went to him and i said okay it is okay i will pay for the publication of my book so that started everything have you sold a lot of books the orion prophecy\ni believe is now around 30,000 in english but in polish because i\nhad several documentaries in polish i sold 50,000 copies from my\nthree books in polish uh-huh what is your native language dutch dutch yes do you speak polish no absolutely not i do not understand anything there is just a special interest in poland for your work no a few years how long is it ago i think six years ago a\npolish man read my book in polish \u2013 because the\norion prophecy was rather\nquickly translated in polish \u2013 and he said look nobody believes you i think i\nsaid yeah that is true i\nwill help you to find the labyrinth in egypt i\nsaid okay then he came to belgium a few months later and we talked with each\nother that is the guy who made connection with the department of\nastronomy and geophysics in egypt they scanned the giza plateau in\n2006 and with that connection i was able to scan the labyrinth okay prior to that were there any theories about where the\nlabyrinth was were you the first one to initiate this no no the archaeologists already said that according to what they\nthought the labyrinth should be in hawara but there were no\nexcavations and they thought it was completely destroyed and\ni said completely\ndestroyed such a large building that is impossible it still has to\nbe there and we were the\nfirst to scan it are there any pyramids as part of the labyrinth there is a pyramid standing near the labyrinth but it is mainly\ncollapsed because it is made the upper level of brick stones but\nthe under level is in stone and granite as we can see there is a\nconnection with the labyrinth and that was described by herodotus so\nthe labyrinth should be there it is there that is a fascinating story yes herodotus wrote in greek or in latin in greek in\ngreek i was a few years ago in turkey bodrum it is called it is\na very famous like\ncannes \u2013 like cannes from turkey \u2013 and he lived there he\nwas born there but that was ancient greece yes okay i understand he was a famous historian he was very reliable he was a scholar yes do you read greek no so you had to read a translation it was a translation yes was it accurate do you feel well you have translations in english and in dutch so it was a\nnew translation in dutch i see he is been very well translated his work is not disputed\nat all i just wondered and he was the greeks were very methodical and meticulous they\nwere academics they took pride in their scholarship plato\nwas another one he was right about everything and why should people\nsay that he was wrong about atlantis yeah but plato did say atlantis was i understand that herodotus was particularly interested in egyptian\nhistory is not that right yes he was very good but plato was apparently if you follow your theories plato was\nwrong about the location of atlantis no no absolutely not plato said south of the equator yes but everybody misinterpreted what he said it is antarctica all that plato said was that is was beyond\nthe pillars of hercules\nand what that means is that it was outside of the mediterranean yes and that also applies to also to antarctica yes so he was not wrong about that most people think that that\nmeans in the middle of the atlantic of course some people still do\nthink that and that is a whole other discussion most of them think it there are thousands of places that they think\nwhere atlantis could be so only a few people think antarctica we\nwill find that in the labyrinth okay but do you think they will release it in other words i\nknow they are going to talk about it in november and\nnbc is going to but they do not usually release a lot of\ninformation to the public so\nwhat do you think is there a possibility that because your theory\nmight be true they might actually withhold this information i do not know what will happen it depends from what the media\nwill do with it the belgian press published about my theories but\nthere was not that many response because of the opposition of the\nscientists because i was on tv and afterward they give scientists but these scientists are all wrong now because they did not know the latest data from the nasa in\n2008 in december nasa published that they found a new theory about\nthe protection of the earth if\na wave from the sun with a northern polarity hits the earth first then the southern polarity field of the earth is totally unprotected the scientists from nasa wrote on their website this\nis the same as saying that the sun will come up in the west now if you connect the dots this explains why the sun will come up in\nthe west because if you have a follow-up big wave with southern\npolarity then everything will happen what i explained there\nis another theory from nasa that there will be a huge activity of the\nsun in 2012 that is enough it is coming from nasa it is not\ncoming from me i am not saying that nasa is saying\nthat that is right yes solar cycle 24 they were saying that a couple years ago yeah but expect now that nasa will say no no nothing will happen in 2012 after the movie and all the things or i do not know what will\nhappen but you are telling us that you have been i do not\nknow were you just interviewed by history channel history channel nbc yes nbc okay and they will release that interview when i do not know you do not know nbc in november do you have an exact date for it no just prior to the movie prior to the movie what movie the 2012 movie oh yeah yes that is about the pole shift the destruction of everything so they interviewed you in association with that movie yes sony pictures interviewed me also and they said that they will\nrelease a part of that interview just before the movie starts and did the filmmakers read your work and were they influenced by\nyou i am absolutely sure about that because my book the\norion prophecy was\npublished in 2001 and there is only one guy in the whole world\nthat wrote about a pole shift in 2012 and that is me ah at that time no at the moment you cannot find any book that is similar like\nmine that describes what will happen nothing i am the only\none so it has to be based on my book because it is also in the movie\nhe says about unsinkable boats i wrote about an unsinkable boat in\nmy book also and about the pole shift so he made several faults in his movie of course it is a movie it is a hollywood movie it has to be spectacular of course so okay well certainly the destruction of civilization is quite\nspectacular regardless of how hollywood makes it right right well patrick geryl thank you very much okay it is been a pleasure you are very eloquent your\ntheories are very very dire but we will see what\nhappens will not we i think at the beginning you used the word apocalyptic\nand that is a good word to use yeah apocalyptic i had like to thank you too it is interesting stuff actually i had not read your book and i will now do so absolutely yeah right and then you will know everything and you will see that\nit is far more dire than i explained okay and then i am going to quit work and just start partying that is the best thing you can do that is the best thing\nyou can do thank you very much david icke (di ok no problem and then we will just kind of run with it and\n                  see how it goes.bill ryan (br something that i would like to say is\n                  that i think we get more emails and have done over the three\n                  years that we have been going asking us to interview you and wondering if there is some weird reason why we have not and now we are both together here we are it is all synchronistic in the end in the end absolutely so we are here in sedona and you are\n                  here and it was great that we were able to connect with you great so where we want to go with this is we have whistle\n                  blowers and i am curious have you got your own sort\n                  of secret sources that have been giving you information through\n                  the years no what happened to me is i had an extraordinary\n                  experience or series of experiences in the early 1990s i\n                  was a television presenter and a national spokesman for the\n                  british green party suddenly i felt over 1989 that there was a \u201cpresence in\n                  the room whenever i was alone and it became more and more\n                  tangible as 1989 unfolded it was bizarre really cause\n                  the green party in britain had their biggest electoral year\n                  in 1989 out of european elections and i was going through all this whenever i was in a room\n                  alone like a hotel room or something there was this presence you know eventually it got so powerful towards the end of \u201989\n                  that i was sitting on the side of a bed in a hotel called the\n                  kensington hilton in london just down from the bbc headquarters i know it and i said to this apparently empty room look if there is something there would you please contact\n                    me because you are driving me up the wall.about two weeks later it must have been i am with my\n                  son he was a little boy then he is a singer-songwriter\n                  now in his mid-20s he is six foot four yes this is gaz gareth we were playing football and we were going to go down into the town and get some lunch i lived in a seaside resort in a place called the isle of wight\n                  in england and as we got down toward this \u2018greasy joe cafe somebody some railway worker stopped me and started talking\n                  about football because i was on the television talking about\n                  sport and stuff then after this conversation was finished i saw that gareth\n                  was not there i knew where he would be he would be in\n                  the news shop just down next to us so i walked in and he\n                  was reading steam train books because he liked steam trains like me and i said to him come on gareth we will\n                  go and get some lunch.and as i turned my feet would not move now this is\n                  a guy who is not been into any of this stuff he is\n                  a television presenter national spokesman for the green party a journalist basically and my feet would not move and i heard \u2013 it was not really a voice but a\n                  very strong thought-form passed through my mind which did not\n                  seem attached to me why would i think it and it said go\n                  and look at the books on the far side so i went over and in among the romantic novels was this\n                  book with a woman\u2019s face on the front i picked it up because\n                  it was so different to the rest turned it over saw the word psychic so i read this book in 24 hours and i wrote to her and went\n                  to see her and what i told her was i had arthritis - which\n                  i have - and maybe a hands-on healing would help i told her\n                  not the real reason i went which was would she pick up\n                  what the heck this presence is i had been feeling for nearly\n                  a year well actually a full year by then.i went the first couple of times \u2013 and i saw her four\n                  times  and she did the hands-on healing and we had a chat\n                  about other dimensions and stuff it all made sense to me because i had always rejected religion and i had always\n                  rejected the scientific view of reality i just had not\n                  focused on ok what is the alternative and then the third time i went i am lying there on this\n                  medical-type bench thing and i felt like a spider\u2019s\n                  web on my face which really took me aback because i had read\n                  in her book that when other dimensions or whatever spirits\n                  or whatever you want to use are trying to lock in to you you sometimes feel like a spider\u2019s web on your face well funny enough i never had before and i never have since but at that moment it was seriously powerful real tangible so i am going oh my goodness what is going\n                  on and she is kind of doing this by my left knee and\n                  i never said a word to her and then suddenly she launches her head back and goes my\n                    god i have got to close my eyes for this one this is\n                    powerful and she sees this figure in her mind she\n                    says this figure  or whatever she called it  is\n                    asking me to pass information to you take into account you know i am a television presenter presenting the sport and the news at the time and suddenly she starts saying that this entity or this projection\n                  of consciousness was saying that i was going to go out on\n                  a world stage eventually and reveal great secrets that there\n                  was a shadow across the world that had to be lifted that there\n                  was going to be a spiritual revolution in my lifetime because\n                  of a vibrational change that is why the first book i wrote was called truth\n                    vibrations after that vibrational change and one line\n                    was one man cannot change the world but one man can\n                    communicate the message that will change the world i\n                    would write five books in three years i am sitting there thinking i know nothing about\n                    this stuff five books in three years you must be having a laugh you know this was all new\n                    to me i wrote five books in three years to the month and i did not\n                  realize i had done it until i realized it was five and\n                  then went back it was five books to the month in three years\n                  from that time i went back another time and the next time there was some\n                  more so i left and waited something felt right about it even though my mind\u2019s\n                  going what what within weeks the bbc had decided they were not going to\n                  renew my contact even though i was the youngest one in their\n                  department i was an in-by-a-mile presenter and it would seem\n                  that i would have had a lifetime a working-lifetime future\n                  there when i look back at that thought my emotional chakra you\n                  know starts vibrating wildly the thought of being in the\n                  media all my life oh my god when i look back nightmare.anyway so now i am out of work but i feel i have to\n                  go with this and fortunately i have always lived below\n                  my income because i have a very you know i am minimalist\n                  me i had rather have the money to go to india than a big\n                  house with a mortgage on it anyway so i had enough money to keep me going for a year and then it all started this synchronistic almost-daily ah this daily journey through a maze and when i started\n                  out it was a thick maze i had no idea what this was all about i just felt i had to go with it i did not even know why\n                  i had to go with it i just had this gotta go with this and what is happened is it is like some force has\n                  been opening and closing doors so i go down this road\n                  in a maze and not this one and so coming around to answering your question directly i just follow and have followed now for nearly 20 years this\n                  pulsing this urging this knowing that passes through me so i edit my life on the basis of that will you go here do not\n                  feel to will you go here yeah i will be there and what has happened as the result of just doing that is\n                  i have walked into people experiences information books documents which has taken me when i look back on a very\n                  specific journey i have described it before it is\n                  like you try to put a jigsaw puzzle together and some force\n                  is handing you the pieces we feel the exact same way we have had the same experience almost in the right order that you can encompass\n                  them in the picture most easily mm hm and so first of all in the early years of the \u201990s\n                  and through to about 1996 all the synchronicity was about\n                  the five-sense level of this conspiracy  banking scams families\n                  connecting the same people behind this and behind that and\n                  behind that who is behind the drug networks and all\n                  that stuff banking families and engineered wars what was really behind\n                  the second world war the first world war and what is\n                  this network that is the guiding force of this conspiracy all that stuff and then from about \u201996 when i came to america to talk\n                  about this for the first time and lots of people turned\n                  up i talked to eight people in chicago i remember that that\n                  was what you might call an expeditionary three months because\n                  i was talking to myself most of the time but i was picking\n                  up information as i passed around what started then from 1996 onwards was the next stage of\n                  this which is these families which i had learned so much\n                  about in the years before were actually connected to some\n                  non-human race or entities for which they were basically\n                  fronting-up an agenda within this five-sense reality that is\n                  when i went into the whole reptilian stuff of course the synchronicity of my life and my personal journey and my communication of information are fundamentally connected because a massive part of my life is as i have been learning\n                  more and more you know my personal journey has been clearing\n                  out my own body computer programming so that i can access higher\n                  and higher levels of consciousness of course everyone\u2019s\n                  got the opportunity to do that and many people are doing it\n                  now so i have had great challenges in my life at the same\n                  time as doing the information to break this up \u2013 break\n                  these programs up one of the biggest ones happened in 1991\n                  when i started talking about what was happening to me of course i was a well-known television presenter in britain so there was monumental ridicule of a kind that few people\n                  can actually experience i mean i would walk down the street\n                  and be laughed at by most of the people in the street for like\n                  two three years a comedian only had to say my name no joke\n                  necessary and get a laugh but can we go back to that because i would\n                  love to sort of drill down and find out what how did you\n                  actually get into the reptilian situation well yeah what i was just going to say the reason\n                  i bring this up about the synchronicity of my life is because\n                  from 1996 when i started going through the reptilian stuff because i had been through that massive ridicule in the\n                  early 1990s it had cleared me out of the key thing that most\n                  people live in - the prison that most people live in - which\n                  is the fear of what other people think therefore to me coming\n                  out from the late \u201990s about the reptilian stuff was\n                  not a problem because the level of ridicule could not be greater\n                  than what is before but why did you have ridicule before because the\n                  only ridicule i knew was about the reptilians oh no i will tell you another story that leads\n                  into that towards the end of 1990 when i had finished the\n                  book truth vibrations and it went off to the publisher\n                  to be published in the spring of 1991 i had this overwhelming\n                  feeling - again the urge the impulse - to go to peru and\n                  i had no idea why i just had to go to peru so i get on a plane to peru not knowing why i am going\n                  there and i land in lima airport from the moment i landed\n                  amazing synchronistic things happened but eventually i had\n                  this peruvian guide chap who was taking me around funnily enough the first time i met that guy was in cuzco in the old inca region and i went \u2019round to his house because we were going off traveling around peru from that day and he is lying on his back asleep and i walked in because\n                  the door was open and he looked up at me and he said not hello but did you have any dreams last night what i said well actually i did i said i\n                    had a real big clear technicolor dream that one of these\n                    two front teeth fell out cannot remember which\n                    one.and he said is your father or grandfather still alive i said well my father is yeah i said why?he said well that is usually symbolic of your father\n                    or your grandfather dying i thought well this guy\u2019s gonna be a bunch of laughs\n                    for the next three weeks wow and when i next got a call out of peru my father\n                  had died back in england it was unbelievable oh my god anyway i go around with this guy and where it all\n                  leads which kind of fundamentally it leads to the reason\n                  behind the ridicule eventually he put us in a hotel called the sillustani in puno it is kind of southern peru not far from lake titicaca the sillustani hotel was named after an inca ruin site about\n                  an hour hour-and-a-half\u2019s drive away so there is\n                  pictures of this place all over the hotel of the ruins and\n                  i said to the guy i want to go there so we go out i think he did a deal to get some money out\n                  of me because i go out in like a little tourist bus with windows\n                  on the side with a tourist bus driver and the guide and me nobody else we go out to this place and it is in the middle of nowhere basically when you looked around it was encircled by mountains\n                  - in the distance mind and i go there the only people there\n                  are a couple of children with llamas for tourist photographs but there were no tourists so i walk around for about an hour and it is very nice it is on a hill with a lagoon on three sides i go back\n                  to the car and i am it was nice but it did not\n                  match the urge i had to go there so i get into the van thing and we start to drive away and\n                  i am looking out the window day-dreaming and i see this\n                  mound to my right it must have been no more than three minutes\n                  down the road and as i look at the mound all i can hear in\n                  my head is come to me come to me come to me come to\n                  me what i am really new to this stuff i mean what is\n                  going on with my life so i said to the guide can you stop the van the\n                  bus thing i am going up the mound so i went\n                  up the mound i could not see it from the road but when\n                  i got to the top there was a circle of standing stones about\n                  waist-high these stones had obviously been there a very very\n                  long time so i walk into the middle of this circle and i am looking\n                  across to sillustani and across to the distant mountains and it is a piercing-hot peruvian day no clouds not\n                  a cloud in the sky very much like this one today i walked to the center of the circle and suddenly my feet\n                  go again like they did in the news shop but only seriously\n                  more powerful there\u2019re like magnets pulling my feet\n                  to the ground and i think oh crikey i recognize that here we go and then i felt like a drill going in the top of my head and\n                  through my body through my feet into the ground and then\n                  another one coming the other way and then my arms go out at 45 degrees like that i never made\n                  any decision to do it and of course you hold your arms out\n                  there for a minute it starts to ache or my shoulders do anyway it was the best part of an hour it must be 45 minutes to\n                  an hour my arms were like that when it was over my shoulders\n                  were agony but when it was going on nothing what then started to happen is this energy coming through\n                  me this is february 1991 it got more and more powerful my\n                  body started to shake with it and i had two very powerful\n                  thought-forms pass through my head just like in the news shop the first one said they will be talking about this\n                    100 years from now and i am thinking talking\n                    about what and the other one was it will be over when you feel the\n                    rain i have just described what the weather was\n                    like it will be over when you feel the rain i mean you are having a laugh mate so what happened then for the next 45 minutes  because\n                  time disappeared there was no time i worked it out later \u2013 was\n                  that this energy just kept coming through me and i kept going\n                  in and out of if you like awareness consciousness like\n                  driving a car and you go crikey where did the last two\n                  miles go one of these times when i came back to kind of awareness i noticed that over the distant mountains there was a light\n                  gray mist and kind of as i watched it it got darker and darker\n                  very quickly and i realized it was pouring rain on the distant\n                  mountains over the next little while however long it was i watched\n                  this storm come out of the mountains weather people talk about you know a \u201cweather front well this was a straight\n                  line the cloud was a straight line i have described it\n                  many times it was like drawing the curtains across the sky.this thing\u2019s coming towards me and as it got closer the sun\u2019s gone it is been covered all the clouds\n                  are billowing and i am seeing faces in the clouds it\n                  did not make sense to me but i saw faces in the clouds and then it is a wall of rain i am watching it\n                  coming towards me by this time i am hanging on you know with this energy coming through me eventually it hits me -\n                  torrential rain - and everything stopped that is when\n                  i staggered forward and my shoulders were agony and all the\n                  rest of it many other things happened but when i came back to england\n                  after that as i said earlier my book was published in the\n                  early part of 1991 which is a matter of a very short time\n                  after this experience.when i look back now it was like you know if you have\n                  got a dam and it is holding water back the water is calm\n                  - right because that is its natural state in that situation if you like but when the dam bursts before a new balance\n                  is found after the damn bursts all hell breaks loose in the\n                  water - right as it is trying to go from one state\n                  to another yep when i look back what happened to me on that mound it was like the waters of my mind bursting and for three months\n                  i did not know what planet i was on right in the middle of this my book came out and i went on the\n                  biggest live-chat show in britain at the time  it was called\n                  the wogan show  in a complete bloody daze about\n                  what was happening to me it had all been in the national papers\n                  that basically i had gone crazy and i was sitting in this chair in the chat show and the audience\n                  was laughing within a minute two minutes and they basically\n                  laughed for i think i must have been on about fifteen sixteen seventeen minutes and from that moment on because i was talking\n                  about what was happening to me except i did not understand\n                  what was happening to me and what that did was trigger the\n                  most extraordinary levels of ridicule and ah it cleared\n                  me out of that fear of what other people think but i learned so much about human behavior i remember because\n                  what you are supposed to do when you face that scale of\n                  ridicule is run and hide right that is one of the means that is used to control\n                  us yeah so what i did is i went on a university speaking\n                  tour  in front of all these students who had\n                  not come to listen they had come to laugh right my understanding is that what you had is a kundalini\n                  experience do you relate to it like that or do you call it\n                  something else i do not care but have you investigated or has anyone talked to\n                  you about that no no i mean i have talked to people about\n                  kundalini experience and maybe it was see what i do  i\n                  can only talk for myself \u2013 is what is is you\n                  know one of the things that was said to me by the psychic or through\n                  the psychic in 1990 when all this started for me was they are\n                  saying you will face enormous opposition but they will\n                  always be there to protect you now i do not know who they are i have\n                  hardly even thought about who they are because when\n                  i leave this genetic spacesuit i will know who they are all\n                  i do is i go with my intuition and what happened to me in 1991 with the great ridicule was as life so often does it gave me my greatest gift brilliantly\n                  disguised as my worst nightmare because that is what\n                  it was at the time and in the experiencing of it so what actually happened to me is something transformed\n                  my sense of perception and that is good enough for me i do not really have to know the detail of what happened but a kundalini experience it could well have been yeah and in the meantime it is got something to\n                  do with tempering the steel say again tempering the steel tempering the steel yeah because as i keep coming\n                  back to my personal journey and what i am doing in\n                  terms of communicating information absolutely are one i was going to say what happened to me when i went out on that\n                  university speaking tour it was the university of nottingham there were a thousand people there i would say 950 had come\n                  to laugh i walked out on the stage and it was literally the\n                  best part of fifteen minutes before i could speak because\n                  it was just abuse ridicule laughter plastic beer glasses\n                  thrown at the stage i just stood there and waited for it to die down because\n                  it had to eventually and when it did i said you think\n                  i am mentally ill do not you and you know\n                  what it is like wellll\n                  yuuh and i said so what does that say about you because you have\n                    actually paid to come here to ridicule someone you actually\n                    believe is mentally ill i tell you what you could hear a pin drop and you could hear a pin drop\n                    for the rest of the night to do what i have done in terms of talking about some\n                  really bizarre things you know my name still only has to\n                  be mentioned in a national newspaper in britain and it is\n                  like complete ridicule whatever i am saying it is toned down a bit a little bit but not very much i mean i stood\n                  for election in a parliamentary bi-election in july last year july 2008  not to get elected  i knew i would not\n                  get any votes i did not want any votes i mean i must\n                  be the first parliamentary candidate ever to put out a leaflet\n                  to everyone in the constituency saying i do not want\n                  your votes just your brief attention goodness me i\n                  did not want to get involved in that but again it was\n                  a great experience and i learned a lot from it but the media coverage was i did a media presentation for\n                  the national press which was about i do not know 50\n                  minutes powerpoint pictures and stuff in which i talked about\n                  the five-sense level of it because anything else i mean even that blew their bloody minds anything else reptilians i mean crikey what they did is they just went away and just abused me and\n                  abused it and ridiculed me and ironically the one that did\n                  the most abuse one of the things i said was coming actually\n                  about six weeks later was actually the front page story in\n                  his own newspaper i mean it is bizarre these people\n                  have total cognitive dissonance so that they cannot put\n                  these two things together so it is still there but it does not matter you\n                  know we are in a situation where thanks to the internet we can bypass these sad people that work with their concrete\n                  minds in the mainstream media and you do not have to reach everybody just\n                  enough people it is the hundredth monkey principle yeah i will tell you what i feel more and more you know i mean look i can feel it when i speak anyone\n                  speaks it is a vibrational communication there is\n                  silence between you and me there is silence when you\n                  speak to me until my brain\u2019s decoded it what it is is vibrational communication and i feel very\n                  strongly that it is not just the people that hear this\n                  information it is the fact that this information\u2019s\n                  circulating.if you do an interview for a radio station 100,000 people\n                  might listen to it but that broadcast frequency carrying that\n                  information is passing through the ether if you like and\n                  is there to be potentially picked up by people who do not\n                  even listen to the radio interview it touches them on a vibrational\n                  level and you know i think that is right you are talking\n                  about the butterfly effect in essence yeah it it multiples that is actually a very good\n                  way to put it you know on a subliminal level because we\n                  exist on so many different levels mm hm exactly it is like waves it is actually it is\n                  hitting them and there is the line that i have been\n                  quoting lately that says you know we learn by osmosis\n                  just as much as by word it actually permeates just by\n                  osmosis yes into our skin into our brain exactly we are receivers exactly we are receiver transmitters that is\n                  what we are but people think that the only form of communication\n                  is voice-to-ear i will tell you a funny story in 2003 i was in the rain\n                  forest of brazil and i took this ayahuasca psychoactive\n                  drug somebody did not tell me i was taking a psychoactive\n                  drug but i am glad i did though it was fantastic a\n                  lot of people have bad experience but this female voice talked to me as loud as mine is now for\n                  five hours about how reality physical reality is an illusion absolutely riveting stuff very very funny i mean my feet\n                  were the air a couple of times it was so funny what was coming\n                  out and as the voice was telling me things i saw pictures that\n                  obviously were being projected there was one where i walked\n                  out on a stage and there was an audience i just saw the front\n                  of the audience here and this voice said you only speak\n                  words to keep the mind happy basically to keep the brain happy and as this voice was saying this i saw two women in the\n                  front row of this scene that had been projected to me and\n                  i had walked out to the front of the stage and i had\n                  just stood there and just said nothing \u2013 silence and\n                  after a while this one woman nudges the other one like that\n                  and goes basically what is he doing and the voice it was so funny what it said because it came\n                  out of nowhere the voice said you only speak because\n                  if you did not the audience would be asking when the f is he going to start that actually carries a profound kind of understanding because\n                  the real communication between all of us is unspoken absolutely and this is very good news and this is what i would\n                  impress upon people the more you speak your truth - even if\n                  people are not listening - you are changing or offering a vibrational field which other people can tune into.you know when i look at the speed at which people are awakening it is not just because of information on the internet it is not just because of information in my books or someone\n                  else\u2019s books there is something massive going on vibrationally which\n                  fits totally with what i got through that psychic in 1990 which was there is a spiritual revolution coming and it is\n                  taking the form of a vibrational change i can see it in 1990 - no evidence now i mean please you can see it i had people come up to me in la when i spoke\n                  there recently saying i was absolutely a part of the\n                  system until three months ago right i read one of your books and suddenly i am\n                    just totally different now it is not just because they read one of\n                  my books if you start tuning in to this vibrational change then bang things can happen real real quick and personally i find it such a good thing that from my experience i went\n                  through all that that nightmare experience in the early\n                  1990s when i started to awake not knowing what the hell was\n                  happening because now you can explain to people that if you have an\n                  energetic construct here - which was you believing everything\n                  was real and the system was serving you and this is the cutting\n                  edge of human evolution and all this nonsense - that vibrational\n                  field is vibrating your state of being out and it will\n                  draw to you people places ways of life experiences etcetera locations which fit your inner self because the outer self\n                  is a projection of the inner self so when you start to transform  this is what happened to\n                  me but i mean it happens to everybody  to another state\n                  of being which then draws to you a very different group of\n                  people places locations ways of life etcetera there is\n                  a transition between the two it does not go one\n                  gone ere you go this one has to break down as this one emerges it is a process of one losing power over your reality another one gaining power it can happen very quickly but\n                  it is not like instant that is actually a very great metaphor for\n                  what is going on in the macrocosm of the planet exactly and in the united states in particular but certainly\n                  england you know all over we can see it here i mean what is\n                  happening here with the economic downturn and with people losing\n                  their houses their shells if you will it changes their lives i could not agree more and the more you resist i think the more destruction\n                  is going to happen the less you resist the quicker the destructive\n                  phase is over and you can actually start climbing back up exactly in your case you were quite extraordinary in the\n                  sense that you had this radical change in your life you went you know from black to white almost there was almost no downtime\n                  for you it sounds like although you said for three months three months was the big downtime but that is extraordinarily quick especially\n                  in the \u201990s today i think this is happening to people\n                  and they are going through a quicker transition and in some\n                  ways there is also a reason for that because you and\n                  people like you have made it easier for those that are following\n                  now to go through the changes i hope so breaking through a veil i hope so i mean i get such satisfaction when\n                  people say that they were helped in understanding what was\n                  going on and you are absolutely right i mean i talk\n                  about this a lot now because between that - the old self and\n                  all that it projects in what we call the physical experience and the new self which projects something else - there is apparent\n                  chaos.relationships breakdown you lose your job you can lose your\n                  house and all this stuff and if you live that as a physical i-am-a-human-body experience then it is very very challenging if you say look this is where i want to go and\n                  you realize that this is the transition to get there then\n                  you can encompass the unpleasant experiences as just that -\n                  an experience - which you are going through to get to\n                  somewhere and quite right the collective there is so many levels to this you know people say\n                  to me sometimes tell me what is going on i\n                  say well first of all i am not the guru but if\n                  you want to know what i think is going on my question is what level of what is going on do you want to talk about because\n                  there is so many ways to observe the same thing so on one level these illuminati bloodlines have crashed\n                  the global economic system because they want to have that as\n                  a problem to which they can offer a solution which is a fiercely\n                  orwellian fascist centralized economic system but on another level i would suggest well beyond their level\n                  of comprehension - because they are stuck in their own\n                  box otherwise they would not be doing what they are\n                  doing - we are witnessing the transition from the prison society\n                  to the paradise society if you like or the freedom society and to go from the system we have had which is based\n                  on control and imposition to the system that we are heading\n                  towards - which is what vibrational change is all about - this has\n                  gotta go and it is now going.kc right if people and it is easy to say this it is\n                  easy to say these apparently trite things when you know you\n                  got a knock on your door saying you are leaving your house\n                  today but if we can hold this level of seeing it it makes\n                  it easier we are going through this process where it is all\n                  breaking down and if we can encompass it as what it is which\n                  is a collective experience to get to where we had like\n                  to go  a world of freedom a world of kindness a world of\n                  love a world of freedom to express your uniqueness rather\n                  than be imprisoned in your tiny version and false identity\n                  of what you are told you are  then it is much easier\n                  than if you seek to cling to the wreckage of the dying system\n                  and hold it together right in some ways you were something of a pioneer where you had to go it alone i imagine you must have much more support now from\n                  everywhere just in the way that kerry is describing than\n                  you did when you really felt you were alone going down the\n                  rapids yes it is funny though because i mean\n                  there are so many things i had like to talk about that\n                  you just brought up because i think it is very very\n                  important i would not say i am a loner but my connection\n                  has always been to that which is driving me and opening doors\n                  and pushing me in this direction and i just follow that so although i was alone in so many ways when it all happened i still had that connection and i still have that connection\n                  now and people are very kind and very supportive but i still\n                  basically just operate in my own little bubble and just go\n                  my own way i do not deal with organizations i do not\n                  connect with other researchers or anything like that i just\n                  follow this impulse but it is easier because there is\n                  more people that are open to what you are saying but you know what you have just brought up is very very important\n                  and you know for me if not the greatest human disease of all\n                  because everything comes out of it i guess is insecurity ironically it was at the height of mass national ridicule that\n                  i found my security because there is that line in that\n                  song i think it was in the \u201960s freedom\u2019s\n                  just another word for nothing left to lose absolutely and you have to look inside for your security you are\n                  not going to get it from anywhere else outside yeah i mean you look at my situation in regard\n                  to that line from that song in the early \u201990s early-mid-\u201990s i was being ridiculed by a nation so i had nothing left to\n                  lose and that is when i found freedom the freedom to\n                  break out of the prisons of fearing what other people think and basically i was laugh laugh but this is me you know i saw a great car sticker i am me and i am free i saw a great car sticker in california - it would\n                  be california - and it said you laugh at me because i am\n                  different i laugh at you because you are all the same kerry\n                  laughs]i do not laugh at people because they are all the\n                  same but it is ironic when this herd mentality is kind of\n                  focusing on one person as it was in britain at that time and you look at them and you think you are laughing\n                  at me my god and so this economic thing that is going and you\n                  know i have been describing it recently as like a controlled\n                  demolition of a building you see the charges go off and then\n                  there is a bizarre split-second before the building goes and then it collapses well in the economic terms of this\n                  crash we are in that bizarre split-second now we have seen nothing yet i mean this is a crash that\n                  no one alive today will have seen it could be compared with\n                  the 1930s but because of the way the world is and there is\n                  more people and the nature of home ownership and all the rest\n                  of it i think it is going to be bigger so people with gardens and independent means of\n                  doing anything at all will be much more interconnected that is the idea you are absolutely right absolutely and so we now face this very situation you are\n                  talking about where we need to reevaluate our and it would\n                  have been a good idea to do it anyway yes our symbols of success right now because insecurity is rampant in people and\n                  society both individually and collectively and on the level\n                  of governments and media and all the rest of it are constantly\n                  getting people to feel insecure most people do not get their\n                  sense of who they are from in-here they get it from what they\n                  think is out-there see it is in their heads absolutely therefore if you are going to attract to you the\n                  recognition you want that you are an ok person to feed\n                  your insecurity you have to succeed out-there on the basis\n                  of the symbols of success that out-there recognizes as success and of course through the media and indoctrination from cradle\n                  to grave it is more money bigger house bigger car fame all this stuff titles and all this business he who dies with the most toys wins yeah so what you have got is the insecurity\n                  itself is - to kind of feed some acknowledgment to lessen its\n                  insecurity - it is chasing these symbols of success that\n                  society has decided is successful and we forget other symbols of success am i happy am\n                    i fulfilled you know do i live in a society a\n                    kind loving society that i had like to live in all this goes by the board because the other thing about needing\n                  to succeed on this manufactured basis to feed this is that\n                  you then have to compete with all the other people that are\n                  trying to succeed in the same way to feed their insecurity right and that creates this \u201cdog eat dog top of\n                  the greasy pole society where everyone\u2019s walking\n                  over everyone else  not everyone but vast numbers of people\n                  are walking over everyone else so that they are the ones\n                  on the top of the pile that get their insecurity fed most profoundly\n                  with the symbols of success this insecurity is why you find some of the most insecure\n                  people you will ever meet in places like hollywood and\n                  in the entertainment industry because their insecurity is such and they are not all like this there are very secure\n                  people who just play music and like to act but there is\n                  a lot of insecure people because they need that extra adulation\n                  to feed their insecurity and so if we can move our point of observation from i\n                    am this body that i see in the mirror in the morning i am\n                    david icke i am charlie smith ethel jones whatever to i am consciousness having an experience then\n                    your values of what is successful change because your point\n                    of observation of everything changes it is the mind working through the body that\n                  deals in status and symbols of success that are how high\n                  is your pile of trinkets whereas consciousness does not\n                  deal in trinkets it knows they are illusory and of\n                  course when you deal in trinkets like that it is the\n                  trinkets controlling you you are not controlling the\n                  trinkets of course and so for me the whole foundation both of coming\n                  through this crash to something much better as the result of\n                  it and the whole transformation in general is moving out\n                  of mind and into what i call consciousness which is that beyond\n                  this virtual reality game beyond this biological computer\n                  we call the body and you can start to see the difference because mind deals\n                  in structure it deals in hierarchy and it deals in apartness it sees everything as apart and polarization yeah and if that is what you are if that is\n                  the way you are seeing life in terms of hierarchal structures apartness and competition and all this stuff you are\n                  in mind ironically the religions are in mind they are\n                  all mind constructs the religions that is why they have\n                  rules and regulations of course that is another massive red light hey mind and that is rules and regulation and laws and limitations limitation a sense of limitation so if we can\n                  change our point of observation so we cease to see ourselves\n                  vitally and the world we think we are living in in those\n                  terms and look at it from a point of view of consciousness i said earlier that this force that is been kind of pushing\n                  me through my last 20 years took me through synchronistic experiences\n                  to understand the five-sense level of the conspiracy then\n                  moved into the interdimensional connection and the reptilian\n                  connection to these families.and since 2003 it is taken me into what i know is by\n                  far the most important and that is understanding the nature\n                  of reality because you know how can you get a grasp of your\n                  own life and take any kind of control of your own experience if you do not know who you are where you are or the\n                  nature of the world you are living in this information for me is by far the most important because\n                  it moves the point of experience from in-this-world to observing-this-world or a mixture of the two and that if you are in-this-world and you are of-this-world then what is coming is going to be a bloody nightmare if\n                  you become the observer as well as the experiencer by becoming\n                  more conscious then it is much easier because that is\n                  not you that is your experience which you are observing\n                  and absolutely this is something that george green\n                  says that he was in contact with the plejarans and that they\n                  helped write a book through him that says that exact thing that you need to stay in the \u201cobserver mode exactly and observe what is going on and not get caught\n                  up in the experience in such a way that actually as you said you become of-this-world instead of in-it-but-not-of-it yeah and what i have found as i am talking\n                  more and more about the reality we live in is it does if\n                  you like take the edge off the fear of what is happening because it is funny really i think that when we find out\n                  everything that is going on and the nature of what we are\n                  experiencing and what is behind it i think we are\n                  going to laugh for weeks i do i think we are going to laugh\n                  for weeks and we thought it was that oh my god the whole thrust of the maze and opening and closing doors\n                  since 2003 for me and it is getting more and more deep and deeper and deeper is what is reality who are we what we are doing here and how do we interact with it and it is very clear to me that this is a virtual reality\n                  universe of enormous advancement compared with what we perceive\n                  to be virtual reality simulations in this world and you know this is not just supposition this is provable scientific fact yes i mean it is so good that we think it is\n                  real yeah you know the five senses just decode vibrational\n                  information into electrical signals send it to the brain and the brain decodes it into this construct that we think\n                  is outside-there but it is actually inside-us the only place this world exists a so-called solid world a three dimensional world is out-there we think but actually\n                  it does not exist out-there out-there is just vibrational\n                  fields it exists in-here as we construct it and even the\n                  brain is a decoded construct as well it is on an energetic\n                  level that we do the decoding really this is very very important because what the manipulators\n                  do because they have hoarded this basic knowledge and\n                  passed it over at the highest level of the secret society network\n                  and sucked it out of public circulation that is right yep they know that if we look out-there for answers believing that there is an out-there instead of an illusory\n                  projection that is going on in-here then we are\n                  never going to change anything yep never we are never going to change anything and once you go ah there is no out-there so where is\n                  it coming from oh it is coming from in-here so this\n                  is where i have to change oh there you go it is what i call  and this is what most people do\n                  because of the suppression of this understanding  is they\n                  stand in the movie theater and they shout at the screen because\n                  they do not like the movie uh huh and people say you are crazy you are\n                    never gonna change the movie shouting at the screen go find\n                    the projection room change the reel if you do not like\n                    the movie and the projection is deep within us you know some research\n                  i saw recently says that only about 5% of behavior and decisions\n                  that we make are with the conscious mind i would actually\n                  say that is not true personally i had say 100% of\n                  what happens in this three-dimensional reality\u2019s only\n                  in our head  actually is a projection the conscious mind is actually not the decision-maker at all it is the observer and experiencer of it and it literally\n                  is the same principle as a movie projector which comes from\n                  within within what we call the subconscious where all those\n                  patterns of air which we are being influenced by and are\n                  affecting our projection and our reading of it and it comes\n                  out of the subconscious by the time it hits the screen in-here symbolically on the movie theater it is a done deal this is where the change has to take place  within us \n                  to change the projection which is our conscious mind\u2019s\n                  experience people are so caught in the conscious mind as that is\n                  the only level i mean you hear them talk about subconscious and all that\n                  stuff but really it is i thought it well how come experiments have shown that the electrical changes\n                  and muscular changes to make an action happen happen a split-second\n                  before the conscious mind has decided to do it it is because they are playing it out and so this\n                  talk about we must go within this new age \u201cmust\n                  go within and there is much about the new age\n                  i would challenge  but this basic theme is absolutely right i would say and what the whole conspiracy\u2019s trying to do is get\n                  us to look out-there let us go and protest let us\n                  go and do this let us go and do that and you protest\n                  and you have a million people on the streets of london protesting\n                  against war and what happens the war goes on and then they\n                  start another bugger it is just more dialectic yeah we need to change the projection this is actually something that we have come\n                  around to and we are aware that consciousness is where\n                  the change has to happen and then consciousness is also where\n                  you have to apply the change in your vision of reality you cannot actually just stop there it actually has\n                  to permeate everything so it needs to be embodied in this\n                  body but we have to talk about who is in control so\n                  if consciousness is in control and i can use this to do for\n                  example what we are doing here which can be used to\n                  further change and push the change and help the change then\n                  this is a good thing but it is not enough in other words just go to in like\n                  buddha and simply sit in your mind and do nothing because\n                  doing nothing is also not the answer we actually came here with a purpose a game is being played\n                  out here and if you stay in the consciousness and you are\n                  able to change your inner self and then mirror it outside and facilitate which is what you are doing obviously and obviously you embody this in your life and what we have\n                  been doing with camelot is we are also talking about you cannot actually demonstrate in the streets and get\n                  real results because it is really you know action reaction it is really that exactly i agree but you can join minds and meditate there\n                  are places for action that are actually really proactive and\n                  can change the world in a positive way it is a very interesting\n                  dilemma for people that they have to actually embody the change\n                  that they seek and live it you know you cannot be a contradiction\n                  to what is inside it does not work there has to\n                  be a through-line well i would put it this way i would say that as i mentioned a few minutes ago that this reality this holographic illusory physical construct which we put together in our heads\n                  is like a holographic internet i call it that is 100% a projection\n                  and by the time it hits the screen it is a done deal\n                  in our experience but a lot of people i have come across and heard they\n                  do think that if you just sit and meditate or just go within then that is all you need to do but this is a projection\n                  and it is a projection from somewhere so this projection\n                  is an open book of the inner-us individually and collectively so what we play out in this experience says everything about\n                  our state of being you can say go within and you can use it as an excuse\n                  to not go without and you can go within and meditate ok so\n                  what is happening in the projection as the result of what\n                  you are doing the only projection that you are affecting\n                  is you sitting cross-legged in the corner what else is changing yes of course you can change things vibrationally to an extent but what is happening in the world is saying what is happening\n                  in us and we have kind of missed that connection so if we are doing nothing to make a contribution to the\n                  kind of world we had like to live in in the physical world then that says something about the state of us within but\n                  we are not doing that right and i see so many excuses being made by people who\n                  have become to a certain extent aware of some of what is\n                  going on so that they can justify to themselves why they are\n                  doing nothing people say to me you do not tell us\n                  what to do and i say well actually i talk about becoming conscious\n                    and all that stuff i think you know that is a start but it are not for me to tell you what to do and if\n                    you think that i have to tell you what to do then you are\n                    not listening because this is about taking power back to\n                    the point where we project rather than looking out-here\n                    at a done deal absolutely there is an active paradox here is not\n                  there because that is not the whole story otherwise\n                  you had be sitting in the corner smiling and not talking\n                  to us here and not working as hard as you do and not talking\n                  to people to help the process of waking them up so that they\n                  can then join you in this understanding which we share with\n                  you also it is important in a sense to pretend that all this\n                  is real because this is the platform from which we can waken\n                  ourselves up and rejoin consciousness again and so it is\n                  a paradox it goes on at both levels what you say is true and this all is an illusion and it all does not matter but it is all important enough for us to be talking about\n                  it what i was saying is in your presentation where\n                  you are talking about consciousness and the mind and the\n                  problems with staying just in mind there is a lot of\n                  brilliant people out there coming to brilliant conclusions and yet they cannot live it you see the manifestation\n                  does not go anywhere yeah it becomes an intellectual academic kind\n                  of point of observation rather than consciousness which is\n                  something that just is the difference that i am now increasingly making is between\n                  mind and consciousness and i would go further and say that\n                  we talk about \u201cmy mind your mind his mind her mind i do not see it like that i talk about the mind the mind is a construct of the virtual reality universe which\n                  allows us - consciousness - to interconnect with this virtual\n                  reality it is like a conduit and there is absolutely\n                  nothing wrong with it whatsoever if it serves the experience\n                  of consciousness and serves our ability to interact with this\n                  virtual reality universe what has happened  and i would strongly suggest it is\n                  been manipulated to happen not least by these families and\n                  other levels of manipulation  is we have been manipulated\n                  into a false identity which is identifying who we are with\n                  mind which operates directly through the body and calls itself \u201cdavid\n                  icke ethel jones charlie smith that\n                  looks in the mirror and thinks that is who it is.basically you know this is a biological computer it is\n                  not a computer that just reacts to the way it is programmed\n                  to react to data input it has the ability to  they call\n                  them living computers  biological computers they are\n                  trying to build them now in different parts of the world it\n                  has the ability to assess information and make decisions on\n                  it in other words to quite a large extent it has the ability\n                  to think.what happens is if we get caught in mind and self-identity\n                  or \u201cthat reflection in the mirror is me and not just my experience then mind starts to govern our\n                  sense of reality and mind is about division apartness hierarchy rules regulations laws limitation and you know you can have someone in the new age arena who\n                  talks about spirituality talks about other dimensions \u2013 which\n                  are other virtual reality games i would suggest - other levels but blatantly is stuck in mind and the values of mind i mean i hear new age people talk about the great white brotherhood\n                  and the hierarchy of the angels and stuff that is mind\n                  talking of course it is consciousness does not do hierarchy it just\n                  is all possibility all that is yep and so the same mind-construct the mind can entrap\n                  a new ager as it entraps in another part of the mind a wall\n                  street banker yeah it is just another religion it is another\n                  religion yeah that is the thing you know i was talking\n                  to on an interview yesterday and we got into some interesting\n                  areas he asked me about religion well religion and the political\n                  party and the new age and all these things that we do not\n                  call \u201creligions institutions - they are\n                  all the same construct right because consciousness just is consciousness does not\n                  think consciousness knows that is why consciousness\n                  is silent when we access it because it is got nothing\n                  to work out the mind is where the chatter comes from because it is\n                  constantly trying to work things out what\n                  about yesterday what\u2019d she say about me more\n                  chattering sounds] silence  consciousness so to hold you in mind and this\n                  conspiracy is about holding the population in mind because\n                  then they gotcha absolutely because that is their stadium \u2013 mind they are stuck in mind if they were conscious they would not\n                  do what they are doing to hold us in mind they have\n                  to sell us something to rigidly believe in so religions brilliant example of rigid belief and what\n                  is it once you rigidly believe something you then call it\n                  a name what are you you do not say i am\n                    consciousness how many people say hello who are\n                    you i am consciousness oh so am i nice to meet you no-no what we are is what we do i am a journalist i work in a factory what are you i am a hindu i am a christian these are mind-constructs these are mind-prisons that limit\n                  our sense of self so once you have a rigid belief then you\n                  give it a name now i have a simple philosophy about all this if you can\n                  tell me what you believe and give it a name you are in\n                  a prison because everything just is we all just are it is \u201cthe force with no name i call it\n                   consciousness and so you create religion and then after the name then comes\n                  the rules and regulations  this is how the construct goes\n                   of what you have to conform to if you are going to be allowed\n                  to call yourself whatever name that is been come up with you are\n                  not a christian if you believe that and all this stuff.then you look at political parties you have a group of people they get together and they want to do something politically so they give what they are doing a name democrats republicans labor party conservative party whatever so there is\n                  the name.now come the rules and regulations that decide if you can\n                  call yourself one or the other you cannot believe\n                  that and be a conservative you cannot believe that and\n                  be a liberal it is the same construct wherever\n                  you look yes and then the belief system as research has shown rigid beliefs the neurons fire off in a certain network and\n                  sequence in line with the belief because what the brain\u2019s\n                  doing is then filtering decoding reality and circumstance through the\n                  belief system which manifests in the brain as the way the\n                  neurons fire off and suddenly instead of being free-thinking or even better free-knowing - conscious - you are operating in a tiny little\n                  box and that box is basically the way your not basically it is the way your brain decodes reality.so once you are into belief a rigid belief then they\n                  gotcha and that is why they want to sell you rigid beliefs yes absolutely there is an active paradox here is not\n                  there because that is not the whole story otherwise you had be sitting in the corner smiling and not talking\n                  to us here and not working as hard as you do and not talking\n                  to people to help the process of waking them up so that they\n                  can then join you in this understanding which we share with\n                  you also it is important in a sense to pretend that\n                  all this is real because this is the platform from which we\n                  can waken ourselves up and rejoin consciousness again and\n                  so it is a paradox it goes on at both levels what you\n                  say is true and this all is an illusion and it all does not\n                  matter but it is all important enough for us to be talking\n                  about it it matches bill in the sense\n                  that do we want to experience a reality that is very very unpleasant and controlling and limiting and frightening and stressful or do we want to experience a reality that is loving kind where no-one goes hungry in a world of plenty where there\n                  is no war because no-one would even consider the idea that\n                  it was a possibility or an option that is the choice we are making we are always\n                  consciousness and when we leave the body we will become\n                  at least much more aware of everything than we are now.so we are always conscious we are all eternal consciousness but the question is what kind of experience do we want\n                  here exactly you know that is the choice we call it what kind of game do you want to\n                    play yeah we have a chance now because we are consciousness to change the rules of the game to make it something different\n                  than it is change inside but let us also agree because that is what is happening that is what\n                  a consciousness revolution has to be about it is not good enough for you david icke to have got\n                  it it is not good enough for us to have got it what\n                  we need is for everyone to get it to tune this game here on\n                  this plane because that is what it is really about in other words consciousness and this is where it gets\n                  into what is consciousness it is love and what\n                  is love it is actually the awareness of all of us hmm well i would say everything is consciousness mind is consciousness but it is a much denser expression\n                  of consciousness and that is why it sees everything in\n                  terms of limitation and as people become conscious it can - to use the term of\n                  a friend of mine in south africa - consciousness can \u201cconscientize mind\n                  and bring its awareness out of the level that it currently\n                  perceives reality.but i do think it is important that if we are going to\n                  play this game successfully that we understand where the game\u2019s\n                  being played it is not being played out-there.see what the five senses are doing like i said earlier is that they are decoding vibrational information turning\n                  it into electric signals the brain then constructs this apparent\n                  reality out-there which actually is only in-here.so the prime reality is vibrational that is the prime\n                  reality that is where the change has to take place because\n                  as the change takes place there the five senses decode different\n                  vibrational states into electrical signals there is that wonderful story told by michael\n                  talbot in the holographic universe yeah and i read that page over and over again when i\n                  first saw that book in the late 1980s this is the story about\n                  the stage hypnotist who hypnotized the father to believe that\n                  his daughter was invisible and then he was able to read an\n                  inscription on the watch held behind her body because for\n                  him she was no longer there and reality had changed it was\n                  physically different in his mind well this is the whole point you see for a hypnotist\n                  to put a watch behind someone\u2019s back and someone the\n                  other side of it read it that is perceived to be impossible but it is only impossible if you believe this world to\n                  be solid and real and out-there.the reason it could happen is because the prime reality \n                  and i cannot emphasize this more  the prime reality\n                  that is playing out here is vibrational that has\n                  to change or this cannot change.and so if the hypnotist as he did implanted the program\n                  into the guy\u2019s brain not to decode the vibrational level the prime level of his daughter through this system into a\n                  holographic so-called physical form that we see then he would\n                  decode all the other vibrational fields in the room into people\n                  and walls and furniture but because it is like a computer being fire-walled off he does not decode the daughter\u2019s prime state \n                  your prime state our prime state the prime state of everything this vibrational level  into the holographic apparently\n                  out-there reality and so she does not exist in his head as a holographic\n                  form i.e supposedly physical so he cannot see her because she is not there he can see what is behind\n                  her therefore he can read a watch even though she is\n                  standing there to everyone else in the room they can see her why because their brain has not been programmed not to read\n                  that energy field into a holographic form.now just as a quick aside how many things collectively are we not reading that are there to be read well one of the things is there is more than\n                  five senses ok and the heart is it is not just the\n                  mind it is actually the heart it is really the\n                  heart and the intelligence of the heart that you can see through\n                  if we had only use that so it is more than in other words these are tools for us our mind is a tool our heart is a tool but you cannot stay up here gesturing\n                  to head] you have actually gotta go through the heart to\n                  really see see we do not see with our eyes that is\n                  actually that is a construct that is a mental\n                  construct yeah we see with our brain we actually see with our heart more than anything\n                  else and through the heart and so what happens is it is\n                  a union between the mind and the heart i agree that allows you to see and you could put yourself\n                  in that man\u2019s position and say how could the man\n                  see through the implant that was put into his brain first of all what did he do he had to accept the magician\u2019s you know implant to begin with so in the same way we in\n                  society are accepting the implant whether it is television\n                  or whatever which is blocking our real view of reality we are\n                  accepting it yeah i mean the thing is though that what the\n                  hypnotist was doing was just programming the decoding mechanism yes and therefore he did not decode a vibrational\n                  field i.e his daughter into a holographic form therefore\n                  he did not see her and i completely agree that the heart has the potential to\n                  be a massive part of our reality-decoding our reality-expression but we also have to appreciate that this conspiracy while\n                  we see the george bushes of the world and the barack obamas\n                  and people like that the kissingers the real level of this\n                  conspiracy where the world is being controlled is on a vibrational\n                  level that is why i talk about these reptilians that are doing\n                  this and others too operating outside this reality they\n                  operate on a level of the vibrational level that is where\n                  the manipulation\u2019s going on yep and we need to be you know kind to ourselves as\n                  well in understanding the challenges that we face and not\n                  least trying to understand a world that is being manipulated\n                  into a state or has been manipulated into a state which has\n                  just stopped us understanding the world and so you know we look at television and the manipulation\n                  of television and newspapers and stuff but when we see a newspaper\n                  or we see a television program we are just seeing the\n                  decoded version of a vibrational field those newspapers and those television programs and news programs all the rest of it they are actually \u201cphysical holographic\n                  representations of the prime reality which is a vibrational\n                  field yeah yes it is at that level that that manipulation\n                  we call \u201csubliminal that manipulation we call \u201clying\n                  to the people and all the rest of it actually happens and so basically what they have done is pull a vibrational\n                  veil over us if you can make it powerful enough and dense\n                  enough you focus peoples sense of perception into such\n                  a narrow area that they disconnect from an awareness and therefore\n                  a deep effect in their perception of consciousness you are isolating their point of observation into mind and that is happening on a vibrational level which then\n                  plays out in what we call the physical world yes so what is vital - and this is why this information\n                  is so important - not just i will tell you what i have\n                  found nothing represents literally and symbolically the prison\n                   than the left brain which deals in apartness language hierarchy structure and all this stuff and the information about the five-sense conspiracy i have\n                  found one of its great values is that it operates in a left-brain\n                  realm when you are explaining how this and that and the\n                  other is connected to the same people and they control that and this is what they are doing and these are the techniques\n                  they use that is left-brain information oh yeah yes and when people say oh you should not\n                    put out that information it is negative they\n                    do not understand that we are looking at a multi-level\n                    situation therefore we have to deal with it on a multi-level\n                    basis that means covering all bases not just sitting cross-legged\n                    on a mountain of course now what i have found over the years is that\n                  once the left brain because symbolically i see you know you have got the left brain which is what i am talking\n                  about you have got the right brain which is a much more\n                  out-there connection and sees everything in unity the creative\n                  urge.then you have got the bridge the corpus callosum which ideally should be sharing information so you have\n                  got a balance you are in this world and of it you know.but what the conspiracy does  again it is all on a\n                  vibrational level that it goes in and then it plays out here\n                   is they put symbolically soldiers on the door to the left\n                  brain this is why to progress within this society one of the most\n                  effective ways is to keep passing exams and passing exams and getting degrees and all this stuff because that is an exam is here\u2019s some left-brain information now\n                  give it me back on a paper telling me what i have told\n                  you to believe ok you have done it very well you have\n                  got a first-class degree a first-class indoctrination often.now what this conspiracy information on a five-sense level\n                  does it talks to the left brain in the language the left brain\n                  understands and i have seen it over the time in my personal\n                  experience and of course other people would have seen it it starts to make the left brain change its sense of reality.once it starts to change that it starts to think well hold on a second if everything i thought about the world\n                    here was wrong and it is not like that at all what\n                    the heck else is in this world is not like i thought it was i have seen this where people once that left brain starts\n                  this process of withdrawing from a sense of \u201cit knows\n                  what is going on to \u201ci never knew then\n                  it starts to move as it starts to move it literally starts\n                  to open to other possibility and then this movement between\n                  the hemispheres can start to happen.i have seen people who would have laughed in my face about\n                  reality and all that stuff who now encompass it because they\n                  went through the process of credible names dates places five-sense information explaining logically why the world\n                  is not like they thought it was on a five-sense level everything\n                  starts to move then.so you know it is important that the de-programming\n                  of peoples manipulated sense of reality happens on multi\n                  levels not just kind of you know we must become\n                  spiritual we must go within you know i mean people say oh alex jones he just frightens\n                    people and all that well hold on a second you know just hold on a second you know what is negative it is not information it is ignorance that is what is negative \n                  ignorance and if you want to be ignorant and therefore a\n                  manipulator\u2019s party trick then you go ahead and if you want to look at the information the five-sense\n                  information that i put out and alex puts out and people like\n                  that and many others and say it is negative it is\n                  frightening well the fact that you find it frightening instead of empowering\n                  because you now understand the game better and therefore you\n                  have more power to do something about it then that is not\n                  a statement about those putting the information out it is\n                  a statement about the way you are receiving it exactly something that we like very much was something\n                  that george green said to us in our interview with us april\n                  of last year he used this little analogy he said listen if your car is on the railroad track and there is a train coming down and you do not\n                    know that and i do not tell you then it is shame\n                    on me for not telling you and shame on you for not knowing and\n                    this is just a nice little way of encapsulating what you are\n                    saying yeah i have an analogy i use very similar to that i talk about the - not the hurricane coming what do you\n                  call them the twisters the tornadoes the tornadoes yeah and the tornado\u2019s coming\n                  but you have put your head in a bucket of sand because you\n                  do not want to face the fact that the tornado\u2019s\n                  coming now you can hide from that for a while but you are\n                  still there and the tornado\u2019s still coming and your\n                  bum is still in the air and it is gonna get smacked very\n                  shortly by a tornado if you lift your head from the sand face the situation that\n                  you are in  there is a tornado coming  now you\n                  have taken power back to yourself by saying ok i see\n                  the situation now i can take avoiding action for my benefit of course and this is why it is so important you know i hear people who you might new age who talk about \u201cletting\n                  go of fear and \u201ctaking your power back and \u201ccome\n                  to this workshop and we will show you how to do it and then they say oh you must not talk about this\n                    conspiracy it is too negative what happened to\n                    letting go of fear and all this stuff you know these are the guys who heard that\n                  the angel gabriel is going to come and save us you know that\n                  does not work either every level it seems to me every belief system every mind construct seems to have a version of the cavalry\n                  coming over the horizon you know ok here\u2019s the\n                  cavalry ok here\u2019s the cavalry here\u2019s the cavalry there is the cavalry and we need to understand that you know because if we give\n                  our power away to other people where do those other people\n                  actually where do they actually stand physically as we\n                  give our power away to them?out-there symbolically so what we are doing is giving\n                  the power away into the illusion and then wondering why nothing\n                  ever changes.the whole conspiracy or the foundation of the conspiracy is to persuade 6 billion people to give their power away every\n                  day and the power used to control us is the power of these\n                  people saying thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much take it back house of cards comes down because that is\n                  what it is it is a house of cards and we are holding\n                  it together in-here we are constructing the house of\n                  cards in-here great news we can bring it down in-here right but i have to say that we are\n                  not only going to do that with the mind that is what is\n                  really important here no the mind plays it out we are\n                  going to do it by becoming conscious that is the point absolutely but also left brain right brain i\n                  want to address that a little bit right because it is not enough to reconstruct reality\n                  based on things getting to a place where you do not know and then you are willing to open to a new construction\n                  of reality such that you are going to play the game different but you are still lodged in the left brain you must bring in the holistic view the view that encompasses\n                  the heart that encompasses the female which is the yin-yang\n                  side of things because what we have here has been playing\n                  out for centuries is a really yang view of reality especially on the western side of the world well kind of i had say it slightly differently so what i have to say is it is more than just\n                  reconstructing the left brain in a new way to play the game\n                  better because that is actually cheating yourself on\n                  another level you need to grow and open the door between the left and the\n                  right brain such that there is a flow and that means that\n                  you are talking about the heart you are talking\n                  about senses that are beyond the five and so you have to what you had to do in your own exploration was you never\n                  would have gotten the information you wanted to get by staying\n                  in the left brain as you said you had physical sensations they locked your feet they gave you information that came\n                  out of nowhere you could not make logical sense of it logic was out the window so left brain\u2019s gone you know it is even worse or useless when you get into that place i agree so you must actually it is like traveling in a sense you must actually travel to a different place what you do  is you follow your intuition right you are over on your i guess they call it\n                  the right side of the brain that is where you are that is\n                  where intuition resides so you have opened that door there is a flow and that is really what has to happen well yeah i mean i take my intuition which has\n                  guided me and has lead me to information also it is like\n                  a filter i have a vibrational sensation when something is\n                  not true and something is true and another one when it is\n                  maybe partly true that is holistic yeah the left brain\u2019s still important in\n                  bringing those concepts down into a language of communication\n                  that people can assimilate that are stuck in the left brain because if you do not talk in logical  from their perspective logical terms that the left brain can understand which is\n                  under lock and key  then that key will never open.and that is also why what you have just said that you\n                  will except on rare occasions when i am talking in\n                  a very small time-scale or doing an interview on a specific\n                  subject i will never talk about the five-sense conspiracy\n                  without the nature of reality and the influence of consciousness and all the rest of it.another point you make is about the heart i agree the heart\n                  is absolutely at the heart of this and is much more powerful\n                  than the brain and much more powerful than the mind because\n                  it is connected i would say that is what connects us\n                  through the consciousness.and this conspiracy also because you know it is\n                  a simple thing in the deep shadows behind the people in dark\n                  suits is a force whatever you want to call it that understands\n                  how this works right so they have structured a society that is to\n                  close down all the channels to consciousness to isolate us\n                  in mind because then we are playing in their stadium and one of the key things they use is to close the heart to\n                  close the heart and if you want to open the heart and you want to become conscious\n                   it is what i say in my talks  then what we need to\n                  do is to ask the question what would consciousness do\n                  at this point would consciousness when we are faced with this set\n                  of circumstances say well what is the best outcome\n                  for me no consciousness would say what is the right just fair thing in this situation for me to do and if we when we are faced with choices all through\n                  the day ask that question in this circumstance what\n                  would consciousness do and act upon it \u2013 crucially\n                   then everything changes and our life changes why because we are now starting to resonate with consciousness\n                  because we are operating in its realm which is by\n                  doing what we say consciousness would do in these circumstances we are vibrationally locking in to that level and therefore\n                  becoming more and more influenced by consciousness.when we say well yeah i see that but it is not\n                    good for me if i do what is right in this situation i must do what is right for me that is mind so that is locking you into mind you know this thing about becoming conscious i see it\n                  so often all over the world i mean i was in india just before\n                  christmas and you know good luck to them but they make\n                  it sound so complicated and you know a lot of the complication i see this with new\n                  age people that stand on stages and do workshops not all of\n                  them of course i see it with gurus in india and stuff like\n                  that not all of them again but vast numbers of them the complexity says two things one they do not really\n                  understand it because if you really understand something you can put it in simple language i had agree with that this is why you get academia repeating jargon and\n                  you say look i am an idiot mate ok i have\n                  never passed an exam in me life i left school at 15 to be a\n                  professional soccer player you are gonna have to put\n                  it in language i can understand they cannot because\n                  they do not really understand it they are just repeating\n                  jargon and the other side of the complexity of becoming conscious\n                  is if you can make it sound complex then you have taken\n                  power over your potential audience that is a big thing absolutely it is still a power game you have to come through me and the more i\n                    make it sound complex the more power i have and therefore\n                    the more you must come to me and the longer you must stay\n                    with me and by the way put the check in the box as you\n                    leave and yet it is so simple this is the point i would make people\n                  talk about \u201cwe must become conscious it is\n                  a lie we are conscious that is our natural state what is\n                  happened is barriers that we have been manipulated  and\n                  we must take responsibility for it too big time  are put in place have symbolically created a concrete\n                  shell around our natural state and in this concrete shell\n                  are all the things that control people  fear and stress and conflict and seeking success and competition and all\n                  this stuff it is not that we have to become conscious we are conscious it is breaking that shell and that shell is mind domination if we can break that shell we become conscious it is like the lie that is in language\n                  when people say my spirit my soul and i am\n                  hungry it is like wait a minute this is the wrong\n                  way around here you know i have a body and my body is\n                  hungry my body is tired and i am a soul and i am a\n                  spirit that language which is a product of the mind in the first\n                  place because we do not think how we do not talk\n                  how we think we think how we talk and language is one of\n                  the ways in which we are programmed a massive massive way as george orwell pointed out in 1984 programming the computer but what are words they are\n                  vibrational fields so again even the words the programmers\n                  are actually coming in at a vibrational level a waveform level and they are only decoded into language when they pass\n                  though the brain construct that is true so everything gets in that plays out-here gets\n                  in at vibrational level that is why we need to get to\n                  that level of ourselves and clear ourselves out because that is\n                  where all the patterns are put in.and i use this analogy in my talks that you know a ball its natural place in a tank of water is on the top just floating\n                  away it is a natural state free going like if you want to put the ball in an unnatural state in the tank you have gotta put in on the bottom of the tank and you have\n                  gotta hold it there you cannot put it there and it will\n                  stay there because it is not its natural state its natural\n                  state is floating on the top our natural state is being conscious.so what their manipulation has had to do is  and this says\n                  something about the true scale of who we are  it has had\n                  to bombard us with so many multi-level systems of control diversion and manufactured ignorance to symbolically hold\n                  the ball on the bottom and it has not succeeded actually they are mounting these systems\n                  of control that is what the move towards a fascist state\n                  and a world government is all about i actually heard an interview with you in which you talked\n                  about that fact you see the fact that we are - to use your\n                  analogy which is a very good one - we are consciousness and\n                  as that ball we are moving as a group towards the surface of\n                  the water we are actually getting out of their grasp right as that happens they are intensifying their\n                  game to want to keep that ball down and so that is why\n                  the stakes are rising on both sides could not agree more and what is going to happen is look at the\n                  natural i mean even the metaphor is perfect because what is\n                  going to happen ultimately the water and the ball are going to win ok there is no way that those forces as much as they\n                  intensify sometime somewhere that ball is going to get to the\n                  surface like it or not the powers that be yeah now what is going to be interesting is if they\n                  actually start understanding on a deeper level than power and\n                  their power-over because \u201ci have got the clue and \u201ci have\n                  got the key that is what the illuminati you know that is what they think they think if you do not get it then we can hold\n                    you down you deserve to be held down that is\n                    actually their i am sure you know this this is their\n                    rationale so what happens when we because we are greater than\n                  our bodies the consciousness that we are is greater than\n                  what they are because they are on limitation start to\n                  win in their own mind you see and they start to let go because this is what is probably happening there have\n                  to be many members that have been under the thumb of this game\n                  and have joined and are being you know will be patted on\n                  the head and given all the reinforcement necessary to keep\n                  them in the game what happens when they start to see the light so to speak and some of them i am sure already are because\n                  there is nothing more fiercely compartmentalized than\n                  this whole control structure itself there is so many people within the control structure right down into mainstream society that are daily contributing\n                  to this gathering fascist global state who have no idea of\n                  the true implications of it or as they go up higher and higher have been mislead about the nature of themselves reality and the force behind it so the nature of the chaos and the destruction will\n                  actually work in the favor of releasing the ball because what\n                  happens is during chaos you can change sides you see you\n                  can actually you know it is really hard to maintain\n                  control during a time of destruction yeah i agree what i would say is that the ball\n                  will get to the top of the water when the ball realizes that\n                  it is the water and the scale of the movement and the speed of movement of\n                  this conspiracy now as it puts in more and more surveillance more and more control more and more centralization of power etcetera i have been saying for years now that is not\n                  about even gathering more power it is about defending the\n                  control that is already there because they understand i mean if i can go to a psychic in england in 1990 to be\n                  told through this psychic that this vibrational change was\n                  coming was going to create a spiritual revolution i mean are the illuminati families not going to know that this spiritual\n                  change this vibrational alarm clock is coming of course they\n                  are and they have known about it for a long time and so what we are looking at is a i mean when you\n                  lose the power  from \u201cwe are in control and\n                  we are going to get more power to \u201cwe\n                  must impose more and more control to stop this happening they are\n                  not in a if you like a pro-active situation now as they push\n                  this orwellian state on they are in a defensive situation trying to keep the\n                  lid on human ignorance as this vibrational change brings it\n                  to the surface yeah and you know compared with consciousness this\n                  illuminati i mean they are flies on an elephant\u2019s\n                  back you know and they are gonna get removed i think it is not about winning the game and it is\n                  not about losing the game it is about realizing the nature\n                  of the game and the fact that it is not about winning\n                  and losing it is just about experiencing and as these pyramids of control certainly the lower levels\n                  first start getting picked off by this vibrational change and people start to see things differently you know as i have been saying for 20 years look at a pyramid the\n                    capstone\u2019s the place of the power no it is\n                    not the capstone\u2019s up there because the rest of the\n                    pyramid\u2019s holding the bugger up there the rest of\n                    the pyramid moves away where is the capstone gonna\n                    go it is gonna crash to the floor there is nothing\n                    holding it up we are holding up the structure that is our\n                    own control system i used to tell a story years ago you will remember bill larry\n                  grayson a comedian in the uk right yes i knew larry towards the end of his life he used\n                  to do big shows on the bbc and i was invited to his memorial\n                  service at covent garden after he died there is another comedian in britain called roy hudd and he did this presentation about larry\u2019s life he told\n                  this story and i sat there and i felt whoooo that is\n                  so profound when applied to what we are talking about roy hudd said that larry grayson had told him this story that in the days of music hall-type theater or the last vestiges\n                  of it larry was in an all-male show going around britain and he was the woman in it because he used to dress up as\n                  a woman larry the final scene of the show or the final part of the show was all the men ran on the stage dressed as sailors singing rule\n                  britannia you know rule britannia britannia\n                  rules the waves and all that stuff you know britain\n                  has to rule everything anyway so as this song\u2019s reaching its climax all these\n                  sailors climb on each other\u2019s backs and form a pyramid\n                  on the stage right and then larry grayson came on dressed\n                  as britannia with the gown and the helmet and the sword and\n                  was manhandled up to the top of the pyramid of these men you\n                  know the big finish with the sword and he said one night things seemed to be going rather well he said until one of the sailors in the bottom left-hand corner\n                  got a cough right and the cough got worse and worse and worse\n                  until he could not hold his place in the pyramid anymore and he is standing on the stage at the bottom of the pyramid this guy you know ethel jones and charlie smith and in the end he could not hold it anymore because the\n                  cough got too bad and he had to step out of the pyramid what\n                  happened was larry grayson at the top symbolic of this illuminati ended up in the second row  because the whole\n                  pyramid collapsed because one little guy on the left-hand bottom\n                  corner got a cough yes lovely you know pyramid power in one way is all roads\n                  from the base of the pyramid lead up to the point of the pyramid and that is how they control the thing that i would like to connect up with here it is so interesting what you are saying and we passionately\n                  agree with your thesis here and one of the things which i\n                  love about your work is that it is like in order to control rather one good way to control somebody is to lie to them and therefore if you are being lied to and someone is\n                  trying to control you these things are intimately connected right and we are being convinced that this reality is\n                  all that there is that these are just animated hunks of meat\n                  that last three score years and ten and then that is\n                  our lot and then either we are pushing up daisies or\n                  we go to heaven or go to hell which is another trap and another\n                  lie absolutely and meanwhile there is some fascinating things\n                  going on behind the scenes and as you must have known from\n                  your own research and your own contacts and your own conversations\n                  that you have got a magical component to the controllers\n                   meant in the real definition of the word magic \n                  black magic ceremonies rituals sacrifices all kinds of things\n                  that you and i do not want to know about but actually\n                  this is part of the truth of the matter this is what they\n                  do they evoke djinns they do strange things yeah i was getting an enormous amount of stuff\n                  about that in the late \u201990s and it is not pleasant to look at and it is\n                  real and then there is another aspect to this which\n                  is something that is been coming at us quite a lot from\n                  black projects insiders which is not the black magic but\n                  the black technology which was well stated by richard hoagland who told us that he had had a phone call from an insider\n                  who said that \u201cthey would rather lose an american\n                  city than give up their new physics and this new physics we were told by somebody who we met\n                  in thailand in october we have given him the pseudonym\n                  of jake simpson we know the guy very well he said that the\n                  state of black physics at the moment is when i say black\n                  physics it is like secret physics as in black operations yeah those guys are not all evil people but they are\n                  on the inside and they are playing these games with all\n                  the resources and all the knowledge that is denied the public\n                  domain right ten thousand years ahead of public\n                  sector physics they say accelerating away from public sector\n                  knowledge at the rate of 1000 years a year i checked those\n                  figures with him that is a lot of zeroes ten thousand\n                  years ahead and he told us for instance that the technology\n                  exists to phase-shift soldiers special forces soldiers so\n                  that they can walk through walls i have heard that a few years ago you have heard that yeah that is yeah it is an interesting\n                  corroboration these little stories pop up here and there in\n                  different researchers i think the thing is bill that the reason for\n                  the fast acceleration is there is a critical point where\n                  you understand reality and from that point the potential just\n                  absolutely soars whereas because of the suppression of science\n                  in the public arena they are nowhere near yet that\n                  line where the potential soars so in the secret projects they have crossed that line\n                  and therefore they are accelerating away at the rate\n                  you talk about from mainstream scientific understanding that is exactly right and there is other dimensional intelligences\n                  who have gotten to that point absolutely right it is really a key and ets  negative you\n                  know service-to-self ets basically  that they are\n                  working with and certainly becoming aware of the veil behind\n                  the veil because you can talk about consciousness and mind as we have\n                  here but if you want to lay out you know if you want to\n                  understand what is really going on you do have to talk\n                  about ets and you have to talk about interdimensional entities\n                  and also sure entities that do not have physical bodies sure that is what i was saying earlier we have\n                  got to do this on all levels because it is operating on\n                  all levels the best presentation which i heard of the answer\n                  to one of the most important questions  and i cannot\n                  remember whether it was yourself or jordan maxwell or perhaps\n                  both who said how could humans do the things that they do to other humans\n                    on this planet as they seem to really be doing how could\n                    we be trashing this planet our home in the way that we\n                    are at the behest of the controllers how could humans be\n                    doing this and the answer is that actually they are not human at\n                  the highest level is this something that you said or was that jordan maxwell that is the thing that i have been talking\n                  about for a while because you know this reality we keeping\n                  talking about different levels this reality obviously operates\n                  on different levels you have got the wave vibrational\n                  level you have got the electromagnetic level you have\n                  got the visible light level and you have got the digital\n                  level and when you talk about the level of advancement and potential\n                  that you mentioned earlier it is a cinch to if you look\n                  at where the development of artificial intelligence is moving\n                  now within this stone age level of awareness imagine what\n                  is possible at the cutting edge of the secret projects and\n                  even beyond that in the realms of the non-human levels of\n                  this they have without question the ability to create artificial\n                  intelligence that looks to our in the decoded world because\n                  i am decoding you now what you are is a vibrational field so if you can create a vibrational field with artificial intelligence\n                  that is vibrating externally in the same form range that\n                  a human body is this basically it is a biological\n                  computer human body but what is animating it is different\n                  to what animates ours then i am going to decode you or i am\n                  going to decode this artificial intelligence just like the lady\n                  in the red dress in the matrix movie exactly and she is going to look just like you and me i remember being in that ayahuasca state in 2003 and\n                  that female voice said to me if you programmed a computer\n                  to abuse a child would the computer have any emotional consequence\n                  for that any emotional reaction none it would just\n                  do what it is programmed to do.and one of the most blatant things about these illuminati\n                  bloodlines is they have no empathy they have no ability to\n                  empathize with the consequences for others of their actions that is why there are no limits you know pepper-bombing\n                  baghdad to us horrific terrific emotional consequence to\n                  them nothing just like a computer and they are like computers and to a large extent that is\n                  why some of them are so bright you know my computer on my\n                  desk can work things out quicker than i can in some areas where it is just you know working out to a program it has no wisdom it has no empathy it has no heart or consciousness but on a mental level it can work very quickly and these people are very sharp mentally there is no\n                  doubt about it some of these people are very sharp mentally but they have no heart no balancing qualities of consciousness.i am convinced they are artificial intelligence when i look at someone like kissinger i mean i see an artificial\n                  intelligence that has been created by a very very advanced\n                  knowledge and it looks just like you and me because that is\n                  the way we decode it you know.and you know again bill when you were talking about their\n                  rituals and what have you what are the rituals doing it is\n                  all about creating a vibrational field they are creating\n                  an energetic environment that allows these interdimensional\n                  entities to move into this dimension at least briefly and\n                  what they are also doing is accessing through these rituals\n                  the vibrational level of reality which is the prime level\n                  of reality which we decode into this so what they are doing on one level with these rituals\n                   which they often do at vortex points which are very powerful\n                  in affecting the vibrational state of the planet the communication\n                  lines like meridian lines that we have in the body the planet\n                  has if they do a ritual where a lot of these lines meet then\n                  the vibrational effect of that ritual is going out down these\n                  lines and they are affecting us because we are being\n                  affected by that vibrational level that prime level so i have\n                  no doubt at all they have got technology too that is\n                  creating disharmony within the vibrational level of this reality which then will create disharmony here you know and the thing is though i remember that scene in the\n                    matrix - because people read things in different ways i read neo\u2019s journey as becoming conscious i think\n                    that is probably what they meant but that is the\n                    way i read it very powerfully there was a point where he is in a simulation with the\n                  morpheus character and morpheus is explaining about the agents now for agents read people that you are\n                  talking about that have the ability to do incredible things\n                  within this reality because they understand how it works\n                  and they keep it from the people right and people who have watched the matrix will\n                  remember the scene because the agent agent smith is in freeze-frame\n                  in this thing with a gun and the morpheus character says\n                  to neo people have emptied entire clips at them and hit\n                  nothing but air but their strength and their speed is still\n                  based on a world based on rules and because of that they\n                  can never be as fast or as strong as you can be right because within this virtual reality there are rules\n                  to the game some of them are called laws of physics and such\n                  like consciousness overcomes those laws does not recognize\n                  them is not entrapped by them so as we become conscious we move beyond the box that the controlling force is actually\n                  in.during my talks i put two boxes one\u2019s got symbolically a reptilian on it on a smaller one it is got humans on\n                  it what they have done and the whole foundation of how\n                  it is been possible because they are in a box otherwise they would not be doing what they are\n                  doing absolutely and if they are artificial intelligence they are\n                  obviously in a box with a lid on that does not open but\n                  they manage to control human society by putting humans in a\n                  smaller box than they are in again we come back symbolic of the box they are holding\n                  the ball on the bottom of the tank as we become conscious we go beyond their potential and that is what they are\n                  terrified of let me tell the story about bill birnes and admiral\n                  george hoover i do not know if you have heard this\n                  one but we had love to tell this one on camera ok bill birnes los angeles-based editor of ufo\n                    magazine talked to admiral george hoover from the office\n                    of naval intelligence before he died when he was an elderly\n                    man he had one of these turn-around experiences when he\n                    was very old and he started to talk to bill birnes about\n                    what was really going on bill birnes wanted to know about things like the roswell crash all of this stuff and one of the things that george hoover\n                  told bill birnes was that the roswell crash the visitors there they were time travelers they were us from the future time-traveling\n                  future humans which we\u2018ve heard from other sources as\n                  well the most important thing though the biggest secret was\n                  how powerful we are the consciousness we have the ability\n                  that we have and bill birnes words from george hoover\n                  were our ability to manipulate the consciousness around us and if we started to do that as far as the controllers were\n                  concerned we would create havoc and this is what must not be known it must not be known how\n                  powerful we are because the time-traveling future humans used\n                  their consciousness in order to bridge these dimensions what these disks are according to hoover and also according\n                  to philip corso who wrote the day after roswell is that they are sort of like amplifiers and focusing devices\n                  of consciousness and the pilots are an integral part of the\n                  machine and as any quantum physicist will tell you it is consciousness\n                  that actually has the ability to determine whether schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\n                  cat is alive or dead to determine probabilistic quantum outcomes to actually influence reality you cannot do quantum physics\n                  without taking account of consciousness therefore this means if you have a very high control an ability\n                  in that realm it sort of bridges mind and consciousness then just as great adepts are said to be able to do you can bi-locate so ok so we will do it all together we will do it in\n                  a craft it will help us it will amplify us and this is what the crafts are and this is why they were\n                  baffled when they opened up these things they could not\n                  find an engine that female voice in the ayahuasca experiences\n                  said to me why do you fly in a plane when you are\n                  only flying through yourself exactly and what came to mind when you were talking there bill was the carry-on of that scene in the matrix with\n                  agent smith where he is saying he will never\n                  be as strong and fast as you can be and then the neo character says do you mean i will\n                    be able to dodge bullets no neo when you are ready you will not have\n                    to controlling your experience you know you do not have\n                  to dodge bullets you are going to make sure no-one ever\n                  shoots at you you are not in a position where you have to\n                  dodge bullets yeah and you know people have said to me so many\n                  times over the years right from the early days why are not\n                  you dead and it may sound you know i can only say\n                  what i know deep inside they cannot they cannot they cannot they cannot they cannot.if we were coming to do something and all it took was someone\n                  to shoot a bullet and it is all over what is the\n                  point they cannot.what i would say very strongly and it is coming more\n                  and more into my life there is an x-factor which i do not\n                  understand yet but i sure as hell know it is there and\n                  it is an x-factor which is going to bring an end to this\n                  childish playground nonsense of human control do you mean an external influence there is something something i absolutely at a deep level i know it and whenever i think about it whenever i have been clear about what i am talking\n                  about now what i see clearly is the planet with a cell prison\n                  around it and a big lock and a key going in and i will tell you a funny story well not a funny story i will tell you a story i was feeling so strongly about\n                  this about two weeks ago and immediately after i went on\n                  the internet and i am going through i am looking\n                  for a picture for my talk and in front of me was a planet\n                  in a prison cell with a big lock on it which said master on\n                  it and a key that x-factor that master key it is coming it is\n                  coming and it is not going to come like cavalry to save\n                  everything but it is a big factor in i am absolutely\n                  convinced that the end of this prison society is a done deal i think the outcome is going to happen i think it is meant\n                  to happen we are now seeing and it will go on for a while but\n                  we are now seeing the last throes of a dying system where\n                  the illuminati in their box are believing they are crashing\n                  the system to create something else when it is actually\n                  crashing ultimately for another reason is there a real danger because you have got\n                  a cornered tiger that is at its most dangerous when it is\n                  cornered is that possible oh these people in their panic are going to thrash\n                  out in all bloody directions but you know that is just\n                  part of this transition from where we are to where we are\n                  going and the thing is you know you can look at the news and you\n                  can see the conspiracy moving on in britain it is just\n                  getting ridiculous but what you do not see on the news and therefore it is\n                  not in your awareness is how fast the awakening from the amnesic\n                  sleep is moving on and it is moving on dramatically quickly i am not saying that tomorrow the sun\u2019s gonna come\n                  up and everything\u2019s gonna be fine you know we are\n                  deeply into a transitional period here and there is going to\n                  be a lot of challenges and this thing\u2019s going to move on\n                  further but the outcome i think is a done deal this is\n                  going down and then we can start to create a new society based\n                  on consciousness values rather than the limitations of mind and i would just say this because i think this is important from my point of view it is important i think you know there is a great danger that this 2012 thing is going to\n                  be a massive massive diversion it is a spiritual y2k that is what i call it actually a spiritual y2k myself and me of all people who saw a psychic\n                  in 1990 and was told a vibrational change was coming i of\n                  all people should be saying yeah look 2012 that is\n                  it it is more evidence of vibrational change the transformation i\n                  cannot sync with that at all what is slightly concerning is the number of emails i\n                  get and other people i know their websites get of people\n                  saying what is the point of doing anything because\n                  it is all gonna change in 2012 automatically that is like obama selling hope which is always\n                  the horse in front on the carousel no matter how fast you\n                  go around you never get closer to the horse in front that is\n                  what hope does what hope is especially in the way obama uses\n                  it and what 2012 has the deep potential of becoming is a\n                  holding-position where people who could be doing something\n                  now just wait around again what is 2012 symbolically it is\n                  the cavalry coming exactly hey hey the cavalry\u2019s here it is not\n                  coming it is here right the cavalry needs to get on its horse incidentally and stop waiting for another one to come exactly i mean it is like neo in the place\n                  where he is at where he realizes that he has the ability\n                  to become all-that-is and therefore bullets pass through him\n                  because he is no longer there-there right he is actually everywhere i mean i know it is\n                  words but in a sense that is the key that we all hold and\n                  what is happening in a sense is with the wave there is\n                  actually a facilitation that is happening we have been told by various people but one in particular jake simpson who has been on the inside talks about regardless\n                  of how you view the future this wave of energy is actually\n                  coming towards our planet or you could view it as our planet solar system is moving into this energy it is coming so it is like if you are surfing and you know a\n                  wave is coming there is whole groups of people on the\n                  planet getting ready to ride the wave and so in a sense they\n                  have to have the key in order to ride the wave in a sense\n                  you could say the surfboard the consciousness the key to\n                  understanding who they are and what consciousness really is\n                  and how they are united which is part of the key yeah because we are united you see if we know that\n                  we are everywhere and we are totally linked up see i am in this body right now you are in that body\n                  right now and between us it looks like there is empty\n                  space but in reality this is consciousness this space is\n                  incorporated so there is actually no break between you and\n                  i and bill here we are all in this sea of consciousness we are three tips of the same iceberg that is why becoming conscious is the bottom\n                  line of everything if we do not become conscious and\n                  move into these realms of understanding this sort of stuff\n                  you are talking about  that we are all one consciousness\n                  experiencing itself subjectively life is only a dream matter\n                  is just energy condensed to a slower vibration as bill hicks\n                  used to say unless we come from this perspective then what is the key thing of any dictatorship it is\n                  divide and rule and so the whole basis of what they are\n                  doing is taking consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness and dividing it in upon itself you know what we are seeing here is basically consciousness\n                  so manipulated that it is at war with itself because it is\n                  come to so it is been brought to such a low level of\n                  awareness compared with its potential and so the spiritual and the streetwise the five-cents conspiracy\n                  and the understanding of the nature of reality they have\n                  got to go together and you know for too long they have\n                  been apart people say oh spiritual that is new age oh yeah that is credible spiritual that is new age is\n                    that credible and all that stuff they have to come\n                    together because as one unit they are unstoppable apart again divide and rule they have a fraction of their potential\n                    power for change if people come from the heart they will\n                    know what to do exactly if people come from their head it will tell them\n                  a long list of things why there is nothing they can do\n                  or why there is no point in doing them we are at a fork in the road you know symbolically because it is a balance of the two that we are looking\n                  for ideally here but symbolically it is a choice between\n                  the head and the heart it is a head-domination or a heart-domination\n                  of our sense of reality if we take the heart route then this world will transform\n                  from a manifestation of mind to a manifestation of consciousness it has to because this is just a projection this \n                  has to follow what goes on here if we take the choice of mind then we are going to live\n                  in a global version of nazi germany my strong feeling is although we are going to go closer to a global version of\n                  nazi germany ultimately the whole thing will collapse because\n                  the awakening will cease to hold it together if you were a betting man what would you say the\n                  timescale of events the rollout will be over the next one two three five ten years if you were a historian what\n                  do you think you had be writing about i had say - and i am probably being optimistic\n                  - i had say we would live in a global version of nazi germany\n                  within ten years if we take that route if we take\n                  that route we will in ten years time\n                  be deeply into a transition to a very different world it is\n                  just a choice but this x-factor is going to help us to change the world to\n                  one that i would like to live in i do not know what the\n                  x-factor is but i know it is coming it will be fine wonderful well thank you david thanks kerry fabulous it is been a pleasure thanks bill thank you so much cheers looking forward to the future yeah that is a good wrap and the future is now and the future is now and always was click\n                  here for the\n                  video interview \n \u00a0kerry cassidy (kc i am kerry cassidy\n                  from project camelot and we are here with marcia schafer and she is going\n                  to be telling us a little bit more about the future possibly she has written a wonderful book and she can talk about that and tell us what is been going on for the past year.marcia schafer (ms well thank you for that\n                  wonderful introduction what is\n                  been really intriguing in the past year is to see the progression\n                  of where people were and where they have come to in such a\n                  short time what i do as a business consultant is that i work with people\n                  around the world probably in 14 countries at this point and\n                  i give them both hard business skills to get ahead but also\n                  some spiritual mystical and esoteric knowledge so that they\n                  can reposition themselves to really be a new leader for the\n                  tomorrow that we need to have so i am basically planting human seeds by giving them\n                  skills they need to walk into a world to build a different\n                  type of future than the one that seems to be being handed off\n                  to us and it is been amazing to see the scope of the people\n                  who are intrigued by this and want more  because it is\n                  not just the new age realm and esoteric people there is an\n                  entire subgroup of people waking up making the people who\n                  are already aware of these types of things their demographic\n                  group thus is becoming enhanced because it is like you have that \u201cmiddle swing\n                  vote well the middle swing vote is making a difference\n                  and making a decision and they are delving very heavily\n                  into wanting to know all about this greater reality this great\n                  unknown that is out there what does it mean so how many people at this point have had an esoteric experience\n                  like i think i saw a ghost or i saw something\n                  in the sky and they want to know more about it they\n                  want to know more about life\u2019s great questions as to why\n                  are we here and what does my life mean and\n                  have meaning so we delve into the soul aspects but then we go into stage two and reposition them ok so you have all this information now what are you going\n                    to do about it to make a difference because that is why we are all here today at this\n                  time is to make a difference to help to turn a strategic\n                  corner on this planet and they really embrace that and are\n                  taking it very seriously and they are moving so fast in terms of their knowledge and\n                  awareness that some of these people are just blowing my mind you know between a week of i am curious and\n                  then they call back the next week when they have a subsequent\n                  appointment and say i have been out of my body i\n                  had this experience i think there was an extraterrestrial\n                  here or something really and they need answers right so where do you go for answers i mean it is\n                  not like you can really go to wikipedia all the time\n                  to find it or you know call a friend or something so well i could recommend they go to camelot for\n                  one thing excellent yes we will do that that is great so you are working with\n                  executives at companies is this right i am working with executives at companies i am working with just lay people housewives oh my i have got clients that range from 16 to 92 and everything in between well how do they find out about you you know i just find it amazing they just find\n                  me i have never advertised or marketed and you will often\n                  hear me say that google and god are my marketing directors they just find me it is like when the london\n                  sunday times found me and i go how on earth did\n                  you ever find me that is right and they said we found you on the internet they\n                  just did a search so would you call yourself like a personal coach no absolutely not the reason why is that my executive\n                  background and my academic credentials are pretty substantial right and so you know it may be the ego but i worked\n                  hard for them and i like to take credit for them so i have\n                  a tremendous amount of knowledge i am not just coaching\n                  people right i am giving them hands-on experience that you\n                  only get when you have really been in certain positions\n                  at the top of an organization ok and you know i have had the professional training but i mean my god i have an mba but i think so does\n                  george bush so anybody can get an mba forgive me yes can we edit that out but you know the fact of\n                  the matter is there is a lot of knowledge i have hands-on that\n                  really saves them a lot of time and money in terms of when\n                  they are really trying to get repositioned as to what\n                  am i going to do here with this business real information not just motivational coaching not\n                  denigrating motivational coaching because there is part of\n                  that in there keeping people focused and it is an important\n                  part but really tangible technical skills and inside knowledge\n                  that you do not get unless you have been inside an\n                  industry and i have worked across a span of industries\n                  that i can help them get positioned but really they are\n                  mostly hungry for they like that but the esoteric\n                  is that is what i was going to say but in terms\n                  of hands-on in a sense i mean you are a contactee you know yes you are also i do not know how you want\n                  to term it but you are intuitive psychic yes so you must give them entr\u00e9e into certain\n                  worlds that maybe they are already being in touch with right i mean are the people coming to you people that\n                  have a background already in you know having anomalous experiences\n                  in their life possibly even abduction experiences whatever contact\n                  experiences however you want to call it or are they people\n                  that are just you know the blank slate coming to you saying i\n                  know nothing you know enlighten me yes yes and yes it is amazing i tend to\n                  say that i work with \u201creincarnated initiates primarily the people who are really here to be the teachers oh all right but at the same time i had say 20 \u2013 25%\n                  of the people who come to me are just awakening and dipping\n                  their feet in however what they soon discover is they have\n                  had a lot of teaching in other lifetimes and so we kind of\n                  rip the veil away so that they can access that information\n                  and be catapulted pretty far ahead of the game ok by getting into those other training sessions\n                  from other lifetimes but are you able to tap into their reincarnation\n                  history to some degree definitely yeah i can even look\n                  at a picture by proxy that is how i work with people\n                  around the world and the way i found out was quite by accident a woman once handed me a picture of her daughter at lunch and i said did\n                  you know there is a man standing next to her that you\n                  cannot see and i described him and i said he was\n                  in the shoe industry.she said my god that is my father he is been\n                    dead for two years ah and so i also can see your soul path and your reincarnational\n                  journeys so i just use the photos for people and animals and\n                  tap right in to them ok so the same thing that you have access to with\n                  animals you are tapping into with humans yeah it is a lot faster i have to work a\n                  lot harder with the animals than i do with the humans ok so that gives me information so then your life\n                    work becomes your work life which is very\n                    self-fulfilling rather than just going and thinking ok i am going to go on an interview and work for somebody\n                    else or i want to be an entrepreneur but people are afraid and that is the biggest thing\n                  that people have to overcome is their fear whether the fear\n                  of the unknown fear of going forward and being an entrepreneur fear of you know was that an alien that i saw if you have information then there goes the fear it is\n                  just not knowing what to expect that strips people of their\n                  ability to stand in full power so in a certain sense you are assisting people\n                  to find their mission and then possibly to execute it to\n                  some degree i think that is very well put i think that is\n                  very well put and it is really intriguing to watch them\n                  around the world as they are starting to really take a look\n                  at the future and say this can happen i can do\n                  things differently and the future is going to be\n                  very different than what i am being given with the cnn version\n                  of reality that we get fed every day  if i step out of this\n                  scenario that i am being fed and take back life as i want to\n                  live it and see beneath the surface to what is really\n                  going on outside of the matrix absolutely the extraterrestrial component though is such an integral part of that and they all want to know\n                  more because it really brings back our full history on this\n                  planet and it brings back our potential future as we go out\n                  into space and enter into the next frontier so that is\n                  a large component also of what people are getting involved\n                  in and having had a scope of experiences with not just one\n                  race but multiple races giving me a multi-cultural variation\n                  to it  different aspects of technology holography communication different species attributes how they tend to work with humans who tends to take you on a little bit of a joy journey who\n                  tends to give you more philosophical teachings those types of thing are really helpful as people are trying\n                  to gain their own working-ground and wrapping their head around\n                  the extraterrestrial reality well also we are all mixtures of different\n                  races would not you say so i mean you must tap into\n                  that in more ways than you would think in more ways\n                  than even the human race yes well that is what i meant by races \n                  et races various ets so you must actually tap into their sort of lineage if you will oftentimes i can oftentimes you know with if\n                  you take reincarnation in general for example someone may\n                  have 140 lifetimes but only 4 are really germane to what is\n                  going on right now mm hm that is right and their journeys of where they may have reincarnated\n                  not on earth there is often  not always  but there is\n                  often a primary lineage that they really feel affinity to just like here on earth we could say well i really am\n                  more in tune with my egyptian incarnations than i am with my\n                  greek ones exactly yes somebody may have and you know a lot\n                  of times there is no names for these races that we have i can just describe where they seem to be coming from or if\n                  there is something in the common vernacular but they have\n                  something very strong there but people are always positioned\n                  that they have got to find their own answers because this\n                  is not empirical information right and so i cannot give you in 1613 you know there was this particular information you can\n                  go look it up or in you know 42 a.d so people have\n                  to be tuned into their own reality and their own version of\n                  what feels right and what resonates right what resonates with them so these are just like tools and things to help here is you know just a cornucopia of information if it\n                  feels right take it and use it as a tool to grow and if it\n                  does not that is ok just discard it because you have to be your own master of your destiny do not\n                  you dare hand off the keys to the car to me or anybody else right well that is great to hear that that is\n                  your approach so in your own back-experience with the races\n                  that you feel affinity for are you willing to\n                  talk about which races you do because you know if i remember\n                  correctly  and correct me if i am wrong here \u2013 there is\n                  something with the sirians andromedans that you had some\n                  contact there i know you have a real affinity for egypt and\n                  i feel i know you from egypt i have to say yeah a lot of times when i do use those terms as i pointed out they are used because they are\n                  already in the common vernacular and people are familiar with\n                  them my perspective is i will talk a little bit about the\n                  extraterrestrial races but there is something that is\n                  beyond them i think is so much more important that i get people\n                  focused in on and that is what i call the \u201cmulti-dimensional\n                  teachers the more advanced beings who really teach\n                  us to become elevated super-humans almost to be what we aspire\n                  to be and know what we can be you know the best of humanity those are the ones i like to focus in on and stay in communion\n                  with you really almost have to earn your privileges with them it is as if you know as an average person we would\n                  try to get into harvard where supposedly they have wonderful\n                  teachers there although there are also good teachers elsewhere right but you know it is that type of thing i\n                  really feel honored when i have the ability to get communion\n                  and communication with them and that is where i try to\n                  focus people because ok so when you say multi-dimensional are\n                  you talking light beings people that you could call them that they do not need\n                  a body beings that do not manifest in yes they will use one oftentimes but they do not\n                  necessarily need a body and so they are what we tend\n                  to refer to as the old wise masters and they can take any\n                  form any shape they really focus a lot on teaching the understanding of space time  which is so infantile here on this planet  getting\n                  us to understand multiple perspectives how things really work\n                  out there and how to navigate beyond the human experience there is a lot to do with when you get into the very\n                  controversial aspects of time and time travel they teach you\n                  the truth now truth really what is truth truth is a matter of perspective what is truth at one point and to one person is not another\n                  person\u2019s but i feel it is the closest to the truth\n                  that i have been able to get at this point.but the regular extraterrestrial races are the ones that a\n                  lot of people are having contacts with you always hear about\n                  the grays mm hm and what i like to get people familiar with is the\n                  fact that with the grays is that they have some of the most\n                  tremendous powers of holography telepathy of all the races\n                  out there and the power of being able to get inside your\n                  head and anticipate what they need to do for a scenario to\n                  be able to reach out to you or to get you to think that you are\n                  in a certain situation so that you are more comfortable is quite powerful and so you want to break through that illusion mm hm but i also try to get people to understand that stop\n                  looking at things from a human who is very stubborn and\n                  try to understand why these races are working with us in the\n                  capacity that they are and so what the human does is they take themselves out of\n                  the placement of i am just another species and\n                  tries to put themselves as a god-like being and we are\n                  not a god-like being we are just another species in a broad\n                  spectrum that is out there and so when we look well there is also a tendency to put the alien or the et in that position very much so because they are so different and that is a huge gap and a disconnect yeah that is part of our growing up in that\n                  what we have to do is to stop looking at them as gods you\n                  know that is one of the most common \u201cten myths\n                  of extraterrestrial reality is that they are gods\n                  and great beings right they are not gods and great beings we should\n                  think of them as life colleagues and that is\n                  how we should think of every species on this planet also they all have agendas we have got a basis\n                  for what you are doing with your contacts and also with\n                  the people that you are consulting you call yourself\n                  a consultant right yes and so what we want to know is have you had contact\n                  lately and what are they telling you if anything about what is\n                  going on here today excellent question because we have got an economy that is\n                  in the tank right yes and people are wondering what is happening\n                  with their stocks you know the stock market is down drastically\n                  down we have got potential war with iran we have\n                  got all kinds of things going on we are at an incredibly tumultuous situation and i want to give you a kudos because you are the first\n                  person who is asked me that and you really have ask me\n                  questions to get a lot of information out of me sure what has happened is as you know from the\n                  last time i have been contacted since i was in the crib but what they did is they made some what we could\n                  call in an analogy is saying i am hard-wired tapped in and so i have instant communication any time i\n                  need it to the other side so i do not have to necessarily\n                  have an extraterrestrial visit or have them come i have not seen anyone in the physical for a while over\n                  the past couple of years there is been a couple of attempts and i have closed the door  for certain reasons  because\n                  i was not sure who it was in advance and so that is\n                  something that i have done in the recent years unless i\n                  know exactly who it is and i feel completely comfortable it is kind of a pavlovian response but i always have\n                  access to information anytime i ask a question it is\n                  almost like there is a little antenna on all the time and what you are asking is what i am getting from\n                  people all over the world i mean people are really really\n                  scared confused not sure what is happening right but what i want to point out is yeah are we in\n                  the midst of great change absolutely but you have got\n                  to get rid of the baby teeth before the big teeth can come\n                  in and so what i am doing is getting people to look at it\n                  from a different perspective i mean we have been through\n                  all kinds of tumultuous situations ever since the history\n                  of mankind i mean sparta invaded athens you know the romans\n                  took over england we can go right on up through our history where we felt like the world was ending and there was total\n                  chaos within the times within the context of our civilization\n                  in which we live right we are in the midst of one of those times but instead of being terrified we have got to learn to\n                  let go of the things that may have not mattered so much when\n                  we thought they did and get ready for tremendous new opportunity\n                  to build things the way that they should be built to allow\n                  us to live in a society that will benefit us in a new way now a lot of people are not going to like that because\n                  they like their house they have accrued a tremendous amount\n                  of money they like the lifestyle they have but the bottom\n                  line is the planet cannot sustain that anymore ok but so you know that the illuminati\n                  have an agenda you know they are trying to roll that\n                  out as we speak you know that there are efforts to actually\n                  attack iran so you know this is going on in the backdrop and yet you seem to be very optimistic so when you say look they are gonna lose their money they may lose their house certainly the housing crisis is pretty phenomenal but what\n                  is the new style that you are sort of telling them they are\n                  going towards i just want to clarify this it does not mean\n                  they are necessarily going to lose their money but you have to be living in a time right now where we have\n                  to be able to surf the waves and deal with what comes forward what i am doing is repositioning them in terms of looking\n                  at there is never been a better time oh this\n                  is a horrible analogy think about if the carpetbaggers in\n                  the south were a positive thing instead of abusing the south\n                  the way it happened think if it was a positive humanitarian\n                  thing there is never been a better time to get in on the ground\n                  floor right now to get positioned for a different future one\n                  that is gonna include or go beyond the frontiers of\n                  this planet new frontiers in space there is tremendous advances in technology and artificial\n                  intelligence there is tremendous changes in peoples lifestyles there is tremendous understanding of the greater reality which is going to be flooding in to a new degree there is\n                  never been a better chance to be a true pioneer and be tremendously\n                  successful and the message i get over and over again whether it is\n                  somebody who is just raising  i should not say just it is the most important job of our generation is raising\n                  kids  somebody who is raising kids dealing with a family or is a small-time entrepreneur a major ceo who is in\n                  ultimate despair when they get off the phone with me they\n                  say i have never looked at life so differently and\n                  i have such a different vision of the future and of hope that\n                  it is incredible and so what i am doing is telling them and showing\n                  them that it is all about vision and how we look at it and we have just gotta be prepared now if some things are gonna happen they are gonna\n                  happen some things may not happen some things we may make\n                  a difference in by doing things differently thinking differently creating this resistance to this  as i call it you have\n                  heard me say before  this cnn version of reality right and it is all about everything i talk\n                  about is all about taking back our power as human beings as social beings as cultural beings as someone incarnated\n                  within the times we now have tools that we did not have\n                  before ok we have got an oil-dependent regime ok which we have had for a very long time exactly and so what we are looking for is\n                  something that will change new thought-forms a mind that is open to change new thought-forms ok that is gonna be the bottom line is that if they are not willing to change the paradigm then we are\n                  gonna get the same old same old same old right well you are making an assumption ok yeah help me here because if we remain totally\n                  dependent on oil yeah if we do not change the paradigm there is\n                  several things that could happen there could be things that\n                  happen geologically or geographically there could be things\n                  that could happen where those who watch over us may decide\n                  to step in or may not right oh yeah so there is a lot of things that could happen the optimum opportunity for us is to change the paradigm now the intriguing thing is i sometimes get asked well do they tell you who is gonna win the election you\n                    know do they give you advance notice whenever i get information it is usually just days before\n                  the wire because it is already written out there and\n                  they let me know  which has happened in the past elections however in this situation what they do is they really watch because this tells them the pulse of the human being within\n                  the united states as to how they make their decisions what\n                  their trends are where they seem to be putting their energies\n                  and information in terms of where they are going forward because as you are pointing out one pathway does lead\n                  towards openness to greater change and doing things differently the other one does show more resistance mm hm now this is highly controversial but with the\n                  last series of elections that we had  we do not know\n                  if this is true or not  but the information i had been given\n                  in the 1990s was that they were intending for the early 2000s particularly between 2002 and 2004 to be able to make great\n                  headway in terms of making themselves known on this planet but with things that took place and the way they watched\n                  the populace respond to certain things that happened it was\n                  decided that they were not going to shake up the planet and\n                  they were going to wait at that time ok so here we are at 2008 is what you are\n                  getting that they are going to come forward more i do believe that that is gonna happen in our\n                  lifetime i do not get a date i know a lot of people\n                  believe that by 2012 it is gonna happen i can only tell\n                  you potentials i would expect at the rate we are going by 2016 it\n                  should be out in the open could it happen in two years sure could it happen in twelve years sure but at this point in\n                  time i do not know and i am not going to pretend like\n                  i do i am just looking at potentials and the way that\n                  we are going forward anything\u2019s up for grabs but you know as i alluded\n                  to last time you also look for indicators as to what is\n                  out there where it might happen we are getting more into the\n                  open populace and more into the mainstream but remember i also said that one of the major triggers\n                  for knowing when it is coming soon is when there is\n                  an announcement that on another planet they found evidence\n                  of an ancient civilization mm hm if we ever find that then we know it is just\n                  around the corner that may not be our pathway they may not\n                  go that way with us but i would expect \u2013 just in general\n                  terms as they usually do with planets opening up it\n                  could happen ok what you are dealing with are executives as you say there is a growing consciousness change oh yeah oh yeah ok and you seem pretty impressed by it oh i am astonished i am not\n                  impressed in the past year in the difference in my practice i am\n                  astonished ok well that is lovely the people coming to me the level of people what\n                  they are experiencing and once they are beginning\n                  to get some answers put some pieces to the puzzle together how fast they are being accelerated and i have\n                  just basically let go and let them work with those on the\n                  other side who work with them right ok these people are almost like colleagues to me at\n                  this point instead of you know coming as initiates that is nice it is fabulous yes i mean that is got to be a great feeling but you know there are ets with what might be called a negative\n                  agenda or not in our best interests and do you make your\n                  clients aware of who those ets are do you teach them how to\n                  protect themselves the number one thing is teach them how to protect\n                  themselves not just from ets but when you start opening up\n                  the door to the other side anything and everything can come\n                  in right so you do not open up the door till you know\n                  how to shut it so that is the number one thing mm hm however i do not teach them necessarily this one is negative or that one is negative because think\n                  of it when you were a kid you know you had this best friend\n                  and your parents could not stand him because in their\n                  eyes they were negative but you saw value in that person mm hm there may be something there for them that i could\n                  be putting within this paradigm which would be you know unfair ok so what i do is i give them tools of discernment of protection of what to look for the most powerful tool\n                  i give them is how to use their cognitive mind along with their\n                  intuitive mind to look at things perceptively and\n                  to look at this greater reality that is out there and whoever\n                  may be in it and be able to let us say vet them so that they can determine for themselves whether it is\n                  good or bad right whether they are sending them on a positive\n                  mission if you will right right because a lot of these things go on you know jim sparks is one of the well-known conscious abductees if\n                  you will his recall could have and probably does have some\n                  overlays to it even though it appears to be positive so this\n                  is you know a huge dilemma well jim and i had an interesting phone call within\n                  the past year i think it was and before i tell you what else there is one thing interesting those of us who have had\n                  experiences that are not just you know oh i had an experience or i\n                  saw something but have lifetime training there are things\n                  we know about that only each other know so we can again using\n                  the word vet each other very quickly and so jim and i realized that we could talk a similar language and very comfortably very quickly and the thing with jim\n                  is that from what i understand and i may have this wrong but i understand that he originally looked at this negatively but then he soon learned by widening his perspective that\n                  there was a greater agenda more going on than he realized\n                  was going on and he was able to look at it differently right and so that is one of the approaches that is really\n                  incumbent upon all of us to be aware of is that we do not always\n                  understand what is going on when we work with these other groups and that is why you have to think perceptively in\n                  a whole new manner and be open but at the same time be smart\n                  and not give away you know the keys to the vault of yourself\n                  and say again oh they are gods i will do anything you\n                  say right we need to think smartly and say is this right\n                    for me what kind of information am i getting how does this\n                    integrate into my reality does it make sense what am i\n                    going to do with it is somebody taking me for a joyride\n                    here or what exactly and so these are the things that people worldwide\n                  need to know this needs to be a part of our et 101 education\n                  that we have been stripped of by not even being allowed to acknowledge\n                  that they exist exactly yeah so i am doing my best to get et 101 and 401 out\n                  there into the common populous for those who are open for it ok so you are getting information yourself you are\n                  dealing with people that are starting to open up some of which\n                  are quite far along on the path and then at the same time\n                  we have got this i do not know if you want to call it\n                  a \"rolling snowball but whatever this is you\n                  know stuff is coming down the pike some of which will be\n                  earth changes i would not say that very definitively like that right well earth changes you know we have had earth changes since we have been on this\n                  planet right so do not misinterpret what i am saying ok i am using the term \"earth changes\" purposefully it could be small you know it could be a tornado you know ok that is correct it could be a major change in a coastline it could\n                  be a change in the amount of water you know inundated certain\n                  areas you know ecosystems changing it could be small or\n                  it could be major right right so we have a gamut right and what we are wondering and what i am sure people\n                  out there are wondering is to what degree and how soon and\n                  where and this kind of thing and what i am wondering is are\n                  you getting that kind of information or is it all still you\n                  know subject to change i am getting some of that information it is heavily\n                  dependent on where the consciousness of the planet goes and\n                  so that is why it is so important to get people empowered and get them to understand that they have an entrainment program\n                  in front of them in terms of where their minds are where\n                  their thoughts are what they are expecting and how that they are\n                  acting is going to make a difference in what is going to befall\n                  them mm hm it is absolutely critical because the way that\n                  i have been led to understand that time works is that this is\n                  going to impact which timeline befalls us as a greater populous right as far as details i am occasionally shown some things but they always always have predicated it with this is\n                  a probable tendency a probable reality anything can change ok one interesting thing that i understand edgar cayce\n                  had said is that within the past month or two i have\n                  seen some land rising off of florida now whether that is\n                  going to happen i do not know any more than you do but\n                  i would be very intrigued you know that whole bimini\n                  type of line down to the bahamas has been shown to me as\n                  becoming more solidified as a potential uh huh but again i do not know i mean i do not know any\n                  more than i know which horse is gonna run at belmont you know and win but i just listen to it i pay attention\n                  to it and know that it is a potential it is a possibility and we will wait and see just like the rest of us ok so in addition we get you know because camelot's\n                  now been in operation for a little over two years we have\n                  got witnesses from deep black projects we have got psychics we have got intuitives we have got you know covering\n                  the gamut really and the information we get coming at us\n                  is really amazing there is a huge amount of it which is kind of focused on what\n                  appears to be if you are familiar with the iron mountain\n                  report and with some of the agendas that they are trying to\n                  role out now whether they will be successful at that of course has something to do with the way the populace reacts and the consciousness yes what is the iron mountain report reduction of the population through disease you\n                  know actually planted viruses war you know creating what\n                  they call chaos to bring order out of that the kind of order that they are looking for in other words there is a movement to get rid of a certain degree of population there are agendas out there that they are pushing along and what i am wondering is in your work because these agendas in other words you can consult somebody individually on their\n                  life and they can start having a much better view of reality\n                  and of all their potential and you know want to start a\n                  company let us say in fact we just met a couple who they are\n                  starting a very wonderful eco-friendly way of building houses ok kind to the environment you name it but they are in a dilemma right now they have got a child and\n                  they feel that something\u2019s coming down the pike they\n                  actually live already in a fairly what i would consider to\n                  be you know  who can call anything safe but\n                  safe in the sense that it is not on a coastline you are\n                  not going to have a tsunami tomorrow this sort of thing but they feel that america has become actually you know untenable it is not gonna be the america we knew in the past it already is not the america we knew in the past exactly so this is worrying them and they want\n                  to know what their future looks like for their child and\n                  they are actually contemplating moving out of the country to\n                  south america because now well i am getting a lot of south america i have\n                  a lot of clients throughout south america great well let us hear what it is ok what would you say to these people that is\n                  what i am asking i do say what i am about to say because i get asked\n                  this every single time  is that you are going to be guided\n                  to wherever you need to go if something is gonna happen you are\n                  gonna end up exactly where you need to go mm hm and it may not be you know heading high for the\n                  hills and hanging out and being safe with your family because if something were to\n                  happen on a larger degree in this country worldwide people\n                  have certain skill-sets that are gonna be needed in certain\n                  places so this is where i get people to tap into their higher selves\n                  and their consciousness and say just trust trust in yourself because you were not born to pay the mortgage you were not\n                  born to go to your kids soccer game those are things\n                  that come with everyday life you were born as part of a mass\n                  contingency who decided to be here at a time to help enable\n                  a strategic turnaround on this planet mm hm so for god\u2019s sakes listen listen to yourself remember who you are and why you are here and stop worrying\n                  about these things because you will be wherever you need to\n                  be and you will have whatever you need to do at that time.now in terms of the population being reduced whatever we have\n                  been through that you look at western europe being wiped\n                  out by the black plague that is right and so you know as many people have said before how can we know our future when we do not even remember our\n                  past and so we have been through many periods of time that\n                  have had happen to them exactly what is happening now the difference now is we have advanced technology to understand\n                  it differently we have mass communications to know what is\n                  happening immediately some people did not know about krakatoa\n                   which was for some the end of the world you know  for\n                  years afterwards so what is happening now is not all that\n                  different than what is happened throughout history the difference is that we have a mayan prophecy that is scaring\n                  the pants off of people we have the world where we are able\n                  to see it in a way we have not been able to see it before we have environmental tragedy happening every day with species\n                  disappearing and mass pieces of land just melting away we\n                  have a lot of things happening that we know about and so the environment is pushing us in a vast direction very quickly and we are all able to know about this through this grand internet and telecommunications that is right and through our blackberries and whatever else\n                  we are using our i-phones so we have almost like everything\n                  that we have been through in different cycles of time before coming into the greatest culmination right now.the other thing we have  and this is very controversial i cannot believe i am gonna talk about it  on camera\n                   is that when we talk about reincarnation what i have seen\n                  is we have a mass contingency reincarnated again of those\n                  who were at first working at the time that we know of ahknaton but\n                  what i call the \u201cjesus contingency there was the time at that point of what we have been led\n                  to believe was a little bit different than the religious accounts\n                  tend to tell us i mean we have to remember the stories were\n                  written 70 years later at the earliest we have very small\n                  fragments of what happened but there was a mass contingency of people back at that time they are all reincarnated and back here again once again trying\n                  to do this amazing strategic turnaround on this planet hoping\n                  for a different future but goodness look what happened two thousand years ago it\n                  was not the way that a lot of people thought it was gonna turn\n                  out and i do not think certainly yeshua thought it was gonna\n                  turn out that way or maybe the plans were a little\n                  different that is very bold for me to say but i have seen this amazing contingency reincarnated again\n                  back here so if we are facing a strategic turnaround i think we have\n                  a well-equipped group to deal with it if they just do one thing remember who they are come into their power take back the\n                  way that they think and not give away their power to others remember the spiritual component within them remember the\n                  divinity in everybody else that is out there and it is not just\n                  within them.if this demographic group learns to link together the way\n                  that they are starting to and work together they are a bigger\n                  group than anybody ever would believe mm hm and they absolutely can do everything that is being\n                  asked of them to turn it around but it is up to them as i\n                  can say i can give you an admission to a wonderful college but you may not go you may take a different pathway that is\n                  basically what is in front of us.so our group incarnational lesson right now is to find each\n                  other collaborate work together get rid of the pettiness\n                  that has plagued mankind and start doing things on small platforms\n                  or big platforms  not waiting for permission from anybody just going forward and going mm hm because as a lot of your audience really tends\n                  to tap into the clock does seem to be ticking at five minutes\n                  to midnight and you know what even if we have another 17\n                  hours on that clock what we need to do will be beneficial so if we have five minutes to midnight or we have a long\n                  time in front of us it does not matter we need to get going and we need to act and that is why i have\n                  been so busy and i have not been able to be out and talking\n                  to people and doing what needs to be done is because i am prepping\n                  these human seeds everywhere so they go out and cascade\n                  and reach a lot of people mm hm.bill ryan (br we interviewed george green in april\n                  we interviewed george green who is a contactee as well as\n                  you know and his sources tell him that it is nearly too late he refers to the group of people who are aware and alert and awakened as the ground crew  it is just his typology\n                  for that and he wrote a book called what a great name i like it messages for the ground crew and this\n                  is one of the things that inspired us to launch project avalon which is focused on communities awakening resources communication networking sharing information are you just saying actually it is ok you know it will all\n                  be fine no because whatever happens it is gonna work out no i am saying there is a call to action right\n                  now so what is the action if i am watching this video and i am smart and i am aware and i am alert i am focused and\n                  i am flexible now what do i do where do i go what should\n                  my strategy be what advice do you give me personally about\n                  this because i want something more specific because i am very i\n                  mean this is not me personally speaking but what i often do\n                  in these interviews is i ask questions that we are asked to\n                  ask we get these messages every day people say what do i\n                    do how can i help how can i contribute i have got\n                    a feeling of responsibility for the human race tell me what\n                    this call to action should be help me\n                    be focused on a one-to-one basis what i do basically is\n                  that i look at what your reincarnational lessons have been but then i also take a look at what have you done in terms\n                  of your skill-set where is your knowledge and where is your\n                  expertise that we can really position you that you are really\n                  gonna make a difference but add to the mix of that what do\n                  you want to do and usually you can take the three things in terms of your\n                  life and soul purpose and lessons your experience that you have\n                  garnered along the pathway and what you want to do and come\n                  up with some way to position you so that you are a new world a new paradigm entrepreneur.so it is different for every single person you know just\n                  like we have doctors and we have pharmacists and we have\n                  bicycle makers and we have grocery store people and we have\n                  farmers.but at the same time you do not look at it the way you have\n                  been doing it you look at it as how is the world changing how is this 21st century vision different in terms of how the\n                  food delivery system\u2019s going to be are we going to be\n                  working off the planet are we going to be working on-planet what kind of scarcities are there gonna be so you need to look at an entire array of situations to see\n                  where you have the best opportunity to be positioned.a lot of times people have an inkling and they really know that is when they need the hard business sense in terms of ok how do i make this happen for real in terms of you know i need to know certain ways to get my talents out there or\n                  my products out there or my services out there and get them\n                  to the people who need them now this goes back to again in terms of there is this entire\n                  new demographic that is out there which is i am going to just\n                  boldly say us we have different appetites it is like all of a sudden you know everyone's eating meat\n                  and you want sushi we have different appetites\n                  in terms of what we want and what we want the world to be so this is where we are now feeding our own demographic group\n                  and creating this world that is burgeoning out.so you say you want hard answers so does everybody else but it is a little bit different for each person based on to\n                  bill] you might be best at terra-forming you might\n                  be best in terms of going back into maybe l.a and making\n                  some key contacts and re-defining the vision in terms of what\n                  people are going to be feeding on demographically mm hm and so you know i have got i do i\n                  have people who are working with major foundations i have\n                  people who are working within hollywood and l.a i have people\n                  in major i gotta be careful here pr areas and banking and you know all sorts of things where they are doing things\n                  new and differently and applying their skills and they are not just in the united sates because there is\n                  a lot of things going on in other countries that are making\n                  a difference in terms of you know the awakened group down\n                  there well let me ask you this are you yourself going\n                  through any kind of change any kind of dilemmas dilemmas as a result of what is been going\n                  on because we talked to you a year ago and i can look at\n                  you and see that you have gone through some changes no i mean at least appearance-wise it looks very\n                  positive i am curious and i am sure that people would like\n                  to know how are you affected by this change on a personal level i will be happy to share my diet has changed significantly in terms of what i am able\n                  to digest and able to eat sleep patterns have changed my\n                  strength and stamina has changed it is almost as if it\n                  was time to get ready,get yourself back in shape again so there is been changes on multiple tracks in terms of consciousness my consciousness my energy levels the work that i am doing and it is just a microcosm of what is going on with everybody\n                  that i know even people who are not on the enlightenment path\n                  are facing massive changes mm hm so that brings us into something that we have not\n                  talked about and that is what is going on in terms of\n                  cosmic radiation energy forces affecting the earth exactly we are definitely receiving different streams and\n                  it is been detailed that this was gonna happen at this point\n                  in time and it is making people respond differently right so we are going into the center the galactic\n                  center as we move towards that we have got waves of energy\n                  coming towards us and can you talk about that yeah i think it is a good thing to talk about because\n                  it is interesting how you are going to talk about it with two\n                  different groups when i talk to a group that is on what\n                  i call the enlightenment path the initiate path we can go\n                  right into it and talk about it like that i got news for you  we are all here for the swing vote and\n                  so our job right now is not as much to work within our own\n                  group but to get those people that are curious and want to\n                  know more and willing to look through the door at this greater\n                  reality of what is out there and start asking questions and\n                  live life differently mm hm and so when we talk about things like we\n                  talk about radiation cosmic influences affecting the earth we can\n                  speak about it one way but it is gonna sound so far-out\n                  to this other group they are gonna close their ears and be\n                  turned off so when we are talking amongst ourselves we can address it\n                  a certain way but if we are talking to a group where we want\n                  to open up to other people now we start thinking about ok make it in terms that they can understand the reason i am bringing this up is i want the audience\n                  to understand that these are things that they need to be doing because so many people have good information but they cannot\n                  get it past their own small group and we have to start spreading\n                  out more so that is what the information has been given to me is to we\n                  have to understand how to be powerful and effective communicators so when we talk about these radiation influences and things\n                  impacting the planet we have got to remind people that it is\n                  not just woo-hoo you know out there it\n                  really does happen we can get skin cancer from an orb that is billions of miles\n                  away there are radiation belts that surround the earth so what makes it so far out to consider that there are\n                  different radiation and cosmic influences impacting the planet and impacting us as a human species who is on it right now?so what we are finding is that as you alluded to that people\n                  are finding life very different they are feeling different they are having issues in terms of tiredness they are having\n                  issues in terms of energy they are having dietary issues \n                  almost as if they feel like they are being transmuted in some\n                  way but we have to really watch in how we explain that and talk\n                  about that so that it does make sense to other people because\n                  then they will just say oh you are a woman you are going\n                  through a certain stage of life or oh you are a\n                  man you are just tired you are wearing out it is aging etcetera it\n                  is not necessarily aging is it absolutely not we think something's going on we think we are changing\n                  at a cellular level exactly the dna is changing well wait a minute let me interrupt you we\n                  do not know that that is a new age assumption because i have\n                  not seen one study of research that is shown any mutational\n                  impact whatsoever but is anybody really looking at it on a\n                  mass basis right exactly we do not know so i am also really hesitant because\n                  i do have this whole background this whole medical background of walking both worlds is it possible that our dna's changing yes and i have expected it in our lifetime but nobody's tracking\n                  it there is no scientific evidence of it and the whole mythology of this 12-strand dna is not necessarily\n                  applicable to the earth human the power of the genetics lies within the codons and\n                  the codon sequences and the radiation frequency\n                  that comes out within each elial an elial is a mixture of\n                  the chemical bases that make up your dna and so that is\n                  where the power lies within and that is where i believe the\n                  changes are one of the natural ways of mutation one of the four natural\n                  ways is radiation that is how we get spontaneous genetic\n                  mutation.so i do believe and i know that you have read my writings that that is what is happening now as i have been told was going\n                  to happen what we need is we do need somebody tracking\n                  the human on this planet and seeing are there evolutionary\n                  processes going on but there is no money there is no research there is no foundation doing that at the same time we do have to be careful when we make these\n                  assumptions as we are changing i think it is important to say i\n                  believe i think we are changing but until i see the actual\n                  genetic evidence of somebody doing a study showing mutational\n                  changes then i am going to look at it a little differently on\n                  my own personal belief system yeah we are changing i do believe\n                  we are ok well you can also see it in your own life i mean i have to say here we are a year later bob \n                  is looking healthier than he was a year ago i do not know he is\n                  got a new lease on life he is going out he is going to be speaking we thought last year was his last interview i see changes i see physical changes in the people around\n                  me i just cannot ignore it and i think that they are feeling\n                  the changes so these are real i see it in my own body i\n                  see it i mean it is phenomenal they are changing physically they are changing emotionally you will also see a lot of relationships  i have seen more marriages\n                  and relationships on the rocks and breaking up than i have ever seen\n                  in my entire lifetime you see it emotionally and i have also seen a lot  a lot  of people have life and\n                  death situations where a lot of people were all of a sudden they\n                  were tremendously healthy and they are facing cancer and they are\n                  walking through that whole cancer process and many of them thank god are coming through it and clearing it through their\n                  own processes which i think is very empowering right so there is a lot going on yeah so we have gone from the waves of energy coming\n                  at the earth and we have talked about it in a little more practical\n                  terms you are fairly sophisticated scientifically so you have\n                  also addressed that slightly but what are we doing as a planet in your estimation can\n                  you describe the astronomy to people such that they will understand both gamuts  in other words the people that are watching\n                  this that are new to the whole notion and the people that\n                  are sort of old hands but they have maybe not skewed it in\n                  their own minds in the way that you might do you know what\n                  i am saying stop me if i am not going in the direction that i\n                  think you want me to go in here but when you talk about the\n                  astrology one of the impacts that astronomy not astrology but astrology would be\n                  very interesting as well actually they both come in because well let me talk about astrology for a second sure from what i understand we have had major changes\n                  astrologically with some aspects that have not been around\n                  for a couple of hundred years that tend to color and influence\n                  generations of people that grow up under it astrology i think has an absolute foundation to it i do not\n                  think we necessarily read oh this is a me i am a gemini\n                  today and i should do what the newspaper says but as\n                  a more complex process it is been around for thousands of year and i think there is some foundation to it plus with the extraterrestrial teachings that i have had they have\n                  gotten into it somewhat saying that at one time if\n                  i remember correctly they were telling me how the way that\n                  the moon impacts the ocean and has that influence on the tides that the actual planetary influences have an impact on our\n                  cellular components within ourselves i do not remember i had have to go look it up and read what\n                  i had as notes but i remember that they were pointing me to that there really was a foundation to astrological influences\n                  on the human being.so there is those major changes that are coming in that affect\n                  generations that could be an impetus for this as far as astronomy we have what is called the end of the\n                  kali yuga we are coming to the end of a major cycle and we\n                  do tend to forget that we are on a planet hurtling through\n                  space that is moving we just tend to look out the window and see our car parked\n                  out there and traffic going by or look at the four walls and\n                  see our immediate surroundings but we are on a space vehicle and we are moving as if we were a boat in the ocean we are moving through space and as a result of that we are\n                  going through different areas different zones that have different\n                  influences just like if we were on that ocean and we were\n                  suddenly coming to a region that was characterized by great\n                  storm activity and then we would get through it and go on\n                  to a region that may have calmer waters that is pretty much where we are at right now and i think we are\n                  all feeling that effect and you know it is a little bit of\n                  chaos but i think chaos can be a good thing because otherwise you had just stay where you are at and where we have been\n                  has not necessarily been that great in the past.we have tremendous advantages that we have not had but at\n                  the same time we are not paying attention to the full picture and we have to respect the entire cycle of life on this planet and really pay attention to the extinction of species that\n                  is going on the environmental decimation that is taking place and the human being has to really get its act together if\n                  they want to continue to be the leading harbinger on this planet\n                  of the species kingdom ok so what do you think the chances are that we are\n                  gonna avoid nuclear war in the near future i honestly do not know ok i honestly do not know i would like to think they are\n                  very good but i honestly do not know ok and what about the united states the political\n                  system do you have high hopes for us in the future here it is very easy to be negative about it what we are seeing though is we do not have the patience any more for the two-party\n                  system it does not work i mean we have had the tories and the\n                  whigs you know we have had two parties either/or polarization you know left or right black or white i think we have grown beyond the two-party system i had like\n                  to have just one party if it worked you know if they could get something done i think the especially in the united states the start\n                  of america the founding fathers the american revolution it\n                  was brilliant i have the greatest respect for that time but\n                  what it has descended into is really this huge bureaucracy\n                  that just does not work i have worked in the private sector and i have spent many years\n                  in government so i know what goes on and it is just big\n                  corporations too they are just strangled by bureaucracy when\n                  you are in crisis you do not have time for that but the problem's not bureaucracy the problem is\n                  that it is been taken over like a punch and judy show and it is\n                  not a real democracy anyway because no it has not been for a long time the same group controls both sides so actually it is a farce i mean this is not a real election anyway it is not a question of polarization it is a question\n                  of dialectic is not it that they use these \u201capparent\n                  opposites to keep people busy in television debates where actually the whole thing is engineered our whole life is engineered i mean the human\n                  history is so different than it is has been given to us and so what has been happening is \u2013 always  you keep\n                  the human distracted and you can do whatever you want mm hm and so that is why we need to get the human to understand\n                  what really goes on in this planet who they really are so\n                  they can take the power back within themselves and stop behaving\n                  like the herd species the slave-race mentality always accepting\n                  mediocrity and not doing what is right we kill off our best and our brightest all the time i mean if you look through our history anyone that stands on the\n                  fringe and anybody who is been an innovative leader has usually\n                  ended up in the stocks on the chopping block or is wasting\n                  away in prison tortured we do not revere our great ones we kill 'em off the human\n                  species loves mediocrity it is time for that to change i think i prefer to stay optimistic all right well thank you marcia you are welcome this has been a lot of fun and actually quite enlightening i think that people will find it very valuable it is been a delight talking to you again thank\n                  you click\n                  here for the\n                  video interview  \u00a0kerry cassidy (kc this is kerry cassidy\n                  and bill ryan and we are with project camelot we are\n                  here on thursday february 12 2009 and we have got peter\n                  levenda he is a wonderful researcher and author he is\n                  very well known for his book sinister forces which\n                  apparently is a three-book series also for his previous book\n                  called unholy\n                  alliance delving into the background of the nazis peter i just want to say hello thank you so much for taking\n                  the time with us today i have to say i am incredibly impressed\n                  by your writing style as well as your honesty as a researcher\n                  in the way that you write you actually remind me a little\n                  bit of richard dolan and i think you know who he is because\n                  you cite him a couple of times in your work.peter levenda (pl certainly and thank you thank you very\n                  much for the introduction i am very happy to be part\n                  of this great so what we wanted to do is give the listener\n                  basically a background on where you come from how you come\n                  at this material because i think that is really important\n                   the fact that it dovetails with a lot of what richard hoagland jim marrs joseph farrell and others are delving into but\n                  may even have pre-dated some of their work and their realizations\n                  in this area and we are talking about how the nazis how mind control and how the direction america\u2019s going and why we might\n                  be going in a certain direction and what the underpinning\n                  occult significance is of all that and i think your background\n                  is just really stellar in this regard so please just go from\n                  here and tell us where you come from and where you have\n                  been going with all of this well i will try i tried back in the 1970s during the watergate era to write a book that was going to\n                  explore the relationship between religion and politics which\n                  is a nexus that is always fascinated me we tend in the\n                  united states to think of them as two separate entities but during watergate i began to see a lot of the same personalities\n                  crop up that we had run across during oh the kennedy assassinations\n                  and all of that and i started to see deeper and deeper parallels so there was a book that came out in 1960 long before watergate called\u00a0 the morning of the magicians it was\n                  written by two frenchman pauwels and bergier and it talked\n                  a great deal in there about a nazi occult connection but\n                  it was not documented at all and i thought that would\n                  make a great chapter  in the book that\n                  i was planning let me write something about the nazis and\n                  religion or nazis and occultism or mysticism and i went down to the national archives in washington dc this was right at the height of watergate nixon was still\n                  in power he was about to leave it was a month or two before\n                  he left so the whole thing was at fever pitch in washington but oblivious to that in a sense i was at the national archives\n                  looking at captured german documents as i was in the national\n                  archives the archivist there a very famous archivist  anyone\n                  who studied the nazis back in the \u201970s and \u201980s\n                  would have known about dr wolfe  when he found out what\n                  i was trying to do he suggested that i look at the records\n                  of an organization called the ss ahnenerbe which was actually\n                  a division of the ss that was specifically concerned with occult\n                  and mystical research i was stunned he led me to the microfilm rolls i started going through\n                  the machines and here i realized  my jaw dropped  i was\n                  looking at the actual documentation of a full-fledged nazi\n                  program to investigate occultism other authors had talked about a nazi occult connection the book the morning of the magicians talked\n                  about it at length but there was no documentation at all and some of the other books that had come out at that time for instance the spear of destiny and some of the\n                  others talked extensively about this but there was no documentation so it seemed like speculation until suddenly i am staring\n                  at all the documents  page after page after page of research\n                  in tibet tibet expeditions there was research to find the\n                  holy grail there was all sorts of bizarre ss programs that\n                  were being financed heavily by the nazis during world war two so it got me thinking that maybe there is a lot of\n                  documentation in the world maybe you can find evidence\n                  of all of this without having to speculate too much so the\n                  nazi documentation got me very excited i lived in new york city at the time i am from new york\n                  city i was talking to a lot of friends of mine who had their\n                  roots in latin america and south america i read a book by\n                  ladislas farago called aftermath which is about the\n                  survival of war criminals nazi war criminals in south america and i came across the mentioning of a weird establishment\n                  in chile called colonia dignidad the colony of righteousness this was supposed to be a kind of nazi safe-house which was\n                  also a weird religious group high up in the andes mountains and i thought this is just too good to pass up so here not only do i have the documentation from world war\n                  two but now i have a real live nazi sanctuary in south america\n                  which is also a religious operation which is exactly what\n                  i was writing about so i decided to go to chile  this was in 1979  and see\n                  this place for myself this was during the time of the pinochet\n                  dictatorship there was martial law in the country but i managed\n                  to make my way down to a small town halfway down the coast\n                  of chile called parral and close to this small town is the\n                  colony colonia dignidad i managed to go up there the story is told at length in my\n                  book unholy alliance but i managed to go there on\n                  a sunday morning in june of \u201979 and i as briefly detained i was kept there i was forbidden to leave my passport was\n                  taken the film was taken out of my camera i was told by the germans  these were germans these were\n                  not chilenos these were not spanish people  i was told by\n                  the germans that i was not welcome in the country that i had\n                  to leave chile immediately and as i was allowed to leave which was touch-and-go for\n                  a while all the way back to santiago to the capital where\n                  i had my hotel room i was stopped along the way i was in\n                  a bus and i was stopped along the way by troops who had set\n                  up roadblocks who were making sure that i was on that bus when i got back to my hotel room there was a note waiting\n                  for me that said i was on the next plane that a reservation\n                  had been made.so the amount of influence that the nazi network had in 1979 79\n                  was so many years after the end of world war two you know we are talking 25 years later they still had such great\n                  influence in a country so far away as chile that i began to\n                  see there was a lot more going on than even i suspected and\n                  that eventually became unholy alliance i began to see the connections between governments in bolivia chile argentina paraguay an extensive nazi network a lot\n                  of money that had left the third reich when the nazis had lost\n                  the war i began to realize that the nazi party was not a political\n                  party the way we understand political parties but that the\n                  nazi party was a cult if you look at it from that point of\n                  view you can understand the true nature of this kind of evil because the nazi party is they are not going to go\n                  away simply because they lost the war the old war criminals who escaped  and some of them are\n                  still alive a few of them have died recently in south america in chile and argentina they have their followers they have\n                  their philosophy their ideology.bill ryan (br forgive me for interrupting you peter sure but it sounds implicit in what you are saying then that they have support from deep within the governments\n                  of those south american countries well sure i mean it depends on\n                  which regime is in power at any given time but let us\n                  take the example of bolivia klaus barbie who was the \u201cbutcher\n                  of lyon in\n                  france who was a man responsible for all sorts of war crimes\n                  in france at one point became the chief of the secret police\n                  of bolivia i mean he had a federally-appointed position in\n                  that government walter rauff lived for a very long time in chile walter rauff\n                  was the man who designed the mobile gas chambers the vans\n                  that were used to re-channel the exhaust into the vans to kill\n                  prisoners i mean all of these people found safe haven not only in\n                  south america but in the middle east and in asia as well and to a certain extent in australia and in the united states as well absolutely certainly of course we have had\n                  many cases here in the united states of war criminals that\n                  we have found uncovered and occasionally shipped back a famous one which got me very involved in the story was\n                  the man who for a long time was the head of the romanian orthodox\n                  church in the united states here was an archbishop who during\n                  world war two had been a member of the what was the name the iron cross the iron arrow i think a romanian nazi organization who had tortured prisoners here was a man who was a devoted nazi who after the war was\n                  over fled to the united states and although he had no seminarial\n                  training as far as i have been able to uncover he managed\n                  to take over one branch of the romanian orthodox church in\n                  our country in the midwest and was not even discovered until\n                  maybe 20 years ago when he was forced to leave the country so yeah we have helped a lot of people escape the catholic\n                  church also to a certain extent was involved in that in\n                  an operation called caritas during world war two which provided vatican passports to help some of the more famous\n                  war criminals escape to south america so there was a lot of\n                  collaboration and even in our own country in the united states we had operation\n                    paperclip in which we brought nazi scientists over\n                    to help with our space program among other things so that got me working on what eventually became sinister\n                    forces i began to wonder how was it that we in the\n                    united states could have sold our souls so easily to something\n                    as heinous as a criminal organization like the ss and to\n                    the nazis in general to bring their scientists over here to make them work for us and really to give them great jobs to give them positions in our industry walter dornberger is an example who held a job on the board\n                  of directors of bell helicopter all sorts of people people\n                  who worked for the space medicine program in texas at randolph\n                  air force base there is a very big story there right and that has tentacles that go to the whole\n                  mind control aspect i think that you cover that really wonderfully\n                  in sinister forces i mean i cannot imagine\n                  what you do in book two and book three but\n                  i have to say that that is really a huge story well i develop the same ideas in book two i\n                  focus a lot on the charles manson family as a kind of quintessential\n                  example of what sinister forces might be from the behavior\n                  modification mind control aspect and then in book three i sort of lay out what i think\n                  is the whole story and how this works i connect serial killers\n                  to mind control operations and try to understand i mean our country the cia in particular in the 1950s 1960s all the way up through until about watergate until the 1970s\n                  and the rockefeller investigations was involved in one of\n                  the most bizarre experiments of modern times i mean here we were trying to figure out how the human consciousness\n                  worked how to understand memory volition how do we erase\n                  a person\u2019s memory implant new memories how do we make\n                  a person do something they would not ordinarily do  for instance commit an assassination and then forget about it and not know\n                  why they did it i mean this was something like a medieval king you might\n                  think hiring alchemists and magicians you know to contact\n                  the other world we were doing that in the 1950s and \u201960s\n                  and probably still are today we have operations in which we are trying to understand how\n                  the mind works and then to control it like a sorcerer\u2019s\n                  apprentice our intelligence agencies stuck their fingers into\n                  human consciousness and started playing around with the contents what is the answer to your own question peter which you posed just a couple of minutes ago about\n                  how i think the words you used were how america could\n                  have sold its soul to the extent where it not only brought\n                  these nazi scientists over to american shores to give them\n                  great jobs but actually seemingly embraced their whole agenda\n                  and took it much further were there evil forces at work in america during the second\n                  world war or was this something that was opportunistic because\n                  they realized the magic that they certainly held in their hands\n                  and thought that they could use this to their own ends and\n                  it was too great a temptation to resist well i think as usual the causes take place on\n                  different levels simultaneously i think to point in one direction\n                  only might be a mistake i think sometimes it is desired\n                  that we do look in a certain direction and not look in another\n                  one  the idea of misdirection i talk about sinister forces i mean that is\n                  the title of my series and i took that title from watergate\n                  because that is how i started this research and \u201csinister\n                  forces were blamed for that famous 18.5 minute tape\n                  gap on the oval office tapes on nixon\u2019s office tapes where there was suddenly a big gap and no one knew what he\n                  had said i think it was alexander haig or buzhardt who\n                  had said the tape the hissing sound on the tape was the result\n                  of sinister forces and i liked that idea that there was something\n                  darker at work i think that in many cases what we see around us is theater a kind of theater and that there are forces that are deeper darker less visible manipulating events or i like to think\n                  that what we call coincidence and synchronicity is evidence\n                  of the action of a darker force or a deeper force and are these forces also much more ancient because\n                  of course there are many researchers possibly yourself who\n                  conclude that this whole thing this whole dark agenda had\n                  its roots 2,000 or even 3,000 years ago and it is been\n                  growing steadily since then well actually in your book you are talking\n                  about going back into the mounds in america so you are\n                  going back thousands if not millions of years right certainly and there is also the allusion to egypt and\n                  the pyramids and you are talking about you actually\n                  have to get to possible off-world cultures and how we humans how humanity began on this planet when you go that deep really well when i started looking at the burial mounds the idea of the indian burial mounds came to me sheerly by\n                  accident because i was researching manson and i decided to\n                  go where charles manson had grown up which was a town called\n                  ashland in kentucky i was struck by the fact that there were indian burial mounds\n                  right in the center of town and i started to research that wondering what did that mean i had never really come across\n                  this before this was brand new to me i started to look at the fact that these mounds are all over\n                  the united states especially east of the mississippi but\n                  also west of the mississippi to a certain extent i was struck by the fact that there was actually an ancient\n                  civilization in america in north america that we have no\n                  clue about it was just as ancient as anything that was taking\n                  place in the middle east the earthworks that they built were\n                  in some cases more grand and a lot larger than the pyramids and we know so little about it i began to look at america as a kind of haunted house and\n                  i began to ask myself what forces are there really at\n                  work here the coincidences that we come across especially a conspiracy\n                  theorist anybody who begins to investigate  the kennedy\n                  assassination is probably the most famous example  will come\n                  across dozens and then hundreds and then maybe thousands of \u201ccoincidental connections between people places and events which drives them crazy a regular historian a mainstream historian\u2019s going\n                  to say well that was a coincidence and that was a coincidence and that was a coincidence and dismiss them all because\n                  he cannot see a real cause-and-effect relationship but to me and it happens to all of us who investigate these\n                  things we find ourselves bedeviled by these coincidences i mean i was researching sinister forces for a while\n                  in asia i was in southeast asia in remote areas and i would\n                  walk into an old second-hand bookstore and find books that\n                  i needed for my research they were books maybe on charles\n                  manson or something that i had never heard of before scholarly\n                  texts would suddenly appear or texts would appear that had\n                  been written and printed privately by someone involved with\n                  the group that i call \u201cthe nine all of this stuff would fall into my hands even though i was\n                  in the middle of nowhere nowhere near any sort of academic\n                  structure nowhere near a barnes and noble bookstore or anything\n                  like that but just really in the middle of nowhere so the multiplication of these events to me is an indication\n                  that something else is at work that maybe we need a quantum\n                  consciousness approach to history itself not just to our own\n                  minds in a kind of theoretical way or a spiritual absolutely absolutely history yep you are talking about puharich i am not\n                  sure how you say his name puharich puharich and that opens a can of worms around the mind control\n                  and how the mind control itself seems to stem from those early\n                  beginnings and the consciousness that supposedly puharich actually\n                  got into contact  those \u201cnine people  of which\n                  there are people that have written books since then and gotten\n                  involved in supposedly being in contact with if not those\n                  intelligences then others some call them the giza intelligences so\n                  it is all going back to somewhere back there as well well yeah i mean if you begin with puharich you can see the contours of what i am talking about quite\n                  clearly because here was a man who was a researcher into the\n                  paranormal but he was also a captain in the u s army and\n                  a medial doctor all of these things all together and this\n                  was all during the korean war here was a man who was giving lectures to the military on\n                  how to weaponize esp you know how to use man\u2019s telekinetic\n                  and telepathic powers as a weapon in the fight in the cold\n                  war at the same time he is holding a s\u00e9ance or a\n                  series of s\u00e9ances at a farmhouse in maine to which he is\n                  invited a handful of people but the people he is invited\n                  are some of the wealthiest families in america the most powerful\n                  families in america blue-bloods i mean who\n                  are descended from the signers of the declaration of independence the thing that fascinates me about this is that this is thoroughly\n                  documented stuff there is no speculation about this at\n                  all anyone can go and look it up and find out for themselves\n                  that these people did meet they conducted the s\u00e9ance they were in contact with some extraterrestrial or supernatural\n                  group of beings which called themselves \u201cthe nine and we are talking about people who were also tangentially\n                  involved in the kennedy assassination which would take place\n                  ten fifteen years after these events i mean it is stunning i mean you ask yourself what is the connection how could\n                  this possibly be yes what did you think of picknett and prince\u2019s\n                  book the stargate conspiracy that you must have\n                  read as part of your research i did read the stargate conspiracy and\n                  i wanted to shout at picknett and prince just go a little\n                  bit further go just a little bit more and you will see the\n                  connections right back to the kennedy assassination i was thrilled that they were writing about these events about \u201cthe nine also they were writing about\n                  puharich they had mentioned him they had mentioned this group but they had not drawn the connection they had not connected\n                  the dot between for instance arthur young who was a prominent\n                  member of \u201cthe nine a man who invented the bell\n                  helicopter which i had mentioned just a little while ago as\n                  having been involved with nazi scientists when you talk about \u201cthe nine are\n                  you talking about a human group or an off-world group or\n                  is this an allusion to two groups of nine well when i talk about \u201cthe nine i am focusing first on the human group because those are\n                  the names of the people that we know but of course they were\n                  considered to be the earthly representatives of this spiritual\n                  or extraterrestrial group that called themselves \u201cthe\n                  nine ok what is that earthly group of nine well the nine included families \n                  for instance arthur young and his wife ruth forbes paine\n                  young who is a relative of john kerry\u2019s as a matter\n                  of fact \u2013 john forbes kerry so we have arthur\n                  young and his wife ruth forbes paine young we have a dupont we have an astor all as part of this group\n                  as well as puharich so the astor family was there  a very\n                  wealthy american and british family the astors of course\n                  everyone knows the astors and the waldorf astoria etcetera etcetera john jacob astor was on the titanic so\n                  we have the astor family we have the duponts of course \u2013 extremely powerful wealthy influential american family and we have the forbes\n                   as in forbes magazine steve forbes and all of\n                  that that family was represented her name was ruth forbes paine paine was one of the original\n                  signers of the declaration of independence she is a direct\n                  descent along that line by marriage and arthur young himself the inventor of the bell helicopter so you have a family grouping here of some of the most aristocratic\n                  family names in america if we had royalty they would duponts\n                  and astors forbes and paines did they call themselves \u201cthe nine or is this your term for them i mean did they have an agenda\n                  or some kind of thesis or reason for being together and were\n                  recognized as a group of that size well they called themselves \u201cthe nine in\n                  this fashion they held a s\u00e9ance puharich was conducting\n                  a s\u00e9ance he had a medium from india a dr vinod and\n                  vinod was in telepathic communication with a group of beings\n                  that was somehow in space hovering over the earth and there\n                  were nine of them and they told the group of nine individuals we are nine and you are nine therefore you are the brahmins who are\n                    going to bring a new wave of enlightenment or a new wave\n                    of evolution to the planet we are going to use you\n                    as our vehicle for causing this kind of spiritual evolution this jumpstarting of evolution if you will ok and this was also a take-off on basically what the\n                  illuminati had been their philosophy since the beginning of\n                  the group that we call the illuminati of which these families\n                  are all part well that is the implication i mean otherwise why are these people as i said before some of the wealthiest\n                  individuals in the united states in maine in a barn in the\n                  woods on new year\u2019s eve when they could have been anywhere\n                  else in the world they had the money they had the wherewithal they had the connections instead they are holding s\u00e9ances\n                  in the freezing cold in the winter in this barn what is the motivation for this what is the purpose how\n                  did they know each other we do not know so much about\n                  that we know that puharich was the guy bringing them all together\n                  for the s\u00e9ance and they willingly went and took part\n                  in this endeavor not just once but several times so their motivation on their own i do not know i would not\n                  want to speculate except to say we are talking about the\n                  most powerful people in our country at the time and the analogy that you are drawing here is\n                  that there is good evidence that the nazis were doing\n                  something similar both before and during the war and yet\n                  you are saying that this practice of powerful individuals\n                  from powerful families in a powerful nation-state are suddenly\n                  doing the same thing several decades later well yes i mean less than ten years later if\n                  we count the end of world war two as \u201945 these people\n                  were meeting in the early 1950s and what himmler was doing himself i went and visited\n                  in germany the castle that he had renovated called wewelsburg it is near the town of paderborn in germany and this\n                  castle was developed by him to be a kind of vatican for the\n                  ss it was going to be their spiritual headquarters he was conducting very similar rituals there he had duplicated\n                  a kind of \u201croundtable a sort of arthurian camelot\n                  kind of idea there would be 12 knights around it which were\n                  the highest ranking ss officers they would gather in meditation at this table in a room which\n                  was directly over a crypt and in the crypt would be placed\n                  urns containing the ashes of ss officers as they died the\n                  high ranking ones there was special niche for each one there\n                  were swastikas engraved in the floors and the whole nine yards and so the similar idea of meditation of trying to contact\n                  supernatural beings to guide the ss was now being duplicated\n                  by a group called \u201cthe nine and if we think in terms of race  you know the ss like\n                  all the nazis were obsessed with race and racial purity \n                  suddenly with \u201cthe nine we have as i said the\n                  blue-blood of american families duponts astors paines forbes we have this gathering of the for want of a better word the most racially acceptable to the nazis grouping in guided\n                  meditations in the woods doing the same thing except there\n                  were not twelve in this case there were nine very specifically so i am not trying to draw too close a connection between\n                  what the nazis were doing and \u201cthe nine the practices\n                  were quite similar it was a group s\u00e9ance it was a\n                  meditation it was something to do with evolution of the race so you have a lot of the same themes ok but what you also i think continued to investigate\n                  is to find out where that information that they were receiving\n                  from \u201cthe nine went from there because i believe\n                  there is a trail that connects through sri [ed note stanford\n                  research institute] and hal puthoff and ingo\n                  swann sure remote viewing and actually then circles back\n                  and also has to do with people that were involved in mind control\n                  then utilizing some of that information and/or is it guiding for example the agenda of the illuminati to this day well it certainly did make that route that you\n                  just described and the connective tissue in all of this of\n                  course is andrija puharich puharich was the man largely credited\n                  with having discovered uri geller for instance the famous\n                  israeli psychic he brought geller to sri in california to\n                  be tested there was also a connection with sri and that grouping with\n                  the people at jonestown the connections are vast with all\n                  of this and if you start pulling at the threads you become\n                  extremely paranoid what is the connection with jonestown well yes in volume two i have about 100\n                  pages alone just on jonestown because the amount of work that\n                  has yet to be done just to decode that event is still leaning\n                  on us we really know very little about what really happened\n                  at jonestown slowly but surely more and more information has been revealed\n                  over the last 20 years or so some of it by a good friend of\n                  mine called jim hogan an investigative journalist who spent\n                  a lot of time researching jonestown and came up with some of\n                  the cia documents to verify that jim jones himself was some\n                  kind of contract agent with the cia he had what is called\n                  a 201 file at cia so we know there was a connection\n                  there but as far as the connection with sri i think it was russell\n                  targ  if i am not mistaken i believe it is russell\n                  targ who was the man who was involved with both jonestown and\n                  sri and hal puthoff yes there is also the link back to puharich as\n                  working for the cia yes as far as uri geller was concerned geller\n                  always said that puharich was his handler for the cia he made\n                  that statement several times but as far as sri\u2019s concerned russell targ the physicist\n                  who was part of the sri group by his own admission was involved\n                  with a group of jonestown survivors he was director of counseling\n                  at their human freedom center in berkeley and left them to\n                  join sri to study psychic phenomena the group that he was working with elmer and deanna mertle after he left them a few weeks after targ left them to join\n                  sri the mertles were found dead murdered execution-style\n                  in their home so the connection between targ sri and jonestown\n                  is definite what it means we do not know but we do know that targ worked with the mertles which was\n                  a group of survivors of the jonestown massacre people who\n                  had left the jim jones church the people\u2019s temple and\n                  were trying to raise consciousness against it they had written\n                  a book about the people\u2019s temple and targ was working\n                  with them he left to join sri and a couple of weeks later the mertles were dead murdered execution-style so you have to also say that with all of this what\n                  happens is some people will fall on working for the positive\n                  and some will be working actually for the negative agenda within the fact that there are connections between these organizations\n                   because there is very definite connection between the cia\n                  and sri and between puharich and cia so you get all these\n                  connections with cia gordon novel the kennedy assassination all of these link back to the cia so it gets really convoluted it is really fascinating i know that you have studied the occult in great depth have you come to any conclusions are you going down some trails\n                  now that perhaps are not publicized well not publicized to the point that i do not\n                  quite know how to explain all of this yet in any way that makes\n                  any kind of sense from an academic point of view but it has\n                  occurred to me during this kind of research as i mentioned\n                  before i consider coincidence and synchronicity to be evidence\n                  of the operation of these forces i think that these forces are there and i think that groups\n                  of human beings from time to time make a conscious effort to\n                  contact these forces to manipulate them to use them for their\n                  own advantages i think that the cia did that with mkultra and operation\n                    bluebird and all of the mind control experiments they\n                    did if you take a human being and you try to manipulate their\n                  consciousness you try to erase their memories replace their\n                  memories program them as assassins as an example then what\n                  you are doing is you are essentially initiating\n                  that human being i mean you are putting them through a kind of spiritual\n                  initiation but with none of the safeguards with none of the\n                  spiritual preparation that a person would normally go through\n                  to become protected against whatever demons are invoked in\n                  the process so it was a very irresponsible callous cruel\n                  program that the cia had undertaken at that time irresponsible or actually intentional i mean that is\n                  really the question is not it of the heads of the cia if they knew what they were getting into and they were invoking\n                  these negative forces in essence and bringing them into the\n                  bodies of programmed assassins  and some of which are actually\n                  sleeper agents that may indeed be part of our society at the\n                  moment sitting around waiting to be triggered in essence what you are looking at could be an intentional\n                  agenda and that is where it gets very interesting when\n                  you are starting to look at the future and what we are\n                  actually faced with well yeah i mean i think one of the good indications\n                  of just how bad it got was the man who was for a long time\n                  in charge of this program at the cia called sydney gottlieb dr sydney gottlieb when the mkultra project\n                  was \u201cdisbanded by richard helms in the mid-1970s gottlieb went a little weird he at one point became a buddhist\n                  monk he went to india he tried to essentially pay for his\n                  sins he would not talk about this program anymore but he became\n                  a kind of recluse and was obviously trying to live simply he was living off the land he was living in a farmhouse i\n                  believe in virginia after he came back from india he was\n                  a man who was shattered by the realizations of what he had\n                  done by the sins that he had committed against other human\n                  beings so if the leader if the creator or the handmaiden of this\n                  operation felt that way i wonder what the actual day-to-day\n                  perpetrators felt the people who were actually involved in\n                  the day-to-day programming of these individuals i think there is a tremendous amount of evidence to suggest\n                  that sirhan sirhan was just exactly one of those assassins\n                  who had been created i have gone through sirhan\u2019s\n                  diaries the diaries he was keeping up to the point he was\n                  arrested for the assassination of senator robert kennedy and he has no idea what happened does he he does not i mean he admits he did it because\n                  he figures you know he did it i mean if he is arrested\n                  for it and he was there he must have done it but he has no\n                  memory of it and his diaries are extremely suggestive of someone\n                  who is been through a behavior modification program something\n                  like a mind control program it is fascinating stuff i read a wonderful book which i have got i\n                  also had the experience of what i guess you could call the\n                  international library angel suddenly depositing a book at your\n                  feet when you are traveling it was a book by\n                  long john nebel who was the art bell radio host of his day who operated in the 1950s who wrote an amazing book about\n                  the control of candy jones you must be familiar with that yeah i do i am fascinated by that account\n                  as well and i think it is genuine it is been attacked of course by other researchers and authors by saying that\n                  long john nebel kind of made it up or candy jones never went\n                  through this but if you really go through as i do which is the thing that\n                  i do is i go through and i try to document what goes on i\n                  met candy jones a couple of years before she died i was actually\n                  interviewed by her on radio in new york city and from my point of view what she discusses especially\n                  her trips in asia and taiwan have the absolute ring of truth i mean i lived in asia for a long time i traveled in those\n                  countries the things that she discusses i believe actually\n                  did occur i think that she did not make them up i can recognize\n                  the places she is talking about i read that book several times and it rang very very true to me yeah it was not a sensationalistic thing that she\n                  was making up i really do believe what she said happened had\n                  happened so where are you going now with everything because\n                  you do not really keep your blog up you had been talking\n                  about mccain as a possible mind control victim and i think\n                  there is great evidence to that effect i had be interested\n                  to hear what you have to say about obama i do not know\n                  what your current situation is the powers that be are they\n                  aware of you have they made your life difficult because you\n                  seem to be one of the best researchers actually pulling these\n                  threads together in one place and what does this mean for us at the beginning\n                  of 2009 looking at the next few years and what this may mean\n                  for this country and the world yeah these are very good questions i took a little\n                  time out for a while to get a graduate degree in religion and\n                  the thesis that i wrote i published as stairway to heaven which\n                  came out about a year ago i have another book on the freemasons\n                  which is coming out in april i have kept my hand in all\n                  of this but i have been doing a lot of academic-type work\n                  on the one hand and then a lot of investigative work on the\n                  other the political situation the way i look at it these days as i mentioned before is theater it is basically theater we are watching a play being acted out in front of us and\n                  we are all willing or unwilling audience members in this\n                  play i think we have to not believe a lot of what we see as being \u201creal it is\n                  a kind of consensus reality we all kind of agree that certain\n                  things are real and certain things are not and i always like to talk about the root of the word reality because the word comes from a very interesting indo-european\n                  root which also gives us royal it gives us what is real and\n                  what is royal and basically what that means is to\n                  me whatever the king says is real is real in other words there is a kind of agreement that we\n                  all enter into a kind of contract where we agree that certain\n                  things are and certain things are not real and\n                  i think we have come to the point where we have to revisit\n                  what we call real we have to revisit reality to a\n                  certain extent we have to come up with a new paradigm a new\n                  way of looking at reality because it is not working for\n                  us the old way of looking at it.we are too easily manipulated our country has made a\n                  science of the manipulation of reality since at least the korean\n                  war if not before communication science which is being taught in the universities\n                  all across the country came into being as a result of world\n                  war two and psychological warfare studies i mean the same\n                  guys who created psychological warfare for use during the war\n                  were the guys who in the private sector developed programs\n                  for teaching advertising marketing and communication mm hm so we are really struggling with psychological warfare\n                  being directed against by manipulating our reality right a form of propaganda and mind control in\n                  and of itself just as television becomes in a sense a mind\n                  control tool on a massive massive scale i used to live as\n                  i mentioned in asia and we would get cnn out there i do not\n                  want to single out cnn particularly for opprobrium but they\n                  are sort of an international news organization that you can\n                  pick up on cable channels all over the world there was one particular instance where i am in kuala\n                  lumpur and there was a riot going on on cnn on television in a restaurant it was being carried live and we are\n                  looking at the television screen and we are at the site\n                  where this riot is supposed to be taking place and there is\n                  no riot there we are watching and we are all looking at each other we are watching the screen and we are saying what\n                  is this it turns out there were three or four people in a corner somewhere\n                  and a camera was on them and the way it looked it looked\n                  as if there were all of these really angry people rioting i was getting a phone call from friends of mine saying go\n                    away get out there is a riot taking place we can\n                    see it on television and we are all sitting in\n                    the restaurant saying well where is the riot you know there is no riot i mean it was manufactured news essentially and if that happened that one time how many other\n                  times has this happened how much of our news is being manipulated\n                  or controlled or created you know as we watch it right but as a researcher going into this as deeply\n                  as you have you must be able to look towards the future and\n                  come to certain conclusions and or think about certain uninvestigated\n                  trails to look down i am curious do you think for example there are sleeper\n                  agents because you know we keep having these incidents happen\n                  and they seem to be evidence of mind control operations in\n                  which you have school kids suddenly flipping out and so on\n                  and so forth where is it all headed well if we characterize the agents of this madness\n                  as individual human beings we might be missing something darker\n                  and something deeper i believe that there are individual agents of course and that is what i investigate that is\n                  what i write about that is where the evidence leads me but sometimes i think that there is something else at work\n                  here i think that there is a kind of level of consciousness\n                  that is creating this for us as well and that we are\n                  victims of it because we have not learned how to fight\n                  back we have not learned how to take control of our own\n                  consciousness we are essentially allowing others to do\n                  that for us i think that we have a kind of responsibility perhaps now\n                  more than ever because the information is available to us of fighting back by taking control of our own minds and taking\n                  back control of our own consciousness of trying to deprogram\n                  ourselves if you will away from what we are being fed\n                  on an almost hysterical basis i mean things have ramped up to the point where paranoia fear anxiety stress levels have increased so exponentially it is as if someone wants us to have this collective\n                  nervous breakdown we have to take a stand and fight against\n                  it i think that if my research has shown nothing it is\n                  shown that humans who are involved in this quite often do not\n                  really understand it that well themselves i am talking\n                  about the cia i do not think that the people who ran mkultra really\n                  understood the full ramifications of what they were doing they had a very narrow focus they wanted to create deniable\n                  assassins as an example and that was their focus they did not\n                  realize the other forces they were unleashing at the time and i think that there are paths there are shamanistic paths there are paths in the occult that might be actually beneficial\n                  for us to investigate to understand how we have been manipulated how our consciousness has been manipulated our reality itself\n                  has been manipulated i think we have a chance because there\n                  is such an amount of information available but we are headed into a very dangerous impasse a very dangerous\n                  place i agree but i think that we do not realize how\n                  much power we have as individual human beings or as small\n                  groups of individual human beings to combat this madness and i think we can take back our minds and our lives\n                  from these forces from these sinister forces are you able to say anything do you feel about\n                  the role of the vatican ah how much time do you have you know about the work of eric phelps and that\n                  large body of research that he among many others represents i just wondered if you could pull some of those threads together\n                  once again for the benefit of our listeners who would like\n                  to see as much of a summary of the big picture as you are able\n                  to present here right i grew up as a roman catholic i was born\n                  into a catholic family in the pre-vatican ii days and when\n                  vatican ii happened i was actually kind of disappointed i\n                  did not like all of the you know guitar-playing masses\n                  that were taking place and all this stuff i felt a little\n                  cheated of the mystery somehow but then as i started to research the nazi information that is\n                  when phase one of my disenchantment or dis-enlightenment or\n                  whatever you want to call it took place and that was understanding the degree to which elements within\n                  the vatican had assisted war criminals with hideous records\n                  to escape how they protected them at safe-houses throughout\n                  europe and then in latin america how they gave them vatican\n                  passports how we had the spectacle of nazi war criminals dressed\n                  as priests entering argentina entering brazil in one case\n                  performing a marriage ceremony as a priest i mean i cannot even imagine what that poor family would\n                  have felt had they known that it was a man responsible for\n                  the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people blessing\n                  their union as a fake priest so all of this began to that\n                  was phase one.phase two was realizing that what we have been told about\n                  christianity itself particularly about the catholic church is based on so much disinformation and so much manipulation\n                  of history and historical facts that we really do not\n                  know what the catholic church is any more or what it ever\n                  was we do not know what is going on there i mean the vatican scandals the masonic scandals the\n                  propaganda due the p2 masonic scandal alone should have alerted\n                  people to the degree of perfidy and cupidity that was taking\n                  place within the vatican i mean we had licio gelli and roberto calvi all of these\n                  characters who were heavily involved in the vatican and at\n                  the same time financing right-wing terror squads assassination\n                  squads in europe in latin america working with francisco\n                  franco  the dictator of spain for so many years  heavily\n                  involved with fascist organizations and operations it was mind-numbing the extent to which this was taking place so i have a very hard time you know i am thankfully\n                  a very lapsed catholic you know i want to stay that way i cannot believe that i would go to the bishops archbishops\n                  of the catholic church and accept spiritual guidance from people\n                  whose own morals and ethics i have to question on almost a\n                  daily basis well also there is a link between the vatican the illuminati and the us government apparently can you\n                  talk about that a little bit because when you are talking\n                  about the nazi influence in america and you are talking\n                  also about the powers that be with paperclip the\n                  ultimate space program and all of the levels at which the\n                  vatican is involved from what i understand their secret\n                  service was basically the model upon which secret services\n                  all over the world have been built well sure in fact even the ss the nazis emulated\n                  the jesuits i mean himmler wanted to create a jesuit order\n                  for himself and that was what the ss was hence the black\n                  uniforms and the rituals in the churches and the rituals\n                  at night in the forests and all this other stuff it was a\n                  kind of pagan jesuit order that himmler was trying to create i mean people may have disliked or even hated the catholic\n                  church or the vatican but there was so much of it that they\n                  wanted to emulate that they wanted to duplicate but the problem\n                  is that we have so much information to discuss that it would\n                  take hours to get into it i will just bring up one or\n                  two points that will be enough to scare you and probably i think the place to look in the beginning if you want to\n                  see the connection between the vatican nazis and even the\n                  illuminati would be the knights of malta and some of the other\n                  chivalric orders that the vatican maintains and supports i will not even go into opus dei which is a whole other\n                  kettle of fish by itself i mean we are talking about\n                  a man who created that order who had pro-fascist pro-franco\n                  sentiments i mean there is no question about it and\n                  how he could be canonized is absolutely beyond me but anyway look at the knights of malta look at the connection\n                  between the leaders of the cia many of whom were roman catholics members of the knights of malta or members of one of the other\n                  chivalric orders around the vatican when i was growing up in the bronx in the 1960s i saw with\n                  my own eyes the influence that churches had with intelligence\n                  agencies and intelligence agencies with the churches i mean i witnessed it as a young man of 18 19 years old working\n                  with a church in the bronx that was heavily involved with intelligence\n                  operations which was actually a front for intelligence operations and that brings us back again to david ferrie and jack martin\n                  and the kennedy assassinations because i met the bishops who\n                  ordained and consecrated david ferrie jack martin all these\n                  peripheral figures that you saw in the movie jfk you know being played by joe pesche being played by walter\n                  matthau i think these were people who were heavily involved in a church they\n                  were also involved in intelligence activities they were also\n                  involved in anti-castro cuban activities and considered to\n                  be involved in one way shape or form with the assassination\n                  of a president in dallas so the nexus between religious organizations and intelligence\n                  organizations is thick it is just thick you know and like i say i saw it with my own eyes i know the church\n                  that ferrie and martin belonged to in 1968 when jim garrison\n                  was starting ramping up that investigation into the kennedy\n                  assassination david ferrie died mysteriously but he was a\n                  priest and a bishop with one of these churches so do not you also get into maybe what is\n                  going on with the agenda in terms of how this plays out for\n                  example in the economy of the world going downhill and the\n                  desire for the one world government and how there\u2019re\n                  certain problems being created so that a solution can be created as you know possibly david icke\u2019s work in that area so what i am wondering is are you following those threads obviously you see the economy going down in america and around\n                  the world there are sacrifices blood sacrifices some of\n                  these things or maybe even all of them are actually planned as\n                  some kinds of sacrifices to these hidden dark entities in\n                  order to make certain things happen upon this planet well if we do not characterize the economic\n                  situation as a purely economic situation i think we can see\n                  more clearly what is taking place in a previous era this might have been a vast military conflict it might have\n                  been a world war three or a world war four or something now we are fighting that same war but we are using\n                  economics to do it this is a different approach to the same\n                  type of general control that is being exerted over the\n                  world i mean the whole world cannot go broke the money is somewhere that is the funny thing the humorous part of this thing if you want to be funny about it that fact you know we are\n                  thinking the whole world economy is going down but basically\n                  what happens especially with capitalism is somebody gets\n                  rich and somebody gets poor so who is getting rich during watergate we were told to follow the money and i think\n                  if we follow the money today we can find out who is doing\n                  what to whom we can find out who is actually doing this\n                  kind of control i have been looking at it i have been trying following\n                  the money in today\u2019s economy is extremely difficult to\n                  do i think even members of congress are finding themselves\n                  totally unable to even explain what is happening some\n                  of them are not able some of them are strictly not willing but if we can follow the money if we can start pulling the\n                  threads on the money over the last 12 to 18 months we can\n                  probably figure out who is behind this thing for me it is been very difficult to do although i have\n                  been trying to cover it i think the answer is out there i\n                  think as fox mulder used to say the truth is out there but we have to look at the evidence and the evidence is there it is just it is very hard to figure out.if we are talking about manipulation of the world economy it is because we are being prepared for something\n                  else obviously there is an agenda it is not strictly\n                  to make some people rich at the expense of others that is\n                  been going on forever we do not need a collapse in the\n                  world economy to do that so if a collapse is being engineered in the world economy it is to create a circumstance or a set of circumstances\n                  conducive to another phase of action which has nothing to do\n                  with the economy as you said it might be a one world government\n                   possibly it might be something more heinous than that a collapse of the economy may be a way to keep in place the\n                  types of controls that were put into our government during\n                  the last eight years it may be a way of preempting any kind\n                  of change that we thought we were voting for  some of us\n                  anyway so there may be a way to as 9/11 essentially was a reichstag fire which gave the president\n                  total control of the government in terms of the patriot act\n                  and everything else the collapse in the economy is essentially\n                  another 9/11 and it is going to give the government additional\n                  powers that it never had it is just another kind of controlled demolition it is another kind of controlled demolition it is a what is the word i am looking for a consolidation of all of this if we put the patriot act and some of the other things that\n                  took place  the wiretaps the illegal stuff that is\n                  been going on  and we now couple that with government control\n                  of banks and corporations you know we have fascism some people are talking about creating socialism or communism\n                  here but fascism is also a wedding between the state and the\n                  corporation it is not just socialism that we are\n                  talking about the one thing that nobody wants to talk about is the fact\n                  that we have been creeping closer and closer to fascism\n                  in the last 40 or 50 years and that scares me believe it\n                  or not more than socialism does or even communism what frightens\n                  me most is a kind of fascism an american style of fascism well i mean this is the premise of jim marrs book as you know yes and it is a basically a fait accompli in\n                  the minds of many even behind the scenes with richard hoagland\n                  and his investigation into nasa and the symbolism there and\n                  the paperclip background behind you know the space\n                  program so the agenda seems to have been a kind of fascism\n                  that stemmed out of world war two and is being continued today but where is that going once they have total control then\n                  what you know it is almost like they already have total\n                  control as it is one wonders what next and the only thing we have gotten so far in our study\n                  of this mystery is the idea of population elimination in other\n                  words they want to eliminate large segments of the population they have not been able to do so with other means with\n                  viruses and so on in other words this control you are talking about has\n                  to lead to some thing because control is something\n                  they have in a sense always had but they are tightening\n                  it and as you say they are consolidating it so with\n                  what purpose in mind well that is another good question and it is\n                  something too that would probably take a long time to try\n                  to analyze i think that \u201cthe powers that be are\n                  not 100% happy yet they do not really feel they have\n                  the kind of control they would like part of the reason for that is the explosion of technology which seems to be getting out of control you do not notice\n                  it perhaps as much in this country as you would overseas where\n                  this kind of technology the internet in particular has given\n                  people at the grassroots level a voice they never had before so the governments in those parts of the world especially\n                  in developing countries are struggling very hard to control\n                  the technology and control access to information right now we are talking over the internet and this will be\n                  available on the internet so people who want to can hear it but this kind of control eventually will probably have to be\n                  extended over what we are doing over the internet over\n                  the free exchange of information i think it is already started and i think it is\n                  going to continue until there is control over information and once you control information you control reality you\n                  control consciousness once the independent operators are gone once they have been closed down there will only be the\n                  party line that is left that is 1984 is not it well it is 1984 some people listening\n                  to this are gonna say to themselves you know these are\n                  the aluminum hat people you know the tin-foil hats we are all worried about vast conspiracies taking control i want to tell you something to the listeners who maybe think\n                  that at times this is out in left field i was on somewhat\n                  friendly terms with a man called norman mailer a famous author one of america\u2019s most famous novelists and journalists\n                  and authors who passed away recently  a man i admired very\n                  much he was kind enough to praise my own work and write a\n                  foreword to unholy alliance he spoke in my presence about the fact that america was heading\n                  towards fascism many people of that social setting other\n                  authors some of them pulitzer prize-winning authors people\n                  who are understood to be great thinkers great members of the intelligencia have all said the same thing to me or in my presence that\n                  we are heading towards fascism that america according to norman mailer back a couple of years ago he\n                  said america was in what he called a pre-fascist condition but that we were heading inexorably towards fascism other\n                  authors since then have said the same thing so this is not something that only a handful of people on\n                  the absolute fringe are feeling these are things that are\n                  being felt on other levels by other people who are not involved\n                  in this kind of investigation people who are not doing this\n                  kind of research people who have just opened their eyes and\n                  who have looked around and said my goodness this\n                  is what is going on we are becoming a fascist country one of the things that confuses people sometimes as you must be well aware is the idea that somehow there is\n                  a spectrum with socialism on the left and fascism on the right\n                  and the two are very different actually they meet in the\n                  middle kind of loop round in a kind of circle one going to\n                  the left and one going to the right extreme socialism and\n                  extreme fascism are actually very similar that is the point i was just going to make to have fascism or to have socialism you have to have a marriage\n                  between the state and business i mean that is how it is\n                  done either the government owns the means of production as it does\n                  in a socialist or a communist country or the state and the\n                  corporations have a working relationship a nice working relationship as eisenhower warned us about when he left office he talked\n                  about the military industrial complex and how frightened\n                  he was that that was happening that is fascism so does it matter to the average person whether or not the\n                  government owns the means of production or the government and\n                  the state and the corporations are in bed together does it\n                  really matter to us on the street it is going to be the same effect we are still\n                  going to be controlled our economy\u2019s going to be controlled our freedoms are going to be drastically curtailed so in the\n                  end what difference does it make?i have talked to people about 9/11 a lot there is\n                  been of course a lot of discussion about 9/11 and i have\n                  always said it was a reichstag fire it is what happened\n                  in germany how hitler took complete control of the government\n                  was the reichstag burned down and he blamed the communists\n                  for it and my point was do we really care who burned down the reichstag\n                  at this point all we really care about is the fact that it\n                  brought hitler to power so in our case what did 9/11 do it pushed all of these heinous\n                  attacks on our liberty and our privacy it pushed them right\n                  into the forefront it made it acceptable that is what\n                  happened that was the real effect of all of this we can talk about 9/11  for instance we can talk about\n                  conspiracies but let us not lose sight of the fact that\n                  what happened the effect of it was that we lost more liberty we lost more privacy right and so then that gets back to the overall\n                  agenda yes \u00a0and it is not a conspiracy theory it is\n                  a conspiracy fact when you look at all the evidence and what is\n                  happening is that this particular agenda is being rolled out and of course it is very heartening that you do talk\n                  about how consciousness and the role of consciousness was getting\n                  out of the hands of the people in mkultra such that\n                  people like gottlieb himself who was certainly one of the\n                  masterminds behind all of that goes on his own sojourn to\n                  india looking for some kind of spiritual way out i think of the responsibility for which he you know it is\n                  basically like walking around in some kind of living hell i am sure being inside that guy\u2019s head and so in essence all of this is playing out in the microcosm\n                  around the globe not just america because i see it in many\n                  countries in fact england has the best surveillance system\n                  on the streets cameras etcetera so what is happening\n                  is on some level it seems to be manifesting in america sort\n                  of in a more overt way but in a covert way it is actually\n                  existed in small countries under despots that were financed\n                  by the cia and then across the globe masterminding the governments\n                  behind countries like switzerland and so on well i mean what is very amusing to me in\n                  a sardonic sort of way is the fact that in the united states\n                  if you talk about conspiracies you are pooh-poohed you are\n                  shot down it is considered you know paranoid fantasy and yet we recognize without hesitation the fact that conspiracies\n                  like this exist in every other country on the planet right so when benazir bhutto the former prime minister of pakistan was gunned down last year in pakistan everyone said of course\n                  it was a conspiracy there were elements of the pakistani secret\n                  police involved al quaeda may be involved or the taliban or who knows what but automatically it was a conspiracy however according to mainstream historians not a single\n                  person assassinated in this country has ever been assassinated\n                  by a conspiracy no conspiracy nothing to see\n                  here move along right we have this idea somehow that the\n                  u s is immune to these events and yet we overthrow dictators in foreign countries we have\n                  overthrown and committed assassinations in guatemala in iran\n                  back in the days of the shah we overthrew the government of\n                  allende in chile we put pinochet in power all of these things\n                  we do on a regular basis and we have done it for years\n                  and years and years and yet somehow it does not take\n                  place inside the united states why is that why is it so impossible\n                  to believe right and i think though nowadays it is\n                  a lot easier to sort of get people to not so much believe but really understand the roots of conspiracy and ever since\n                  the death of kennedy i think that america\u2019s eyes have\n                  slowly been opened along those lines at least many although\n                  certainly 9/11 you still get people not able to accept the\n                  possibility that a conspiracy took place there so again i guess we have gone full circle with you in\n                  many ways we are going over some material here that is\n                  just the roots are everywhere the conspiracies if you\n                  will are everywhere it is very heartening to know that you are behind the\n                  wheel investigating all of this and documenting it and pulling\n                  as many threads together as you are i encourage people to\n                  follow your work i certainly want to read a lot more that\n                  you have written where i am going now i am still in the\n                  midst of all of this you know i am still in the midst\n                  of researching i do not know what my next book will be as i had mentioned i have a book on freemasons coming out\n                  in april which is kind of a look at the connection between\n                  the masonic society and the mormons and some of the occultism\n                  that was taking place in our country before during and after\n                  the revolution the american revolution so i look at the connections\n                  that were there it is kind of a general look at freemasonry i am\n                  not a freemason myself of course that is coming out\n                  in april stairway to heaven was really more about kabbalah\n                  and chinese alchemy and that sort of thing a very spiritually\n                  oriented book trying to understand some of the implications\n                  of some of the ancient writings so where i am going to go from here i am constantly\n                  collecting information i am constantly building up files\n                  of data trying to see more connections and i am sure\n                  i will have something like this to share with you soon that is fabulous one thing i do want to ask\n                  you the book you were talking about that you investigated\n                  the occult quite deeply i was involved with it yeah the necronomicon of\n                  course i mean i made no secret of that i have done some\n                  interviews based on that that was an occult work that i think\n                  today it is one of the critical texts probably of the\n                  mid-20th century on occultism it is been reviled by a\n                  lot of people people claim it is a hoax other people\n                  say it is a very terrible book or it is a very powerful\n                  work i look at it as the survival of an old middle eastern occult\n                  practice which involved a process of initiations going through\n                  a series of \u201cgates gaining greater and greater\n                  illumination or enlightenment at each time each passing of\n                  the \u201cgate it is an interesting book and\n                  the events around it were interesting as well we will have to revisit that with you because\n                  i am fascinated by that as well sure well thank you peter this has been fascinating we are both really very interested in what you are\n                  gonna be doing in the future as well as to get into your work\n                  after this conversation and thank you for taking the time\n                  today to talk to us it was my pleasure thank you very much click\n                  here for\n                  the\n                  original\n                  audio \u00a0\n\n\npart 1 in the first ten minutes of this recording there were technical\ndifficulties connecting with michael tellinger on skype kerry\u2019s\ncomments re connection problems have been deleted but interesting\nbits of information she gave while waiting are included here as\npreface to the michael tellinger interview kerry cassidy (kc this is kerry cassidy project camelot\nwhistleblower radio and hopefully we will be on the air tonight with\nmichael tellinger he is the author of slave species of god he is a wonderful researcher and he is also a musician which is\nabsolutely fascinating he has basically been investigating the genetic-engineering history\nof our species he has got archeological evidence that he is been uncovering he\nhas two websites one is https www.slavespecies.com and the other one is https www.adamscalendar.com adam\u2019s calendar will show you some photographs of his\nwonderful discoveries in south i believe it is south africa or somewhere in africa attempts to connect to michael tellinger were not successful at this\ntime on the tape]\n\n\n\n\nwe were on mel fabregas radio show the veritas show https www.veritasshow.com today bill ryan and myself project camelot was interviewed for\ntwo hours i think it was earlier today that show was not live contrary to what i thought it was pre-recorded and will be released i believe possibly in a week or so i am not sure how they\nschedule the releases of their shows but that is what i\nunderstand we believe that it is possible that the haiti earthquake was the\nresult of the weather wars that are happening behind the scenes and\nthat is i realize rather stunning information that is a huge huge tragedy it is quite likely that is part of an overall agenda\nbeing rolled out as we have talked about on camelot from time to\ntime other than that let me see if i can add some other information we\ndo have a new whistleblower actually i have got a few of them it is an interesting time now we are really having some\namazing things going on behind the scenes as well as on the more\nobvious level this new whistleblower was talking to us about\nsynthetic beings coming in through a stargate in the gulf of aden and\nthat right now there is a military buildup in the area \u2013 that is\nalongside yemen for those of you who do not know and as i was saying we have a couple of new whistleblowers one of which\nis talking about synthetic beings that are being possibly maybe coming back to this planet \u2013 beings that were created by the\natlanteans and then taken off-planet prior to the destruction of\natlantis and allowed to develop they are basically robots that are\ndeveloping on their own as artificial intelligence does have the\nability to do supposedly they are on the way back to this planet meanwhile our\ngovernments have created their own groups of synthetic beings the\nscanners that are being put in at the airports now are part of this\neffort i guess to identify whether or not the person coming through\nthe scanner is human or not that is actually what is\nreally really going on start of interview kerry cassidy (kc this is kerry cassidy project camelot\nwhistleblower radio and i believe we are now on the air again hopefully this will work it seems that we are having all kinds\nof technical difficulties michael are you on the air with me michael tellinger (mt i can hear you kerry wonderful how are you doing excellent i am very glad to hear voices finally for a\nwhile i thought we were going to have these strange gremlins creep in\nand prevent us from having a chat exactly well it would not be that unusual i have to say so for those of you that have hung on for the last say twelve\nminutes while we have been getting ourselves hooked up here i am on the air this is kerry cassidy from project camelot and\nwe are on the air with michael tellinger michael is an author-investigator and he has written a couple of\nbooks \u2013 actually i think at least three \u2013 one of which is\na very well known book called slave species of god this is\nall about the evolution of man and basically calls into question a\nlot of the preconceived notions of where we came from how we were\ngenetically engineered it follows along with the work of zecharia\nsitchin in my view and maybe we can discuss that in more depth other than that from what i understand you are also a musician is not that right yeah that is true kerry what i find interesting is that\nwhen i watched one of your interviews one of your many interviews i\nnoticed that quite a few of the people that you interview started\nlife as musicians it seems that this musical vibrational frequency\nseems to penetrate all forms of life and especially those that start\nto question life and origins at a later stage in their personal\nlives i know david wilcock is a musician himself and einstein was a\nmusician and many of my other scientist friends are musicians that\nplayed music in their earlier careers it is very interesting i grew up in a musical family my mother sang opera in europe and\nthen when we moved to south africa she was very active in the opera\nand the classical musical circles here she still teaches today at\nthe age of 76 she still teaches music as a sort of a she is\nknown as \u201cthe voice of peyah a magician oh that is fabulous it will interest you to know that i am\nalso a singer/songwriter of a sort i was very much involved in\nmusic and i actually have just got done recording an ep i guess you\ncall it yeah so i have been having a lot of fun with music myself and\nyeah i think that there is a synchronicity there with quite a few\npeople that have musical backgrounds being interested also in\nscience and for lack of a better word the occult or the hidden yeah you know what i find interesting kerry is that if you\nunderstand the concept of music and how music works it is a lot\neasier to understand the vibrational frequency spectrum and how it\nall fits together \u2013 and harmonic frequencies \u2013 and how\nthings can be harmonious and resonant frequencies and octaves and\nthe concept of different dimensions when you break them up into\nvibrational scales and so forth it really just suddenly the light once that penny drops\nfor you you step out of the musical realm and you step into the\nscientific realm and the penny drops for you you see that there is\nan absolute parallel crossover from one to the other yeah i have to agree with that i know that for example dan\nburisch and marcia mcdowell are working with something they call\nlotus which has to do with healing abilities of crystals they have been investigating that for some time i believe i also understand that you are using sound in and maybe you can\ncorrect me if i am wrong but from what i understand you are\nactually using sound in order to help you in your archeological work is that right yeah it is true to a large extent it is really the\nsound \u201celement and the understanding of sound\nfrequencies that got us to well me specifically to sit up and\npay attention to the structures of these ancient stone ruins the\nkind of stones they used why they built in specific forms and\nshapes and why they are all connected by these strange channels\nthat we called roads originally it is only when we started thinking of frequency and\nspecifically sound frequency as a potential solution the penny\ndropped for us and we could unravel what i believe is one of the most\namazing discoveries in human history and the evolution of humans and also presenting the evidence that many people like zecharia\nsitchin and many others that i have met with here in south\nafrica \u2013 credo mutwa being the other one  \u2013  people have\nbeen writing and talking about the origins of humankind and these\n\u201cfirst people that lived here in southern africa and\nhave been ridiculed for it for many decades it is just really exciting to be finding and discovering on a\ndaily basis the physical evidence to support all those early\nwritings often where people went on just feelings more than\nscientific fact we now are starting to find overwhelming physical evidence and proof\nfor those first early civilizations of very early homo sapiens\nliving in south africa and southern africa so how is it that you are actually using music or sound to aid\nyou in your work well what first caught my attention was the fact that the\nstones that have been used to build these circular stone ruins these\nancient ruins they ring like bells \u2013 every stone especially\nwhen we started clearing the sites to be able to take people to them the ones that we have chosen that are easily accessible as we\nstarted clearing the sites i started realizing this strange incredible sound and noise that these stones were making i suddenly realized that this was not just an accident because\nthese stones were making a completely different sound and they rang as i say they actually ring like bells the most beautiful crystal\nor metallic structures and i am going to be loading some of\nthese sounds onto my various websites very soon just so people can\nactually hear it that is really fascinating i think that that is so\ninteresting how did you come to discover that they rang like bells i mean you were moving them and they made sound or did you actually\nhave a theory and start i do not know beating against them to\nsee if they made different sounds no it was you know discovery is a strange beast it really is and it takes sometimes it takes a few days sometimes\na few weeks sometimes a few months and this particular discovery\ntook us more than seven years to figure this out and many times\nthese things happen by accident i already had a theory that the circular shapes of the stone ruins\nwere there for a specific purpose and reason to generate energy of\nsome sort and that these ancient civilizations used the energy that\nthey generated in these circular structures to extract the gold and\nto crush the ore and to transport the ore well use the energy\nthat the moment you see a circular structure the alarm bells should start\nto ring if you know anything about frequency and sound and generation\nof energy that is exactly what happened to me i just immediately felt\nsomehow intuitively i suppose \u2013  i am not a psychic but\ni am a very strong intuitive and that is been becoming more\nand more active in my life i realized that these were energy\ndevices then suddenly a few weeks later we accidently discovered as you\nsaid while we were clearing the sites i discovered that these\nstones have this incredible \u2018ring so i went back on the mountains and i started experimenting with\nthese rocks and tapping them in different ways with different objects\nand seeing how they ring and then i discovered that not only do they\nring like bells but different stones seem to have been chosen for\nspecific sounds and what seems to be very specific reasons and uses\nin sound generation for example the flat stones that they use to construct the walls of\nthe circular ruins have very distinct and separate frequencies we\ndid a recording a few weeks ago just before christmas i went and\nspent the whole day or actually two days recording the sounds then\nwe sat and analyzed these sounds in a sound studio and captured the\nfrequencies recorded the frequencies i mean you know what i mean by frequencies kerry since you are\na musician so you understand what i am talking about we are talking these are stones in circular ruins okay we\ncaptured from 200 hertz which is very low frequency the human\naudible range goes down to arguably around 30 hertz all right so\nwe recorded from 200 hertz all the way up to 60,000 hertz so 60\nkilohertz which is starting to approach the upper limit of human\nhearing that is what we found so already we find that just the stones that were used to build the\nouter circular walls have this amazing capacity then what we find in among the stone ruins are these very strange sausage-like long stones they differ in length from probably about a\nmeter sometimes even longer to a foot or two feet in diameter they vary from two or three inches to probably about six or seven\ninches these are like long crystals and when you lift these stones up these long sausage-like stones those are the ones that ring most\nbeautifully and most clearly and the sound carries it is\nabsolutely spectacular it literally takes your breath away when you\nhear it for the first time well this is fascinating i think it is so interesting\nthat you would be a musician have that background and then also get\ninto sort of this really unusual field that you have sort of\nended up in and i would love to know how you ended up in this field i know we had you on our show when we did the other rendition of the\nproject camelot radio show and excuse me if i did ask you this back\nthen but i am very curious to have you share with this audience a\nlittle bit more about your background i know that you have a medical\ndegree that also seems like sort of out of left field i\nhave to say in relation to archeology then i also want to say that it seems to me that with the sound the\nfrequency that these stones have from what i understand it is\npossible they also used sound to move them into place just as they\ndid with the great pyramid i am seeing from your writings here that this find that you\nhave this adam\u2019s calendar in general is located possibly on\na ley line or a longitudinal line which is the same as the great\npyramid is that correct that is correct yeah i think maybe what i should do is\nput into a larger perspective for your listeners and for the\naudience just so they will know what the bloody hell we are\ntalking about we are talking about a discovery of a very large ancient\nsettlement of circular stone ruins that covered at one stage over\n200,000 years ago already i know that is a number that\nmany archeologists and historians really struggle with but that is\ntheir own problem they need to come to terms with that there was a\nvery very large ancient settlement of over ten million stone ruins\nthat i have counted and there are more \u2013 i stopped when i\ngot to about ten million and that changes our perception of ancient human history completely whatever you held dear or close to your heart or whatever you\nbelieved before flies right out the window it forces us to sit down\nand re-evaluate everything we thought we knew about our ancient human\nhistory we are dealing here with a vanished ancient civilization that\nexisted at the bottom tip of africa south africa \u2013 and\nzimbabwe mainly \u2013 incorporating the great zimbabwe ruins incidentally for those that do not know that yet all of these structures every single one of them were circular in\nits shape and each of them was linked by a road or a channel now that is highly irregular you do not see that in any\nancient civilizations at all it is completely unbelievable for us to consider that such a\ncivilization could have existed that was so vast it makes the cities\nof today absolutely pale by comparison in their size and then in among all of these stone structures there are thousands\nof kilometers of beautifully shaped and constructed agricultural\nterraces that link all of these structures together okay i am sorry to interrupt you here we are about\nto go to break we will be right back on the other side of this\nhour and this is michael tellinger on project camelot radio this is kerry cassidy project camelot\nwhistleblower radio we are on the air with michael tellinger who has written a wonderful book slave\nspecies of god and a couple of\nother books as well michael are you there i am here okay great so you were actually giving\nan overview of the structures themselves and that is also\nfascinating and i had love you to continue i had also like\nyou to cover a bit of how you got into this in the first place after\nthat okay where was i kerry i think i was\ntalking about the agricultural terraces is that correct yes exactly so hello for some reason we are having\nsome trouble hearing you at least at my end i do not know if\nthat is true for everyone can you hear me now yeah now i can okay so just to put it into perspective imagine the whole of southern africa pretty much most of south\nafrica and including zimbabwe being covered in a continuous stone\nsettlement made up of millions\n\u2013 over 10 million \u2013 circular stone ruins linked by\nancient roads all \u2013 each and every one \u2013 of these\nroads is walled on the sides by stone walls and then connected all of this in between all of this you have thousands of\nkilometers miles of agricultural terraces that were neatly and\nbeautifully constructed which brings to mind i asked you how many\npeople must of have lived here and my estimate and my calculation\nwould say anything between 50- to 200-million people you know the guess is yours over a very extended period of time and those kind of numbers just do not jell with\nour understanding of human history especially when you start going\nback to 200,000 or 280,000 years ago the way that i got involved in this was because\nof my book called slave species of\ngod as you mentioned earlier that\ndeals with the origins of humankind and the evidence that points that we are a cloned race a cloned species that was specifically\nintended for a very single-minded purpose and that was to mine gold\nout of the gold mines in southern africa which brings us to the third important anomaly\nhere among these ancient civilizations and that is the thousands of\ngold mines \u2013 thousands of ancient mines that we have\ndiscovered personally i have probably crawled through\nat least a hundred of these ancient mines and they all look very\nsimilar you know either they are big holes in the ground or\nthey are long passages and channels carved into the sides of\nmountains some of them have survived some of them have\nbeen re-excavated and reopened by the gold miners in the gold mine\nrush the gold rush of the 1850s the mid-1800s the same as there\nwas in california and australia there was a similar one here in\nsouth africa that then set up the city of johannesburg and opened up\nthe gold reef well guess what these guys did not\ndiscover the gold this gold was being mined here 280,000 years ago\nwhen it started according to my research that is really extraordinary i am\nwondering just off hand whether or not those link-ups or some of\nyour discoveries were helped to any degree by credo mutwa or other\nsort of indigenous peoples to the region that might have had stories\nor so on that related to the discoveries that you have made definitely credo mutwa has played a very\nimportant role and continues to play a very important role in these\ndiscoveries as i mentioned earlier you know credo has\nbeen saying some very remarkable things for decades for over 50\nyears already and he is been ridiculed for it and laughed at you know that he is a \u201cmadman and so forth by the\nestablishment well fortunately we are now discovering\nthat everything credo\u2019s been saying is true and i am\ndiscovering that almost on a weekly basis everything that credo has\ntold me personally in the past year and a bit has been turning out to\nbe true first of all just to link him to these\ndiscoveries i met a chap called johan heine who came to one of my slave species\nof god presentations in pretoria after my presentation he said to me listen i have got to show you some photographs i have been\nphotographing these weird strange stone structures from the air for\nthe last 15 or 20 years and i have been trying to show them to\nthe authorities and the archeologists and so forth and they just\nkeep telling me they are not important they do not mean\nanything so when he showed me these stone ruins i just\ninstinctively and immediately knew that there was something really\nimportant about them well a few months went by and eventually johan\norganized a helicopter he runs the biggest forest\nfirefighting project here in southern africa so he is got\nhelicopters and airplanes that fly all over the place and fight\nforest fires and so forth so he organized a helicopter for us to go\nflying around and over these ruins and i literally my life was changed in one\nday my entire life changed and i realized that we were dealing with\nsomething so monumental that it would probably consume the next\ndecade of my life or so and since then 2-1/2 years\nhave gone by and that is exactly what is happening we realized that all the work that i was\nwriting about and the research i was dealing with in slave\nspecies of god was now finding its\nroots and the physical evidence for these ancient civilizations and\nthe first people on earth right here in south africa \u2013 and it\nall revolves around gold i am sure you are aware of this from\nall the interesting people that you have interviewed and spoken\nto over the years that you have been running project camelot well yes actually we know in essence the\nenlil enki story of the origin of man basically told in part by\nzecharia sitchin and then picked up by some others i am just\ncurious if you are aligned with sitchin\u2019s view completely or\ndo you diverge in any particular areas well i suppose i am in line with\nsitchin\u2019s work and his writings i am becoming more in\nline with it the more i look at these structures and the discoveries\nthat i am making and the discoveries johan heine made first of all the stone calendar that we now\ncall adam\u2019s calendar\n\u2013 that is the other book that i wrote with johan heine adam\u2019s\ncalendar and that deals with the\ndiscovery of this ancient stone calendar site at a place called\nkaapsehoop in south africa in the mpumalanga that is just spectacular because the calendar\nstill works today but it is so the structures the attributes of\nthe calendar are so strange and so weird that it really boggles the\nmind and the age of it is so staggering that you really have to dig\ndeep into your understanding of what is been happening on this\nplanet earth what i find interesting is when you read\nthrough the works of sitchin and especially the lost\nbook of enki there are various\nreferences now remember when sitchin wrote that he did not\nknow anything about this ancient civilization or the structures that\nwe are discovering now the more i go back to that particular book especially the lost book of enki i am finding incredible very accurate references to some of the\nthings that we are discovering for example he mentions that about \u201c40\nshar after arriving on planet earth enki built himself a special place of observing \u2013 \u201cobservation\nin the deep abzu on the edge of a cliff overlooking the valley all kinds of references like\nthat it was in line with his \u201cabode\nin the north which i believe\nwas the great zimbabwe and the \u201ctwin\npeaks further up which i\nbelieve are the two big pyramids in giza and guess what we find that adam\u2019s\ncalendar is exactly in line with great zimbabwe and furthermore also\nexactly in line with the great pyramid of giza along the 31-degree\nlongitudinal line and 31-degrees east longitude and that is not\na coincidence that is fascinating i am\nreading bits and pieces of the lost\nbook of enki and find it fascinating\nmyself i am wondering if you are also then looking at that book\nnow for further clues as to what you might search for definitely i was able to get myself an\nelectronic copy of it so it is easier to reference and find\nthings find specific references that i am looking for which\nhas helped tremendously there is also a wonderful reference to\nenki\u2019s younger son by the way kerry i believe that you are\npsychic yourself i am not sure what your personal sort of\nstrengths and paranormal strengths are but i pick up from the work\nthat i have been watching that you are quite psychic yes thank you i appreciate that yes i am finding more and more actually i think as you said it is\nbecoming a bigger and bigger part of my life as time goes on yes well as i said i am not\npsychic but i am intuitive highly intuitive and i have\nstarted to really trust that side of my psyche and whenever i read\nsomething or i suddenly have a weird thought that i believe has been\nchanneled to me by a higher intelligence or higher powers or\nwhatever i take it and i run with it i have been finding that since i have\nstarted doing that things have become a lot easier and it is\njust amazing how things unfold just to once again put things into some sort of\nchronological order here it was really the discovery of adam\u2019s\ncalendar by johan heine in 2003 that really opened up the door to\nthis discovery and realizing how much larger and bigger this ancient\ncivilization is you know johan was told that these\ncircular structures were of no historic importance they were just a\nbunch of cattle kraal  that\nwere built by the migrating bantu people or the people during the\nsouth african boer war \u2013 they built them for their cattle or\nquick settlements while they were migrating or something like that well you know those were just such ludicrous\nand stupid statements to make by historians and archeologists and i\ncan understand why they would make those kinds of statements because\nthey just had no clue or understanding of the size and extent of this\nancient civilization how many of these stone structures there are and how big these ancient cities once were they just did not have a clue so they would\nmake silly statements like well you\nknow these structures were built by the migrating bantu people and\nthey were moving south and they were probably built by the women and\nchildren and stuff like that and these are the stories that go into our\nhistory books i am absolutely appalled by the lies and the\ninaccuracies that have been written into our history books and then they make statements like the\nchannels or these roads that you see that link these stone\nstructures together they were built by the gedi people or the bakoni\npeople to drive their cattle on and stuff like\nthat they just make stuff up and put it in the books it\njust drives me nuts well yeah i think that that is\ntrue and i think it is fascinating because i am kind of\nlooking over the net and i am seeing that in many ways you are\nactually out there doing some work that is not being done even\nwith all the people we are interviewing there are not a lot of\narcheologists or even people that are researchers in general that\nseem to be following your work closely as i have been to some degree and also because i am aware that it seems that you are\ngoing down a road that most people just simply are not i find it very fascinating i see that they\ntend to want to sort of paint you as somebody who is a dabbler who sort of stumbled into doing this on the side but what i really\nsee is that this in many ways is really a mission for you yes this definitely has become a mission and the more people say things about me or call me a dabbler \u2013\ngreat the more they talk about you the more other people discover\nyour work you know and that is fine i am okay with that but you know actually it is so\ngroundbreaking that it is again one of those kinds of things\nthat we come across on camelot which is why\nis not this front page news you know in essence well i will tell you why i can tell\nyou why it is not front page news and this has been happening to\nme for the last 2-1/2 years i will get a phone call from a\njournalist \u2013 and incidentally that is why i actually now close\nthe doors to all south african journalists i do not talk to them\nanymore because they behave so badly and like spoiled brats they\njust seem to have no backbone or journalistic integrity if you want\nto call if there is such a thing well i hope so well you see you are\nworking outside of the field you are not really working in the\nmainstream you know your articles do not appear on the 8\nof the clock news and your interviews do not appear on 60\nminutes and so forth absolutely you are working out of the\nfield yourself yes i am talking about the mainstream\njournalists the people from television and radio and the sunday\ntimes in soweto they make an\nappointment with me well this is a while ago now when we first\nstarted making these discoveries two years ago and then they come\nand spend an hour or two interviewing me and i tell them all the\nstuff that we are discovering and then they go okay well this is just too far out i cannot believe any of this\n\u2013 which i can understand once again i love this thing people say i have\nnever heard of it and they use that\nas a scientific argument you know which is fantastic exactly they have never heard of if it cannot\nbe you know and then these journalists run off to some\nprofessor or some academic at university at johannesburg or cape\ntown and say well\nmichael tellinger says that they have discovered these and what does this poor academic know they know absolutely nothing they lead poor sheltered lives i feel sorry for these people in\nthese little academic boxes behind walls in universities you know the last time these people were out\nin the field was probably 20 years ago and now suddenly they get\nconfronted by some journalist that tells them this guy has discovered\nthe ancient lost city of enki or solomon\u2019s gold mines and\nstuff like that and these guys ah man it is a bunch of rubbish you know that is their answer and guess what the journalist does the\njournalist goes back to his office and later writes michael\ntellinger is talking rubbish because professor so-and-so says he is\ntalking rubbish and that is\nwhat happens yeah exactly it is like a vicious\ncircle one of the things that i can give you a clue to\n\u2013 and i do not know if you have ever heard this \u2013\nand this is something that is never been said on the air before i am going to sort of cross some lines here but i am not\ngoing to reveal my source and so that is the only thing i can\ndo here to protect the innocent so to speak but zecharia sitchin was actually channeling \u2013\nwhether people want to believe this or not \u2013 the anunnaki when\nhe was writing some of his books this is something that i was told\nconfidentially by one of our sources it just boggles the mind when you take that\ninto account and you look at the work that he is done it does\nmake logical sense because he is absolutely been prolific in\nthis particular area so one might say that in some ways you have to\nbe in some way psychically intuitively tuned to an era to a group\nof people to events and so on in order to even pursue it i think with any diligence and so perhaps there is something going on with\nthat in your own life but i wanted to throw that out just in case\nyou had never heard it yes thanks kerry i appreciate that and\nthat opens a very important door to me to be able to tell you that\ni have also channeled the anunnaki \u2013 not just on my own but in a whole group of people so it is not just me that can\nvouch for that i was fortunate enough to be visited by a very\nwell known psychic lady by the name of jackie that works in\njohannesburg jackie brought two groups of people here to adam\u2019s\ncalendar during the course of last year 2009 both times she had a\nchanneling which i was invited to after i told them everything i\nknew shared all my knowledge and information with them told them\nwhat i believed scientifically and what i believed intuitively and\nhow the two fit together i told them that i believe that the site was\nbuilt by enki and that his youngest son dumuzi was buried\nthere as well \u2013 and that is incidentally also referred to in\ngreat detail or in some detail in the lost book of enki and\nthe whole thing of inanna and dumuzi and how\nshe buried him \u201con the edge of\na cliff in the deep abzu i now believe that one of the sites at adam\u2019s\ncalendar is actually dumuzi\u2019s grave and how it is linked to the pyramids further in the valley by a\nbeautiful golden mean spiral and so forth so i went into this channeling and we actually\nchanneled enki and that is what i will michael\u2019s\nvoice is lost]\n\n\n\n\n  oh wow you are breaking up so i\nhope i am not losing you this is a fascinating story are you\nback michael yes i am here can you hear me yes well i think that some of the powers\nthat be are probably not happy with you saying that you guys are\nchanneling enki i think that this is probably true and i thank you\nvery much for coming forward with that have you been talking about\nthis in any other places of venues no this is the first time i have\nmentioned this anywhere to anyone wonderful so we actually channeled enki and he\nconfirmed everything that i intuitively felt and believed about the\nsite adam\u2019s calendar was commissioned and built by enki dumuzi is buried there at the site and\nit was built as the flagship and the centerpiece of his ancient\nbeloved lost city and he spoke in that channeling i actually have transcripts of that channeling\nwhich i can sort of somehow start making available when the time is\nright he talks about his ancient beloved city \u201chere\nin the deep abzu and how much\nhe loved it and that just also made me realize a few other\nthings because you know for a while well not a while for\nquite a long time i believed that the anunnaki were these disgusting\nmalicious people you know the humanoids that just abused the homo\nsapiens and so forth \u2013 and\nthat suddenly changed my perception of that changed and i am\nseeing things slightly differently now that is actually very fascinating i\nhave to say because in reading the lost\nbook of enki and finding out that\nsitchin was indeed channeling and also because we are going down\nthat road in camelot investigating some of the ets that are behind\nthe scenes \u2013 both the positive and the negative \u2013 in\nterms of influencing the powers that be to do what they are\ndoing today in other words this story is not over and i\nthink there are clues way-back-when in terms of what you are\ninvestigating what you are finding out the idea is also that there is a lot of\nconfusion around who the anunnaki were there is a confusion with\nreptilians there are people out there that are basically as you\nsaid they are having points of view in which in essence all the\nanunnaki are negative this and that and the other i myself have had a very stunning dream about\nwhat in essence seemed to me to be an anunnaki and certainly i\ndid not even believe that there could be beings that were as\ntall as they have been purported to be i know there are skeletons\nthat have been found around the world we also interviewed klaus\ndona are you familiar with klaus dona by the way i am not i must admit and i feel\nembarrassed to say that i am not no no it is no problem i thought i was well informed no i am sure you are\nactually we cannot all know everyone it is just that\nklaus dona is someone who has been on the circuit and we have done an\ninterview with him in vienna he is one of those people doing\nsimilar things to what you are in terms of ancient archeology that\nis not accepted by the mainstream we are going to a break we will be\nright back on this fascinating discussion on the other side of the\nhour end of part 1\n\nclick here for the audio interview \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nkerry\ncassidy (kc hi i am kerry cassidy a few months ago i had\nthe good fortune to interview dr leonard horowitz he is a well\nknown author and an expert on emerging diseases he wrote a book\nthat is i think most widely known emerging\nviruses aids and ebola recently\nhe talked to me for a short while about water and about the whole\nlive h2o\neffort and also about the health field and a myriad of other topics in a very short span of time i think that you will enjoy hearing\nfrom him here leonard\nhorowitz (lh hi my name is dr leonard horowitz and i have\nproduced about 16 books i have three national best sellers i deal\nwith subjects that are the worst\nof the worst news on the\nplanet and also the best of\nthe best news so\nif you really want to find out the sad reality regarding the genocide\nthat is ongoing under the guise of public health and national\nsecurity \u2013 the\nmilitary medical petrochemical pharmaceutical cartel\nand the industrialists that actually make money off of humanity\u2019s\nsuffering and control minds as well as populations as well as\npopulation reduction the\nworks that i have published include death\nin the air globalism terrorism and toxic warfare\nthat came out three months before september 11th the\nbook  emerging viruses aids and ebola nature accident or intentional that reverend jeremiah wright mentioned on national television in the\nheat of the barack obama campaign concerning the origin of aids and\nthe anglo-american thesis on how this is a genocidal weapon it is\nthe documentations that i published \u2013 literally us government\ndocuments contracts \u2013 in that book that enabled him and\nempowered him to make those claims so i have done a number of works in the field of public health overlapping national security central intelligence agency british\nsecret service currently if you go to www.fluscam.com you will see that i have uncovered the underlying truth\nconcerning the current flu pandemic and its implications and\nindicting baxter corporation as well as the company named novovax\n who in collaboration\nwith british officials at the uk as well as world health\norganizations think-tanks concerning viruses and vaccines for\ninfluenza dr robertson etc  these people are implicated in\nactually creating loosing the current flu that is circulating so that is the bad news the\ngreat news is that i am here in laguna beach today to honor dr masaru emoto who is a friend and a colleague who is my hero\nand a lot of peoples hero for creating this whole\nunderstanding of water live\nh2o concert\nfor the living water is\nabout celebrating all the knowledge the truths that have been\nsuppressed about water and water science that literally have the\ncapacity to free humanity completely\nfrom all the urgencies including the petrochemical pollution the\ndegradation of the environment we can turn to hydrogen and hydrogen\nfrom water for hydrogen fuel to run automobiles we\ncan turn to a product called oxysilver\nor silver hydrosols\nin general for literally presenting a nano-particle-sized silver bonded to water that is less than five parts per million that\ncan eliminate all\ninfectious diseases from planet earth and restore some semblance of\nsanity to what is currently the medical hypocrisy of intoxicating\nhumanity with foreign rna and dna from bacteria viruses fungus yeast chicken embryo bovine fetal serum monkey kidney tissues in\nthese things called vaccinations antibiotics\n\u2013 we can completely do away with antibiotics it is\ninteresting that we are conducting war against everything war anti-biosis anti-biology war against aids war against cancer war\nagainst all of these things well gee whiz why do not we do something pro proactively preventatively and positively probiotically and we can do that with the understanding that we are advancing\nin water and water science so\nit turns out that all of the greatest truths including what your dna\nactually does that is based on water is about to be revealed\nwith the concert for the\nliving water so\nmy work also deals with the best\nof the best there is in\nsolving the planet\u2019s worst problems and it is an honor\nand a privilege for me to join you today okay that is a great introduction very\ncomprehensive what do you think about how the global powers that be\nare going to deal with your solutions well the powers that be are obviously not supportive to coming out\nwith the truths that can emancipate humanity completely so they have\ndone a lot of suppression the\nmainstream mass-mind-control-enslaving-media is essentially largely\nto blame because we are supposed to have freedom of the press\nand now we have corporate control \u2013 multinational\ncorporate-controlled media and\nwe are supposed to have in fact in the united states a\nbalance of powers that is largely based on freedom of the press but unfortunately associated press and a couple of other news services\nprovide virtually 98% of the news if\nthey do not want to cover something  such as what the drug\nindustrialists and the petrochemical polluters do not want to\nhave revealed such as alternatives green technologies \u2013 well it gets suppressed so it is not likely that we are going\nto receive a lot of support from that domain but the great news is that it is a grass-roots initiative that\nthere is a decentralization of power that is happened with\nlive h2o concert for the\nliving water we\nhave over 70 venues internationally and it is still growing\ndaily all of those are organized and run and all the volunteers serving independent organizations that are not doing this for the\nmoney they are doing this because there is an urgency of\nneed at this time in history so this is a one-weekend event though is it not this is a one-weekend event live\nh2o is june 19th to the\n21st 2009 it is an historic event it is the most spiritually\nuplifting and important concert in earth\u2019s history it\nhas profound implications not just this weekend however it has\nongoing implications insofar as where\nare we going as a civilization where are we going as intelligent\npeople you\nknow we have had a lot of multi-national corporation officials\nchoose the path that we have followed so far and basically we\nhave not gotten too advanced we\ncall ourselves an \u201cadvanced\ncivilization but in\nfact i came back from new york last weekend on the front page of\nthe new yorker magazine\nwas literally a feature story entitled extinction\nof the human race and\nso we are really looking at a time in history where we have\ngot to make a choice and the choice has never been greater clearer and in fact either graver or more uplifting that\nchoice is simply are we\ngoing to tell the truth are we going to tell the ways and look at\nthe practical applications of what is called hydrosonics hydo\n\u2013 water sonics\n is sound frequency vibration that is the core creative\ntechnology if we want to recreate ourselves and recreate this\nplanet then what we have got to look at are those truths are you working with dr emoto on this technology yes dr emoto and i are long-term friends in fact i had the\nprivilege actually down here in orange county to have opened for\ndr emoto on the first lecture that he ever gave in the united\nstates on his first night in the united states with his first book\nin the united states i actually got the first autographed copy of\nthat book i showed it to dr emoto some years later and he was\nsurprised to actually see it but\ni have a water science mentor that was the same water science mentor\nthat dr masaru emoto had dr lee lorenzen he had a place in orange\ncounty and he developed the first structured\nwater so we really go way\nback now\nit is a privilege it is an honor for me to have witnessed\ndr emoto\u2019s great success all over the world but also to have\nbeen a small part in that success he\ncalls me his chief scientific validator and chief scientist involved\nin really looking at everything that he is doing and how it\nrelates to the most advanced fields of genetics electro-genetics water science frequency resonance bioenergetics looking at the\nhuman body \u2013 body water that is \u2013 as well as all the\nwater as a liquid-crystal super-conductor it is virtually the\ncreative juice of the universe what\ndr emoto\u2019s fantastic contribution is that  we all are just\nso thrilled to have him have made  is that this water this\nincredible creative juice has this intelligence it is\nliterally divine it is\nthat way in the bible it is talked about in the book of\ngenesis genesis 1-1 1-2 tells you in the beginning there was the\nwater even before the holy spirit is mentioned in the bible even\nbefore the word was spoken let\nthere be light there was\nthe water so water\u2019s really part of the triune god in theology in\njudeo-christian and muslim theology it is\nrevered by all of the cultures whether it is buddhism or indian\nhindu it is always consistent every culture hawaiian kahunas everyone the aboriginal people of australia they are all\ncelebrating with us this live\nh2o weekend because they\nall understand water is literally part of this divine substance this\nsustaining creative juice dr emoto\u2019s incredible work tells us that it is not only\nresponsive to our prayers \u2013 just like angels just like the\ncreator \u2013 but also this concept that it has a shifting\nof its actual structure which means it is not only intelligent but it changes its structure in such a way as to incredibly deliver\npersonal messages to us \u2013 messages that are very very\nimportant that speak to love that speak to planetary sustenance that speak to our own spiritual evolution and well-being as a\ncivilization so all of these wonderful contributions dr emoto has made we are\nhere tonight in laguna beach california to celebrate okay well do you consider yourself a healer this question is do i\nconsider myself a healer i\nwould say that pretty much all of us are really healers when it gets\nright down to it you know this\nconcept for example of the living water being in each of us and\nthis concept that jesus best demonstrated how he healed people\nmiraculously was through his faith and trust whenever he performed\nthese miraculous healings he would always tell everybody it is\nby your faith and trust that you are healed so\nfaith and trust and prayer \u2013 the spoken word which is very\npowerful the creative technology \u2013 and this heartfelt loving\nintention to produce a blessing is not unique to jesus it is\nnot unique to len horowitz it is not unique to dr masaru\nemoto in fact it is in every single one of you and it is\nreally a basic fact so i think we are all natural healers i\nthink right now we are engaged in a time of revealing that great\ntruth and then getting beyond the mind control the dumbing down of\nthe population to make us believe that we have got to pop magic\npills to cure every ill how totally absurd how we think that we have\ngot to get vaccinated in order to have immuno-capacity to resist\ninfectious diseases that is insane in\nfact all the science is actually showing that the most deadly of all\nof the diseases is iatrogenesis it is\nphysician-induced illnesses brought on by faith and trust in what i\ncall medical deities you know mds it is paganism the bible\ntalks about that and\nbasically the bible stories are full of times when pagans got\njudgment day coming you know they got what they sowed as\nyou sow so shall you reap so where you place your faith and trust is extremely important in\nthis age so are you saying that you believe in judgment day i believe that judgment day is happening every day as a matter of\nfact right now we know when we look at dr emoto\u2019s work in\nwater and water science that what this incredibly miraculous vibrating liquid-crystal super-conductor really is it is a\njudgment apparatus judgment is like karma it is the concept of\nwhat goes around comes\naround as you sow so shall you reap well if you sow for example negativity if you sow anger and\nresentment hostility even sadness and depressed articulations and\nfeelings through your words that sound resonance energy actually\nimpacts every single water molecule in your body \u2013 instantly so judgment is instantaneous all\nof this is incredibly just basic understanding from the magnificent\nwork that dr emoto has done to reveal the consciousness in water the way that water responds to prayer that water responds to words\nsuch as i love you\nor i hate you or it responds to beautiful music heartfeltly rendered in a way for\nhealing \u2013 versus some completely dissonant energy vibration\nfrom the most unconscious types of music that literally break\nthe structures of water break the sacred geometry \u2013 that has\nnow been shown to be produced in response to heartfelt loving\nintention and blessedness okay i know you are a doctor by profession right yes i have three doctorates actually i have a doctorate in\nmedical dentistry from tufts university i taught on the faculties of\ntufts at harvard university i spoke on behavioral science issues\nand microanatomy \u2013 it is called histology \u2013 and i\ntaught dental as well as medical students i have a masters in public\nhealth from harvard my\narea of special expertise beyond emerging diseases is in behavioral\nscience looking at the way the mainstream media manipulates peoples minds to literally dumb us down and engage us into these deceptions\nthat end up costing our lives really so you are saying you specialized in media as a part of\nbehavioral science because that is not actually what behavioral\nscience is involved with that is right i specialize mostly in behavioral science media health education health promotion i see yes so did you go through sort of a transition or a trajectory in\nyour own journey your own personal journey that sort of changed the\nway you approached the medical field oh i did i went through my own personal journey that was pretty\nintense having lost a mother to a vaccination and ultimately did not even know it when it was happening i had to find out\nlater that it was just hideous the\nflu vaccines that they are even pumping out right now and\ntelling us they are so necessary in fact the urgency right\nnow is people need to wake up immediately because the barack obama\nadministration is about to legislate every american getting three flu\nshots this coming fall 2009 so we had better wake up i\nwoke up too late it cost my mother her life and in fact tens of\nthousands of americans who received the 1976 swine flu vaccine ended up with guillain-barre an auto-immune disease  that was\ndevastating and\nso this is what my mother received and at the time i did not\neven know in fact at the time that she was dying i was engaged in\neducating as a public health professional the standard education\nthat we all received in dental medical public health education is\nthat vaccines are safe and effective i\nwas actually teaching that and so i am likely responsible for\nthousands of nurses and physicians and dentists and hygienists to\nactually have them develop auto-immune diseases from inoculations of\nthe hepatitis b vaccine that i heavily promoted as literally\nsomebody who\u2019d been brainwashed hmm well i understand that you actually took your daughter out of\nschool recently to avoid a vaccination is not that right actually specifically it was the tuberculosis skin test i took my\nchildren out of school in hawaii and we are not even living in\nhawaii anymore we are\nboycotting living in hawaii because it is a completely barbaric and\nfascist state over there whereby they literally do not even allow\nanyone any child even in private schools to enter school without a\ntuberculosis skin test \u2013 which is virtually the same as\nvaccination it is the same in terms of injecting into your\nbloodstream foreign proteins and foreign dna and rna  in this case the tuberculosis bacillus\nfragments and\nso this wheal reaction\nthat they call a positive\ntest actually is a systemic\nreaction they hide that fact and so i did not want to give my\nchildren anything that would violate the sanctity of their holy\nspiritual temples i honor my children they are\nvery healthy without ever having been vaccinated against anything we\npractice natural medicine we are very conscious about what we\neat what we drink and how we live our lives ideally minimizing\nstress and\nso what we have chosen to do is pull our children out of this unfortunately indoctrination system that has been going under the\nguise of education are you going to be staying in the united states with codex coming\ndown i think codex alimentarius legislation is going to impact everybody\nworldwide the concept is \u2013 quote unquote \u2013\n\u201charmonization for the entire planet under the guise of\n\u201chealth and safety it is\nactually a mechanism to regulate access to all botanicals natural\nhealing remedies the homeopathics vitamins minerals supplements\n everything having to do with natural health and healing it is\npart of this global industrial manipulation of the population and the\ndecimation of our rights our freedoms one of those freedoms is the\nright to god\u2019s bounty and nature\u2019s bounty and that you\nknow the bible is full of revelations and verses that talk about how\nthe healing of\nthe nations shall come by\nthe leaves and the trees that line the banks of the water the living water which are our bloodstreams so all around us we\nhave all of these beautiful natural healing remedies i\nwork as an ambassador for the world organization of natural medicine and the project that is really dear to my heart and  many of my\ncolleagues hearts is the clinics for humanity project where\nall over the world we are establishing natural healing clinics and\ninviting residents to come and learn natural healing and serve in\nthese places voluntarily at\nthe end of six years after studying in rigorous curriculums that are\non the internet right now we can certify their natural medicine\ndegree and get them to the place where they can then become\nboard-certified then licensed in a certain state and then practice\nnatural medicine as naturopathic physicians so this is really important if we do not do it now this concept\nof natural healing and the wisdom of the elders and the natural\nmethods of the holy medicine men and women that will be gone\nforever it is vitally important for our children and our\nchildren\u2019s children to sustain this brilliant wisdom okay but how is codex going to affect that codex alimentarius legislation is intending to eliminate your access\nto all of the natural medicinals as i mentioned the homeopathics the vitamins the minerals the supplements how will it affect the people graduating from your program that\nyou are talking about will they be able to practice oh i see i get your question well in terms of the people that i\nam working with who are advancing the certification program for world\norganization of natural medicine the concept is that these people\nare going to be operating as sovereigns for\nexample they are going to be entitled to practice medicine outside\nthe typical statutory laws that really violate god\u2019s laws and\nso it requires a whole different level of jurisdiction of\nlegislative recognition that is\nwhat we are working on on various levels various governments our latest \u201cwins have been in the country of lebanon and\nmany of the sadly\n\u2013 i speak as a christian jew and an american \u2013 sadly i\nhave to tell you that the most advanced countries in the world are\nthose muslim nations those arabic nations who understand that what\nwe are looking at here is an anglo-american genocidal operation\nthat codex alimentarius is actually advancing it is\na regulation of our basic fundamental understanding of health of\ndivinity how it can impact humanity natural ways of remedying all\nof the urgencies you\nknow this is really what we have got to support so that is\none of the things that we are doing with live\nh2o concert for the living water\non behalf of our co-sponsor world organization for natural medicine to advance this understanding and gratitude literally for all of the\npeople in the muslim world who understand that this is indeed a\nholy war it is\na holy war when you think of the fact that we are spiritual beings\nand that to keep from us these natural remedies that the creator had\nmeant to give us so that we can sustain ourselves \u2013 that is a\nspiritual attack and that is what codex alimentarius\nlegislation is that is\nwhat this whole flu vaccination campaign really is about it is\nreally about intoxicating with the number one foremost genocidal\nweapon \u2013 vaccination \u2013 the entire global population and\nthere are a lot of people that are not going to go along with it okay so what is your solution you said something about becoming\nsovereign on the part of the natural practitioners you are\ntalking about seceding\nfrom actual us citizenship and doing all of that yes i have colleagues i am not an expert in that field and\ni would highly urge everybody to study with some good experts in this\nfield once\nyou do your eyes open you begin to realize gee\nwhiz you know how did i get my birth certificate what does my\nbirth certificate really mean what does my social security number\nreally mean what\nis it connected to financially in the global unity core in the\nglobal exchange system the uniform commercial code and the systems\nof \u201claws that really govern how money operates and how\nwe operate in a jurisdiction of commercial law so\nthese are very important areas of study you know rather than\nscience and mathematics and even reading writing and arithmetic in\ngrade school we really should be taught number one fundamentally\nwho we are as human beings what\nis our connection to the living god you know how does god live in\nus and how does god operate in us and you know what is this whole field of metaphysics all about how come\nsome people are completely psychic how did they get that way what\nfacilitates that how\ncan leonardo da vinci his complete creative genius i\nam the author of the book love the real da vinci code where i have decrypted the real da vinci code in his famous\ndrawing the vitruvian woman there is a woman behind the man in\nthat famous drawing with four arms four legs and a head and\nthat is really who we are we are engaged in a cosmic balance\nthat is mathematically musically harmonically administered and\nthat is all happening because of water and sound \u2013 frequency\nvibration \u2013 which is mathematics that is\nvitally important knowledge you know not just the\ntruth that shall set us free but the greatest truths including know\nthyself what\nare the greatest truths about you and how do you then take those\nmagnificent truths those sacred truths and wisdom and apply it in\nyour daily lives that is\na book that we should be getting when we become parents in how to\nraise rear a child and be response-able truly responsibility for\nanother human being we should have a manual on how to take care of\nthat human being and a definition of what that human being really is\nall about and\nso that is what we are engaged in right now it is a\nwhole transcendence it is a whole paradigm shift it is a\nwhole spiritual renaissance it is a celebration ultimately of\nhumanity\u2019s finest revelations but what about the political situation in other words if your\nsolution is sovereignty do you think that the government is actually\ngoing to go along with that of course not if the solution is sovereignty the governments and\nthe drug industrialists \u2013 what i call the military medical petrochemical pharmaceutical cartel \u2013 are not going to go\nalong with that because everything that they are doing is\nengaged in just the opposite a complete enslavement from\nbirth to grave you are regulated intoxicated manipulated mass mind-controlled and that is ultimately something that is one of\nthe truths that shall set us free \u2013 just the recognition of\nthat you\nknow before you can practice medicine you have got to\nunderstand diagnosis the word itself says it all diagnosis to know through the seeing-through to the root cause that is\nwhat the word means so\nin order for us to treat ourselves and treat our social pathology we have got to really see through to the root cause of it all right and really there\u2019re some fabulous simple truths now that are\nextremely uplifting that live\nh2o concert for the living water\nand everything that is written on the concert website \nhttps www.liveh2o.org is going to be revealing and people are celebrating\ninternationally the revelations so you are interested in changing consciousness obviously in\npart through this event that you are taking part in but what\ni am wondering is what is your solution for people that are\nfacing this codex coming down sometime i believe in january of\n2010 well quite frankly if you ask me what my solution is to codex\nalimentarius and this global manipulation of the population the\nanswer is we do not have an answer the creator has an answer i\nbelieve i have some awareness of what the creator has in store for\nhumanity it would probably take us another half an hour for me to\nlay it out for you but\nthe reality is i do not think most people clearly most\npeople are not prepared to even hear the answer most people think\nthat the answer is silly or foolish conspiracy nonsense and\nso i can see as anybody whose eyes are open to the current reality\nthat the future does not bode well for most people on this planet the\nanswer then lies not so much in the physical reality that is\ngoing on here but literally in the transcendence of that and the\npurification and the spiritual uplifting \u2013 virtually the\nemancipation of the burdened spirit that we all now have coming out\nof this cult-ture this american medical or global manipulative cult-ture which we have been raised in and we have established the\nbeliefs and the behaviors consistent with that manipulation and\nindoctrination come\nout of her my people lest ye be infected by her plagues that is virtually a quote from jesus so the reality is that you have got to come out of it completely and there are ways  intelligently reasonably responsibly  to\ncome out of this hypocrisy one of those ways is not going to get\nvaccinated and it is not going to medical deities to solve\nevery flu or every cancer that you have got going on there is\na whole other realm again when we talk about faith simple faith and spirituality and\nmetaphysical dynamics and how all of metaphysics can now be\nbeautifully explained through mathematics as well as this\nhydrosonics \u2013 sound vibration on water \u2013 that is\nwhat we are celebrating this weekend okay and you know it sounds like you are aware of the et\nvisitation on the planet you are not actually talking about\nthat at the moment but certainly there is an et element that is\nbeen involved in what is going down here on the planet are you\npart of sort of the philosophy that believes that we are going to\nbe moving into the fourth dimension oh that is a\nbeautiful question with regard to my view of extraterrestrial\nexistence and whether currently we are engaged in this process in a spiritual renaissance sense of moving into another dimension absolutely i absolutely firmly believe that in my heart and you are\nlistening to me say that after years of me being really unsure you\nknow i have been criticized and somewhat ostracized by the ufo\ncommunity because part of my lecture has been saying you know as a\nbehavioral science expert i can tell you that what we are\nwitnessing on this planet is not normal human behavior we are\nreally not witnessing genocide as anything that represents love and\nempathy and compassion as we have most of us in our hearts so there is a distinct difference somehow a human being and\nanother entity are at vast ends of a spectrum of how to care for each\nother or collaborate and you know the fact is that because i have been looking at it\nmore from a behavioral scientist\u2019s perspective and then have\nhad to come to the conclusion that it is not normal human\nbehavior subsequent to that i have now realized through\npersonal revelations and experiences that we are dealing with\nthe spiritual realm here we are\nreally dealing with the realm of the angels and now i have\nexperienced a lot of that and so i have matured a bit i now can\ntell you that it is exactly as jesus said it\nis not against flesh and blood with whom we do battle there are\nbattles going on and\nthen you know i also go back into my love for the bible and the old\ntestament to the nephilim the fallen angels and the elohim the\nmultiple gods when the creator said to his friends he says hey\nguys let us\nmake man in our image that is in the torah so basically it obviously recognizes that there are other lesser gods there are spiritual entities the nephilim genesis tells us outlive\nthe flood those are the fallen angels the herculeans the super-men\nand so do you believe that they are going to return soon do i believe that the nephilim well i do not have any opinion on whether or not the nephilim\nare going to return soon i\nthink that a lot of what i am witnessing in government\nmalfeasance official malfeasance and the manipulation at the\nhighest levels of government it is obvious that those people\nare very dark they have got a lot of dark energy and so are\nthese super-men are they aliens you know it is really kind of\nlike an academic question the\nmore important question is what are we going to do about it right\nnow to facilitate this extremely beautiful and blessed expansion of\nour own love our own hearts our own transcendence of the physical\nmanipulations you\nknow it is a complete miracle and you know grace of god that\nwe are still alive\nhere we have been so polluted \u2013 drinking fluoride in the\nwater chlorine in the water the food is contaminated the\npesticides in the foods and the water supplies the hormones that\nhave been injected into the chickens and into the beef  all of\nthese ways that we have been intoxicated  the air that we are\nbreathing chemtrail spray pesticide spray it is\nreally a miracle\nthat we are still here so there is obviously a truth and a very high wisdom to we physical\nbeings come out of the spirit and so for literally salvation\u2019s\nsake physical salvation\u2019s sake we have got to move\ninto that spirit and\ni believe that is what the christian concept of rapture\nreally is about that is what i believe when jesus said that you will be on\nthe earth but no longer of\nit that is\nwhat i believe he was talking about that metaphysically now we are\nadvancing opening our hearts getting into the frequency vibration\nof divinity to bless humanity maximally that\nwill sustain us and nothing more okay well thank you very much len horowitz this has been quite\nan encapsulation but very very very well done you are a very\ngood speaker and i appreciate all the energy that you put into this what\ni had love to do is invite you onto our radio show it is\nobvious that you have areas where we could drill down into some of\nthe things you have done in the past some of your understanding\nof the global situation in various countries what is going on\nthere i had\nlove to talk to you about africa in more depth i had like to\nhear what your thoughts are about europe about what is going on\nin europe versus what is going on in the us china you know \nthe different areas of the world because not everywhere is actually experiencing this sort of shift we are\ngoing through in the same way and at the same pace if you will so i think that that is actually sort of becoming the question of\nthe day with the dollar being actually thrown out it is as if\nthe us is being targeted to go down first if you will and i had\nlove to hear your thoughts on that sure i had be happy to join you okay great all right thank you very much it is a pleasure intro dr pete peterson (pp it is\nan area that is very highly defendable that was very important\nbecause of my belief and the belief of many other people that i have\ngreat respect for that the world is going through a i will\ncall it a meltdown once\nthe people found out what had done to them by their representatives they felt that it would be much better for their health and safety to\nbe somewhere else my\nunderstanding it was the third-ever closed session of congress we\nfound that no matter where the politician was and what committee he\nwas on when top secret things were talked about they wanted to\nclose the session early so they could get out and put their tips out\nto the news we do not have any confidentiality in that it\nleaked out i am sure am i right in assuming that you would not contradict those\nleaks i would not contradict them at all thank you beginning of interview bill\nryan (br this is bill ryan and kerry cassidy from project camelot\nand this is monday june the 29th 2009 and this is a project\ncamelot interview with a difference because not only have i flown the\nbest part of 8,000 miles \u2013 at least it feels like if it is not\nquite that many \u2013 from europe to be here for the weekend but\nwe are also here with david wilcock who has also flown from los\nangeles here for the weekend to join us in a meeting that we had\nwith dr pete peterson who is a name that not many people will\nknow but may be \u2013 among the many extraordinary whistleblowers\nand contacts and researchers and scientists who we have had the great\npleasure of talking to \u2013 may be one of the most important yesterday\nwe were talking off-record for the best part of twelve hours and our\nminds are still digesting an enormous amount of extraordinary\ninformation that he shared with us some of which is off-record as\nmuch as possible pete is willing to put on record here on camera because you feel do not you pete that there is a profound and\nimportant reason why the sort of people who will be watching this\nvideo need to hear what it is that you have to say we\nwant to salute you because you are a very brave man one of the things\nwe want to ask you straight off the cuff is why is it that you feel\nthat you wanted to put some of your almost unbelievable and very\nimportant testimonies on camera for a lot of people to listen to and\nwatch and understand at this time why is it that you have come forward\nand you are talking to us now dr pete peterson (pp well i think the main reason for that is i have\nhad an inside insight for many many years having been picked up in\nvarious programs to do things for the government since i was 13 years\nold being a problem-solver i wish i could say that it was hard work\nand so forth but i come from a long line of inventors on both sides\nof my family tree and people who graduated from school very early\nand were significant in affecting things that affected humanity a\nnumber of them in virtually every kind of field and climate i\nsee that the world seems to have gone downhill i am aware of many\nprograms to remove intelligence from people and return the people at\nleast of this nation to a mediocre status we have watched\nthe school systems deteriorate we have watched the as my wife likes\nto say the program in the school systems no\nchild left with a mind that is\nher paraphrase for it and\ni have seen that the type of government we have though i am a patriot\nand very crudely use the phrase that i\ngot the flag tattooed on both cheeks of my fanny the hard way i\nspent ten years in the marine corps and a great part of that was in\ncombat and combat zones and other things i did for the government i\nlike to think i am unique in that i was probably shot at on most\ncontinents anyway what i see happening is a complete turn away from the way this\ncountry started out and in its constitution to what appears to be\nheaded toward a socialistic system where reason and logic has no\nbearing it\nconcerns me i have no idea if my voice can help i have no idea if\nthat can but i know that my ideas i have ideas i have inventions\nthat have proven to be very helpful to society many of them have\nbeen suppressed by the fact that we had a government that was run by\nindustry rather than by the people it is turned away from that and\nmany industries are actually governed by rules and regulations that\nmake it virtually impossible for them to exist if they do things that\nare good for humanity for\nexample we have had numerous things that have happened in the industry\nof alternative power that were very inexpensive very capable but\nwhat we do is we have through their own legislation limited the power\ncompanies to being able to charge a certain amount over and above\ntheir costs so when their costs went down their profit went down\nand they could not economically operate what i would love to ask you about pete before we go into some of\nthe stories that you have to tell \u2013 and we have good reason to\nbelieve that having spent the best part of twelve hours yesterday\ntalking about a tiny fraction of your experience i think that we\ncould probably talk literally for days  \u2013 what the people\nwatching this video are really concerned about i think is what can\nyou help them understand better than they do at the moment about\nwhat is really happening on this planet at the moment what are the\nagendas of the controllers how much trouble are we in and what can\npeople do and\ni want to put that question on hold because this is the purpose of\nthis video as far as we are concerned there is\na whole separate topic which is a technological topic because this\nman we are talking to now has told us about technology that we did not\nknow existed my brain is still reeling over a conversation that we\nhad at breakfast this morning about which i am going to say nothing now before we start all of that \u2013 and that was a wonderful overview\nthat you gave about your intentions \u2013 can you give us a little\nbit of a timeline of your career history which started when you were\nvery young a little bit about the kind of things you have been\ninvolved in we are not asking you to name names but we just want to\npresent you as somebody who people can get some kind of an idea of\nwho this person is that we are talking to whose name they have not\nheard before well i can do that a very interesting thing we were talking\nabout i have no idea where these thoughts came to me but i know\nthat very early on in life i was so different from the people around\nme that i thought that probably i fell from the sky in a titanium egg\nand landed in my grandfather\u2019s orchard and my parents found me\nthere and i think you are probably right actually having talked to you\nfor two days until i was about 22 i actually believed that david\nwilcock (dw he is\nreal he is solid then i quit believing that when i was in my mid-20s and in my last\nfew years \u2013 i am nearly 70 \u2013 and in my last few years i have started believing that again because i find that the people i am\nstuck with here on this little spaceship earth do not seem to have the\nsame view of anything it may be that i am just wacky but my wackiness has made a lot of\nproducts and made a lot of sense to a number of people throughout my\nlife for\nsome reason i well it is probably genetics because on both\nof my parents sides i have long lines of geniuses that extend\nback in history i grew up in a home that was entirely powered and\nheated and cooled in a very temperate climate was powered by the\nsun and by atmospheric pressure change it was a home that had a\ngallery inside of it much like mexican haciendas but was covered where we grew all of our meat products in the form\nof chickens and rabbits and such and where we grew all of our food\nproducts so you had an interesting and unusual upbringing i had an interesting and unusual upbringing we drove in cars that\nmy father made and invented we lived in homes that my father built\nout of strange materials that were very highly insulated my dad was\na pioneer in tilt-up concrete buildings and was an engineer for the\nmilitary in my youth through the second world war and you were hand-picked and chosen for a special program when you\nwere as young as 13 is this correct yes i distinguished myself at age 10 by building a number of\nrockets that held world altitude records and by inventing a material\nthat is used even today to power solid-fuel rockets that material got\nout of my hands because i am not a businessman and was not a\nbusinessman and freely gave it away and other people capitalized on\nit but i liked explosions and so early on started building\nrockets there is a wonderful story that you told us yesterday that we had love\nto say again very briefly i am going to be using the word briefly\nin my\nquestions here with an apology because we know that you could talk\nwith us literally for days about the extraordinary experiences\nyou have had the things that you know the things you have been told the things that you strongly believe with good reason but one of the\nstories that we wanted you to tell is what happened one day when you\nwere ten years old with a bunch of adults and you had an\nextraordinary experience well i will preface that just a little bit with the fact that as i\nwas growing up it was in a very small country town about three\nblocks long and not a lot of people my parents had a home that had a\nformal garden and many of the local people would borrow that for\nweddings and family reunions and things like that which my parents\ngladly lent them the facilities there was a wedding that went on\nand as i remember it was kind of in maybe june or july of 1950 at\nthat point i had very limited educational resources in this tiny\ntown but one of the books that got me very very interested in\nancient peoples and anthropology and archeology was the book that was\nwritten about the discovery of king tut's tomb about the time i\nfinished that book it got me very very excited to learn about the\negyptians and learn about the technologies that they had and who\nthey were and how they built the pyramids a lecturer came to town the man who wrote the book kon-tiki thor heyerdahl then that got me excited so i decided i wanted to be\nan anthropologist-archaeologist and was dead set on it and reading\neverything i could get through the state library system on that\nsubject along\ncame this wedding and just about as the preacher was to say the\nwords of destruction to the bride and groom someone pointed up to\nthe sky and said what is\nthat and\neveryone turned around \u2013 there were about 130 people there \u2013\neveryone turned around and looked and for the next two hours\neveryone at the wedding watched a series and groups of what i can\nonly call flying saucers flying through the air \u2013 some as close\nas maybe 100 feet and some as far away as maybe 20 miles \u2013\nput on a spectacular show everyone there saw it as did many people\nin the surrounding community were they all the same no there were very different ones some were the shape of a pencil\nand seemed to have windows along the periphery some were round like\na ball some were saucer-shaped with a bubble or a dome on top some\nsaucer-shaped with two or three bubbles on the bottom if you go back\nand look through the various flying saucer sightings that we have\nheard about over the years there was probably one or two of\neverything we have ever heard about these things would\ndash away clear out of sight and come back they would run away from\nthe people at the wedding party directly so you were looking just at\none spot and the significance of this is that at this point you made a\nmajor life change right at this point i made a major life change i decided i was much less\ninterested in king tut than i was in having my own flying saucer right so immediately started studying science i have studied science\never since much of it toward the end of building my own flying\nsaucer over the years i came to the conclusion that to build a\nflying saucer you really needed to know first how to build what i\ncall a doctor\nwho phone booth for\nthose who do not know dr who was a british science fiction\nspoof that runs on many stations in america about 1:00 am to 2:00 am and there\u2019ve been something like six or seven different dr who is\nover the years it is run so long dr who had a red british\nphone booth he did not have a red british phone booth he had a black\npolice phone box it was a police\nphone\nbox it was not a red one ah okay alright he had a two-holer british phone booth and he\nwould go into it and it would become a time machine it was called the tardis it was called the tardis so he was a time lord and he would travel\nback and forth in both space and time so as i tried to figure out\nhow to build a flying saucer i found out it was easier to build a\ntardis then i got thinking well who wants to just shove an aerodynamic body through air when you can\njust simply get somewhere and dial your destination and walk out\nwhere you are and you do not have to push anything through the\nair anyway i worked toward that end and have done many many science projects some for large corporations some for \u2013 we will call them\n\u201cagencies and many of them for myself i am\nin the process now at age 69 of building a laboratory to complete\nthe work that i have done and having acquired a number of very\nspecial pieces of equipment for researching such things so\nthat is what i am about right now i am in the process\nof building that laboratory in a remote location where there are very\nlittle man-made magnetic fields we do not really get television\nor radio direct much here and have very very little man-made\ninterference \u2013 electromagnetic interference \u2013 and it\nallows me to do my work that i need to do so that is the life\nchange that happened when i was ten years old and so i have been\non that pursuit ever since and we would say be\ncareful what you wish for because\nnow you have the understanding as far as you have told us in our\nconversations so far you have actually the understanding if you\ndo not have the factory to actually be able to make these\nmachines you can also confirm that the powers that be on planet\nearth actually have access to this technology and use it for all\nkinds of reasons is this correct as far as i can tell there are a number of governments that have\nthis technology my feeling is and/or my knowledge is that it is\nbeen acquired from people who came to this planet from off planet and it is been from the reading of a lot of ancient documents\ndating back as far as 6,000 years to the sumerians to the sumerians i have a sumerian document that is been\ntranslated that tells exactly how to build a flying saucer and it is\na direct translation it probably does not give everything but\nit certainly gives the principles and i have experimented with a\nnumber of those principles and find out that things take place that\nin modern physics are not possible i have\nworked with a group of scientists that have recently discovered\nthings in both mathematics and science that would lead me to believe\nthat the greater part of science that we have today \u2013 and i\nhave a phd degree in natural philosophy which they used to call\nphysics that took a lot of effort to acquire \u2013 and it leads me\nto believe that these ancient documents portray knowledge that we\nsimply do not have and that the knowledge we do have is wrong and you have been privileged to spend time in the vatican\nlibrary is this something you can talk about on record uh probably well i can talk about things that there is a lot\nof information there that is very contrary to things that we believe\nvery deeply both philosophically and scientifically and that is\nbasically been held away from the public \u2013 it is not\ncommon knowledge \u2013 a lot of translations which i think probably came from the remnants of what did not burn in the\ngreat library of alexandria very ancient documents i\nwas involved for a time with machine language translation of a lot\nof that material which was in those days somewhat crude but at\nleast it gave us some ideas and the ones that looked good were later\ntranslated by people who had done you know lifetime studies of the\nlanguage and i think they are pretty fair translations are you able to say anything about anything that you learned about\nthe anunnaki or is this off-record as well well the anunnaki who are written about in the christian and\njewish bible texts there are i have seen skeletons of what\nwe call giants there\u2019ve\nbeen recent giants they are you know people that would travel\naround with traveling circuses and so forth that were very very\nlarge through genetic problems that they had genetic errors all of\nthem had joint problems they had organ problems they died young the bodies could not support the weight things like that but\nsome of the skeletons do not show those anomalies that one would\nsee they are very well-formed they are very much like our\nskeletons in many respects they were written about in the bible and\nthey were written about in other ancient texts so one has to\nbelieve i\nknow that there were numerous suggestions that dna tests be run on\nthem once we got dna testing pretty well down and i know those have\nbeen thwarted by various religions and various school bodies people\nnot wanting to say that there are things that we do not\nunderstand or that they do not understand or that they do not\nwant\nto\nunderstand but we human beings are from et lineage  are we not my belief is that i will give you an example radio carbon\ndating has become very very accurate we have very good records of\ncave men that did not have a language some drew pictures some\ndid not we found caves with their tools in them with the\nevidences of their civilization with their making crude tools and\nthings there\u2019ve been a number of spots that those were found especially in africa and europe and the middle east then all of a sudden over an 80-year period emerged a civilization that for 3,000 years had the same language and the same religion and the\nsame writing and the same mathematics and was very very advanced\nfrom things that came afterward and you know in modern history\nsince oh let us say 300 bc we have not had any\ncivilization that did not change the language to where you\ncould not read it in a 300-year period sure yeah now many of the viewers of this video will be aware of\nthe influence on ancient sumeria where this fully-developed\ncivilization seemed to appear from nowhere i was just asking whether\nyou can confirm in any way what a lot of people suspect which is\nthat we actually are have been created or engineered by ets who\nknew what they were doing and who wanted to create us for special\npurposes well i do not have absolute proof of that that is one\nreason i am building the laboratory here but one of the things\ni did notice in the late \u201870s and early \u201880s i did a\nlot of medical equipment engineering and i designed a machine that\nwould read a field that surrounded the human body and could give you\na read-out on the condition of the organs organ by organ in the\nbody then it could locate or find or even create a medication that\nwould fix it one of the things that i found was in the early\nbeginning that that machine could pretty accurately come up with a\ndiagnosis rate of 50 percent of course i wanted it\nto be perfect and spent a number of years finding out that the reason\ni did not get over 50 percent was because a lot of people had\ngenetic errors in their genetic system as a result of that they had\ndisease processes that were based on those genetic errors so you had\nto treat them very different  these people who had a disease that\nwas based on virii or germs or other parasites especially so\ni finally got it to where about 70 to 75 percent of the diagnoses\nappeared correct and the selection of medication treatment appeared\ncorrect then i thought well okay there is 25 percent here that i really do not\nunderstand it\nwas about oh ten or fifteen years later that we got pretty familiar\nwith and pretty good with genetic testing and i found that that 15\npercent of people had very very similar sequences in the dna that\nwere unlike the other 85 percent of the people \u2013 and they were\nunlike anything else on earth they appeared to be alien to the\nearth so i thought well that well could be through exposure to some form of solar radiation\nor some type of ionizing radiation so\nwe looked at people that lived in areas that had natural radioactive\ncompounds like the areas in southern utah where a lot of the\ncarnotite and other uranium-bearing ores were mined and people that\nspent time there people that were in fallout zones of nuclear\ntesting at the nuclear test center in nevada ed\nnote a video splice begins here on a different topic]\n\n\nwe\nsent the gemini capsule up and it went up \u2013 the first capsule\nthat went up \u2013 so we are all sitting in mission control\nand called up and you know ground\nto capsule ground to capsule hello do you read us pete\nmakes noise like muffled radio communication comes back and there\nwas dead silence and then everybody laughed because we had the thing the last guy that went to work had to be the guy that ran for lunch and right down the street from jpl right above the rose bowl was\nlike one the first jack-in-the-boxes and you had drive in and\nyou had order and they had repeat order back and it would\ncome back  and you\ncould not hear a word so everybody realized that these\nastronauts had taken their turn going and getting lunch and\netcetera etcetera and everybody laughed and thought they were\nsimulating the jack-in-the-box effect it\nturns out that that was the best communication that we had so\nimmediately chris kraft turns to me and says peterson solve this problem so i made a thing that we eventually called the \u201clecture\nlaundry and it was a device that found out why such things\ntook place and they still take place you still go to drive-ins and\nyou cannot understand a darn thing but\ni built some no-noise microphones that also had a device that removed\nall of that problem we found out that there are three narrow pass\nbands for all the information as speech is recorded two\nof them record the information one of them gives you the\nidentification of the speaker but that one pass band that gives you\nthe speaker identification has to have a variable frequency start\u2013up\nand drop-off so you have little knob on it so you turn it on in a\nlecture  and turn this knob until you can\nhear the speaker very very clearly and you can hear them perfectly you do not hear the airplanes go over the police cars go by people shuffling their papers the noise from the cooling fan the\nnoise from the rear projection fan etcetera etcetera etcetera so\nanyway it is one of the little things out of my life but i\nused to build those and when i moved to build my new laboratory nine\nyears ago i quit building those so that is one of the products\ni intend to get put back into production ed\nnote end video splice here the 15% alien dna topic resumes i\nchecked to see why i could not get the final 15 percent of the\ndiagnostic readings correct and finally came to the conclusion that\nit was because these people had dna that had come from off planet that led me to think well if that is the case there must be some kind of historical\nrecord and\nwhen i went back and looked at the historical record i found out\nthat there are numerous records and archaeological evidence that we\nwere visited by people from off planet \u2013 very probably in my\nopinion not only off planet but extraterrestrial or\nextra-solar-system-type of visitors you\nknow there is so many different people that claim having seen\nsuch things that they existed seen such peoples there are several\nbroad categories of such aliens a few a small percentage of those could be attributed to anything from paranoia to just tall tales or\nwhatever but when you have as many as there are all the way down\nthrough all of recorded history it leads one to believe that it\nprobably was very very true that such things existed as\nan example anyone who wants to find something from the past read\nezekiel in the bible in the course of your work have you encountered any documentation\nabout the existence of our relationship with creatures like that i have most of them i cannot talk about sure but yes i have seen things written by scientists that i have\nvery high respect for some were teachers of mine some were people\nthat i work with scientifically in other fields and there were\ncasual conversations about such things that is why i have the\nbeliefs that i have that we have extraterrestrial dna in our\nbodies some of us do it is\nrather interesting to note that there is been a lot of\nsupposition about various programs to reprogram people\u2019s minds to throw their thinking off to cause them to believe things that\nare not necessarily true but politically would be a very good\nthing for those in politics and in government and in religion it is\ninteresting to note that mind control techniques work on 85 percent\nof the people and the 15 percent that they do not work well on\nare people that have that particular dna string ah-ha okay so just another verification that those people are very different\nfrom the average person pete i am sure we are going to have tons of people\nwanting to know of this 15 percent dna category is it all one type\nof person like one race or are they distributed throughout the\npopulation and if you cannot tell us you cannot tell us no they obviously run in family trees along family tree lines or\nfamily lines but they are pretty well distributed throughout\nall different cultures and races thank you i thought that was the case but i wanted that on record which again would be to me a confirmation that that probably did\nhappen because why would someone come and select just one race or one\nfamily line so there is black and white and red and red and yellow and green and blue and whatever kerry\ncassidy (kc how about your dna are you one of those as far as i know i am we probably all are in this room we probably all are in this room matter of fact i have found\nthat as the last ten or twelve years have progressed i have\nnoticed that many people when i talk to them about things that i\nknow that are a fact in both science mathematics and in history as\nwell as in my belief system i talk to certain people and the 85\npercent that i do not seem to have a medical problem with i.e the ones that have \u201cnormal human dna do not seem to understand what you are talking about when i talk to them it used to be that they would call me crazy or\nit used to be that they had be really interested and want to\nlearn about it but nowadays when you talk to those people when\nyou are done talking they do not say that is\ncrazy you are crazy i do not believe it they\ncome back into consciousness and start talking like you had never\nsaid a word absolutely yeah interesting so the people watching this video are probably\namong the 15 percent they are self-selective in many areas this is what we find well from what you have told me about the people that you deal\nwith i would believe that they are probably in that 15\npercent okay now there is so many places we can go from this\nconversation but there is something important which i want to\ngrab here and now and that is you made an allusion a few minutes\nago to when you moved here nine years ago to be in a very quiet secluded place with your laboratory which you are building to do your\nwork what can you say about why you are here and why people who are\nelsewhere might one day wish that they were also here well that is something that in our talks over the last day or so we have not really gotten into but i am in an area that had two\nrequirements for me and for some of the people who i do various\nthings for that are not to be named one\nof them is this area is very secluded from man-made electromagnetic\nradiation it is a deep valley with high mountains surrounding it in\n360 degrees the entrance to it is through a very narrow long winding canyon so we do not really get radio here or television directly the power that comes in here does have interference on it\nas well as it has information on it but it is very very secluded informationally then\nthe place that i chose here is kind of back in a little notch in the\nmountains so it is even more secluded that was one reason the\nother reason is it is an area that is very highly\ndefendable that was very important because of my belief and the\nbelief of many other people that i have great respect for that the\nworld is going through a i will call it a meltdown we are\ngoing through a change the alternative-thought radio and television\nshows and motion pictures and books and movies are all fraught with\nthe fact that something major is going to happen in 2010 or 2012 \u2013\nthe end of the mayan calendar earth changes a number of things the\nyellowstone caldera is very very active there are areas up there\nwhere the ground has risen my understanding is it is risen\nabout four feet we all know that there is got to be major\nvolcanic activity under yellowstone area because we can go up there\nand see the mud pots bubbling and old faithful geysering and smell\nthe sulfur coming out of hades and metaphorically the same thing may be happening politically exactly the same thing happening politically best i can tell we have been printing not only billions but trillions of\ndollars with nothing to back them whatsoever right now i have very\ndear friends in china that are offering me mature t-bills and mature\nus bonds that they cannot seem to get cashed that they are\noffering for 10 cents on the dollar and\nthere are trillions of dollars worth it would be enough that if the\nworld court system would enforce their eventual payment every man woman and child in the united states would have to work for four or\nfive generations to pay them off what is the connection between that\nand your being here well that and my being here is i am in an area that because\nif it is geographical location has four seasons but it has a\ngood growing season the area where i am exports both agricultural\nand meat product in far greater amounts than the people here would\nconsume one\npry bar or one stick of dynamite would shut access \u2013 not\negress particularly \u2013 but it certainly would shut access off so\nthat if there were indeed a failure of the currency and ensuing\npolitical and certainly geopolitical meltdown this area would be\nvery protected from large groups of people with no money and\ntherefore no food and no energy and whatever people who\u2019d come\nlooking for food would probably come to an area like this is there anything you can say about your belief of the likelihood of\nthese events transpiring i have been lead to believe in numerous briefings and people\nthat i know in fields that very definitely would know and so forth they have all warned me that i should be at a place like this many people even those from europe and other places that had very\nheavy financial connections in major cities around the world have\nclosed those offices down and a great number of them have expressed\na desire to move here if they have not already moved here and you mean here\nto this particular area here to this particular area uh-huh so you believe that there is something very important\nhappening this year and this one of the reasons why you are\ntalking to us that is one of the reasons why i am talking i have\nkind of if you would come out of the closet because i think that\nthe people that i find have the people now that are say 27 years\nold and younger have gone through a school system that has not\nschooled them has not trained them \u2013 obviously \u2013\nbecause if you know anything about education has very specifically\nnot trained them and not schooled them in political science certainly and in politics and in economics and certainly\ngeo-economics they just seem they do not have an idea of\nwhat is gone on you\nknow we look at a president that complained entirely about all the\nmoney that the previous president spent then in the first 90 days\nspent ten times as much now it was turned over to the fed to spend\nit and the fed in congressional testimony on television said we\ndo not have any idea where that money went we have no idea we\ncan tell you where two billion of it went but we certainly cannot\ntell you where seven trillion of it went or six trillion of it went we do not have any idea and you know the people have just let that pass by oh that means that ourselves and the next four generations of progeny\nare going to have to work their whole lives to pay this debt off and\nyet we do not even have any idea where it went or who has it it is certainly not out there helping the economy mm-hm now if this occurs would this be a worldwide problem i\nmean like the collapse of the dollar well it is\na worldwide problem i mean look back at james burke's programs on\nconnections the thing of it is \u2013 this is my opinion \u2013 but the unions\nhad to do something to get the union members to pay their dues and\nthe only thing they really could do was increase their salaries so\nthe unions have increased their salaries to a point where the work\nhas had to move off-shore because we do not have people that\nare willing to work and be blue-collar workers anymore they want to\nwork and get white-collar wages the\nwhite-collar people want to get white-collar wages rather than wages\nthat were consistent with their production so in essence they have\nstolen from the blue-collar workers and stolen from the rest of the\nworld by loaning them money and then taking all their natural\nresources at very low rates this\nhas happened all over the world it has not just happened here we are seeing economies beginning to fail everywhere we have\nbeen dealing with a system now for oh 70 years or better of fiat\nmoney \u2013 money that is backed with nothing it is like\nwas said about the irish when they moved into new york and into\nboston everybody\nmade money by taking in the neighbor\u2019s wash sure in your personal opinion and if you can qualify that personal\nopinion it would be useful  what do you think may happen if\nthere is some tipping-point of social instability or financial\ninstability that occurs before the end of this year what can people\nexpect well let us take a look at the depression in the late \u201820s people had ethics they had morality ethics and morality were\nremoved from the school systems 25 years ago and for specific\nreasons it had nothing to do with reasons of ethics or morality it\nhad to do with political reasons so they were taken from the school\nsystems so\nin the \u201820s when we had a depression people would go out to\nfarmland and knock on the farmer\u2019s door and say madam i got three little kids that need to eat and i will shovel\nmanure i will dig potatoes i will haul the weeds out of the\ngarden i will do whatever i need to do to get something to feed\nmy kids now\nwhat people have been taught is that they are owed\na living they are owed\nto live like television says that people should live they do not\nhave an ethic they do not have a morality so\nwhat happens is if we have a financial collapse it will not be\nlike the \u201820s it is going to be like today and you are\ngoing to have anarchy and absolute chaos the government knows that they have recently asked the service members if they would fire\non civilians if they were asked to \u2013 which is entirely\nagainst\nthe constitution we\nhad a second amendment and the founders of our country in writing\nafter the constitution about where the second amendment came from did not say that we should have the right to keep and bear arms\nso that we could go get a deer and feed the family they specifically\nstated we had the right to keep and bear arms so that if the\ngovernment with its military got out of hand and tried to suppress\nthe constitution and civilians they could take control back because\nthe government was supposed to lie in the hands of the people now not that i believe that the people are smart enough to handle\nthemselves because they are not otherwise we would not\nhave had the last several presidents that we have had we had\nhave actually had senators and congressmen thrown out because they\nwould not do for us what was necessary and the senators and\ncongressmen had no option because we had so many splinter groups that\nthey had to keep satisfied that they could not do what was\nnecessary for the people as they were charged to do is there anything you can say on record about a recent congressional\nsession that you attended yes uh probably better not said okay just note that there was the third my understanding it was the\nthird-ever closed session of congress okay i understand but it is on google so yeah i think many things have leaked out about it on google we\nfound that no matter where the politician was and what committee he\nwas on when top secret things were talked about they wanted to\nclose the session early so they could get out and put their tips out\nto the news we do not have any confidentiality in that it\nleaked out i am sure am i right in assuming that you would not contradict those\nleaks i would not contradict them at all thank you but were not they told to were not some of them getting out\nof the country to relocate in south america ask him that that is my understanding george green has given us testimony to that effect yeah that is my understanding that a number of them felt that once the people found out what had been done to them by their\nrepresentatives they felt that it would be much better for their\nhealth and safety to be somewhere else mm-hm and that kind of says it all do you know anything or\nsuspect anything about once the financial system fails if it does\nso what would it be replaced by well up until a few days ago i would say it would have been\nreplaced by a world currency remember the last four presidents have\nall been members of the council on foreign relations and have openly\nstated that they are moving toward a one world government and\nbelieve we should have a one world government if we had a one world\ngovernment we had probably have a one world currency and\nit might even be they were smart enough to have a currency that was\nbacked by something real like gold or silver or various metals i have\nalways wanted to see a commodity-backed currency so you could have a\ncurrency that was worth so much corn or so much wheat or so much of\nsomething that was a real tangible thing sure up until a few days ago you said what changed up until a few days ago what changed was my understanding is now\nthat they are well the nafta and gatt agreements basically\nput us into a system where we had mexico united states and canada\nalmost as one government with three parts there\nwas going to be a you know it is been highly rumored that\nthere was a printed currency available \u2013 pictures available on\nthe internet etcetera etcetera because there is nothing\nthat is a secret anymore \u2013 that would have currency different colors and different sizes for different denominations and\nwas to be called something like the amero\nfor\nnorth america it is\nbeen rumored that that currency is being destroyed now and replaced\nby another u.s currency that is being printed and that would make a\nlot of sense because there is so much well the money that is\nbeing printed is funny\nmoney because\nit is backed on nothing but also there is been so much\ncounterfeiting especially out of iran so you can look at some of\nour politics with iran having to do with nuclear proliferation and\nso much of it having to do with the fact that they have good printing\npresses and good duplicators of paper and ink there is been a\ntremendous amount of currency that we know has moved here from iran\nthat is counterfeit and it is rampant yeah many people watching this video will be aware of what david\nicke has been talking about we spoke to him at length earlier on\nthis year and one of the drums that he is been beating is about what\nhe feels is the danger of the population being chipped\nas a means of control which is going to be linked with their ability\nto operate financially at all can you comment on that at all there are a number of things to lead one to believe that they are\ngoing to be shipping people around there are a number of places that\nthere is no explanation for but very large concentration camps have\nsprung up one of them very near where i live here that is very\nlarge-sized on\nthe other hand i was involved back in the '70s with a very large\nfood and feed company to build chips that could be used on prize\ncattle and breeding cattle for example and show cattle to\ngeolocate them or to identify them that\ntechnology has now been reduced down to things that can be injected\nthrough a hypodermic needle into the body and identify people the\ncurrency that i heard about that was to be a one world currency was\nbased on being chipped the credits if you would would go onto and off of that chip by a method similar\nto bluetooth that is used today and this is technology which you yourself have helped develop is\nthat what i heard you say well it is technology that i developed some of the early things and it is technology which in it is smaller implementation i am using\nright now in a product that i am in the process of building for\ngeolocation and anti-theft because there is so many people being\nkidnapped and sacrificed for their organs or being kidnapped and\nheld for ransom \u2013 not the least of which is around the\nmogadishu area and in the mediterranean but also even in mexico a\ntremendous number of people are being kidnapped for ransom there both their own people and visitors there is a problem tracking containers there is a problem tracking sea-land containers as well why is it important to track these containers well there are around 10,000 containers a day coming into the\ncountry that are never physically inspected we know that weapons of\nmass destruction though this is not totally announced but we know\nweapons of mass destruction are coming in in those containers we\nknow terrorists are coming in in those containers because we see the\nevidence of it afterward thank\ngod the government has picked up a lot of these things later but the containers \u2013 a lot of them are shipping contraband a\nlot of them are shipping you know we saw the dog food come in\nthat was laced with melamine because it was not inspected now we just did a tape change here and just before that little\ninterlude david was very keen to ask pete about his view about how\ncan we transform these danger signs into something that is a healthy\nwarning to us what sorts of proactive positive-thinking responsible actions can we take without just blindfolding ourselves\nand ignoring whatever real risks that might be there now\nthis is my bridge because i want david to ask his own questions this\nis one of the reasons why he is here with us we have a huge respect\nfor david his intellect his perspective his experience david this is all yours you want to talk to pete about this very important\nthing here sure what i wanted to say was just that i have a perspective which\nincludes documenting my dreams every day for the last 17 years following their guidance getting accurate information from that\nguidance yesterday morning while we were talking about all these\nthings i had a dream in which there was a volcanic eruption it\nlooked terrifying there were rocks flying into the air and everybody\naround me thought we were all going to die we ran under these trees the rocks fell all around us but we were all fine nobody was\nactually hurt by it obviously it was a disaster obviously it had\ncaused property damage but the people were okay that is\none of many different varieties of data that i have gotten to suggest\nthat even though things look like they could be really austere and\napocalyptic that humanity will persevere through this and that we\nwill be able to have a positive outcome on our own futures and that\nthis is not a situation that is completely outside of our ability to\nmanage well david you had a question that you asked me just before the\nbreak and i think we are going to agree to disagree but go ahead and\nask that question again or make that statement again it was a very good question it was about prior warnings not having\ncome to pass and therefore why should we be concerned oh okay yeah let me give you some prelude to that i spoke with\nanother witness who was involved in various compartmentalized\nprojects one in particular which was at the montauk base and he had\nextensive contact with people on the inside one\nof the things that he said was that the superdomes that were built in\nall the major cities were intended to be large holding containers for\npeople to be herded in he said that there was a plan that the rodney\nking riots would foment enough social upheaval that they would be\nable to actually round up black people who were rioting in the cities\nand put them inside these domes and basically keep them in there\nuntil they passed away that\nwas a plan that was made and it obviously did not happen so we have\nheard from many project camelot witnesses similar plans timelines in which the powers that be whoever they are say\napocalyptic things are going to happen the dates come strange\nthings happen yes but it does not lead to an apocalypse scenario so in private conversation with us you had mentioned that there were\nother dates that came and went where they had said something like\nthis might happen some friends of yours inside told you something\nlike that and then it did not actually turn into a social breakdown yes okay i did say that and so the question is well the question is in terms of you had mentioned before that\npeople have a conditioning to not think and a conditioning of mind\ncontrol you said that there is a degradation in the moral fabric of\nour society so i think what we really need to know on a personal\nlevel is what can we do to help ourselves not be indoctrinated by\nthis passive programming that is coming out to us you mentioned\nversions of mind control and things like that i think that is an\nimportant key to not getting stuck in this trap i moved here because i was told by various people that i should\ngeolocate and be in an area that would be safe when we eventually got\na financial and therefore a political collapse so there're\ncertain things that i have done to make sure that myself and my family\nand my friends are safe from that the\nquestion that david just asked is a little bit different having to\ndo with the fact that numerous ones of us have heard a bit\napocalyptic things in the future ranging from the fact that supposedly in the year 2011 or 2012 we have the end of the mayan\ncalendar and we have an apocalypse coming people who are apocalyptic\nchristians say about the same thing that the end times are here or\ncoming we have heard very dire things about the economic posture of\nthe united states and the whole world and we see things happening we\nsee iceland for example declaring bankruptcy and i hear from\npeople that i know in the banking system that a number of the\neuropean states are going to follow them in bankruptcy when the u.s currency fails which i cannot imagine that it will not because we have\nprinted so much currency and put out there that is backed by nothing\n it is all beginning to come home and roost the t-bills and bonds\nare coming back to us and i cannot see what is going to happen there we\nhave the huge collapse that when before the current president took\noffice 16 billion dollars was going to solve all the problems and\nplease\nget this bill through and we\ncan take 16 billion dollars and put it out in and\nit barely passed and we got that through then\nit seemed like three weeks later we did not know where the 16 billion\ndollars was even supposed to go or what for because they passed the\nbill without even knowing what was going to happen that 16 billion\ndollars disappeared immediately and now all of a sudden we needed\nseven or nine trillion dollars and then we needed 20 you know and\nwe do not have any idea where that\nwent so\nthe things we have heard in the past about there going to be a failure the time came and left and there was not a failure but this money was\npumped somewhere and of course the system had a lot more inertia\nthan we anticipated so now what we have is something that the\nactuality is coming to roost i drive around in the town that i live\nnearby the large town that is about 50 miles south of me and i drive\naround there and i look in the little malls and i look in the big\nmalls the big mall has closed we only had one mall in the town and\nthe gross population  nearly well 750,000 people the\none mall that we had the people that had the mall failed and went\nbankrupt and it is closed all the stores that sell non-essential\nitems \u2013 jewelry stores bed and bath stores etcetera \u2013\nmost of them have closed sporting goods stores most of them have\nclosed what you are saying is that we have not been here before this is\nsomething new so we have not really ever been here before you know we have heard\nthat things are going to happen things are going to fail but life\ncontinued on as normal and the government continued to print money\nand pass it out to its friends and so forth so therefore we are in\na bit different set of circumstances i moved here in 1999 because i\nwas told  by 2001 that the system was going to fail and here\nwe are eight years later or nine years later in fact you were ordered\nto come here i was so we found out that no it did not fail i had go for a\nbriefing and they had just be in shock we\ndo not understand it we do not have any idea why it has not failed i\nmean we just do not know the only thing we can do is say there was\nso much inertia so now it is beginning to fail and it is not just beginning to fail \nit is increasing on a logarithmic scale and very shortly i see that\nit just about has to do that which then brings us back to the first\nquestion that david asked just before the break was what\ndo i see that we could offer the listeners out there something that\nthey might do and i can say well in my personal opinion and\nwhat i have done i have put my money and my talent my skills and my\nabilities where my mouth is i have come here and i am self-sufficient i grow all my own meat all my own vegetables i have stored up those\nthings that are going to be critical to society i have picked up the\ntools that i did not have that allow me to do things in such an\nenvironment and such a society to produce things that are going to be\nnecessary for people to have and you can even make your own radio and probably fuel your own\ntruck exactly right i have a number of vehicles that i now have \nengines that'll burn alcohol i have the equipment and i have the\nseeds and i have the tractor and i have the land and i have the\nwater to grow material that i can make alcohol from at a much larger\nrate than i need now a lot of people listening to this will say but\ni am in the middle of a big city i have got a wife and a mortgage and\ntwo kids who are at school and i hear what you are saying but what\ncan i do i am not in that situation what\nwould you tell them well i have taught survival for better than 40 years and my\nparticular area of expertise in survival was urban survival i was\nasked to write a book about urban survival and i started the book\nout and i can tell you that \u2013 we got into that a little bit\nearlier \u2013 i can tell you that today there is not any such thing\nas urban survival who knows their neighbors in '29 people knew\ntheir neighbors and they had ethics and morality now the ethics and\nmorality has been taken away from the children and the children are\nnow in their 20s and 30s the community's gone the community is gone we do not have a community that would do that and we have people that have children and now some of them have a\ncouple children what are you going to do when your kids say daddy my tummy hurts i have not had anything to eat for two weeks and you smell the next door neighbor over there who was a wise\nsquirrel and put something up and you smell him out on his barbeque\n- because he is got no power but charcoal - cooking a couple of\nfreeze-dried steaks you have to ask yourself what\nwould that person do okay but there are a lot of psychological operations that have been\nput in place in preparation for all of this and there is mental\nself-defense or mental preparation emotional preparation spiritual\npreparation is there something that you can speak to about that whatever people's circumstances are well i will do that but first i want to suggest that take a\nlook at just the things that have happened forget the\npolitical-economic situation let us take a look at things that have\nhappened in this country over the last say four or five years you have\ngot the debacle that occurred in new orleans and then you have got the\nnext debacle that occurred in texas and mississippi and you got to\nsee that no all those people could not leave town because they got\nout on the freeway and the freeway was jammed everybody got stopped\nand they ran out of gas and there was not any gas the people that\nowned the service stations left to get out of town also so there\nwas not anything for the service stations you\nlook at new orleans i knew people that were getting water to new\norleans that had been ordered it was a year until it got delivered there were people who got thousands and thousands of trailer-houses\nthat were stuck in the midwest and never got shipped down there nobody got to use them but by the time they got where they could have\nput them down there the things had already decayed and they found\nout they were made with the wrong materials and they were out-gassing\ntoxic things that\nwas how well the government was prepared for that they saw it coming\nand saw it coming and saw it coming \u2013 nothing happened then\nyou look at the people that live along the mississippi river and its\nfeeding tributaries they have had floods virtually every year every\nyear they have floods and they go back and they rebuild their houses\nwith lots of insurance money and then they have floods the next\nyear the\nweather is changing i think it is changing to the colder rather than\nthe warmer but anyway the weather is changing very definitely it is changing right here where i live tremendously so in the last\ncouple of winters we have had two-to-three times the snow that we had\nthe previous ten years then we have had water from it major major\nwater problems we had droughts for a number of years i live near a\nhuge huge reservoir that holds enough water to irrigate the whole\nsouthern state for a year or two and it is been absolutely dry in the\nbottom hardly a trickle and now it is clear full and spilling over so in summary you are saying that as a scientist and as an\nintelligent man as somebody who is well-connected on the inside with\nother scientists and other intelligent men you think that there is a\nreal problem i think that there is a major real problem and i think that people\nwho do not see that and do not realize that simply have put blinders\non i think that what they should do is think you\nknow maybe there is something to this but\nat least we see that in major areas of the country there've been\nproblems where people needed to have a little supply of food left\nbecause they could not get to a store they\nneed to have things that if they have to leave their homes like\nin the area that i am in and in california especially and in other\nstates especially there've been major major fires that have gone\non people have been moved out of their homes and when they left\nhome and they came back and they are crying on television oh everything's gone everything's gone and\nyet some of those people went to survival lectures that i gave and\nthey had copies of their driver's license copies of their marriage\nlicense copies of their insurance papers copies of all the things\nthey needed to have copies of they had extras of all the children's\npictures and extras of the journals and so forth put away in another\nlocation these are things that people can do to assure continuity\neven though there may be something coming california we hear predictions about earthquakes all the time and we see\nearthquakes all the time some are small and some are larger but we\nhear the people that actually are predicting those things predicting\nvery large earthquakes they do not know if it is going to be next year\nor the year after but they know it is going to come they know it is\ngoing to be large they know people are going to lose things why\ndo not these people have what is called a bug-out\nbag in\ntheir car where they could take off and leave the area the\ngovernment says oh you only need to have three days storage but\nwe look at where the government's come in time after time after time\nover just the last four or five years and found out the government\ndid not have anything for them they had to fend for themselves it\nwas months sometimes before they had effort come in it is\nvery interesting to understand when i teach a survival class one\nof the things i do is right at the beginning of the class i put a\nvelvet bag over people's head then i tell them i am\ngoing to place a ten dollar gold piece somewhere in the room and have\nyou all look for it whoever finds it gets to keep it so\ni do that and then i say okay go look for it and\nimmediately someone says oh here it is i have it i found it and everybody takes their bag off and says well\nthat is no fair he did not have a hood on and\ni say okay so let us say that there is a big earthquake or a big emergency and if\nyou do not have a way of communicating\n\u2013 because\nthe cell phones are going to be down the radio stations are going to\nbe down \u2013\nif you\ndo not have a way of communicating outside of those it is like having\na bag over your head you are\nnot going to know what roads are blocked you are not going to know\nwhat roads have police that are not allowing people to go through you are not going to have gasoline in your car if\nyou had a short-wave radio or an amateur radio which are very\ninexpensive you could listen to the radio amateurs who are going to\nbe immediately there because that is what they are set up for that is\nwhat they are trained to do if you had an amateur radio license which anybody can get these days it is like you had eyes you can see\nwhere to go where there is problems where there are not problems where there are riots where there are not riots and carry on and go\nthere if\nyou had a bug-out bag in your car you had have gas and fuel and medical\nsupplies things to keep you warm things to keep you cool all\npacked up ready to go just a small bag so there are a number of\nthings that one could do to become aware there is a lot that has been done to dumb down the population how can this be reversed how can that be aided i want to make sure\nthat david gets a chance to answer his own questions what i am trying\nto do is support you in that and i want to give you air time here there is a compartment of reality that we can talk about in which\npeople are on this planet and there are forces that appear to be\nalmost outside their control to do anything about other than as you\nsaid preparations for the sake of survival then we also have\nanother context which is that you are apparently directly aware of\nextraterrestrials who are not strictly negative in fact you\nmentioned to us before that a lot of them are positive we know\nthey are out there we know they are visiting us while\ni do not believe they are going to just come down and save us from\nproblems there appears to be a greater reality that we are all\ninvolved in and that this situation my understanding is that the\nsituations we are going through are going to be instrumental in\nhelping to purge the negative influences on this planet that have\nbeen prevailing for so long not make them worse there will be certainly a crisis time that we go through but that is part of a\npassage into a more organized and enlightened society that is how\nit is been explained by many different accurate sources in my\nopinion including ancient prophecies that speak of the coming of a\ngolden age well one of the things that i did in studying survival was i went\nto numerous places on the face of the earth where there were\nsurvival-type things taking place whether it be genocide in africa whether it be eruption of volcanoes whether it be tornadoes and\ntsunamis i have gone to those places studying survival and i know one\nthing there is one person i can rely on and that is me and all the\nrest is conjecture i\nfound out that the people that survived were the people that were\nprepared some were prepared mentally and that is the major\npreparation that you could do but i know that when you believe in\nother people that may or may not happen but if you believe in\nyourself and follow up it does happen and you do not have any worry i\nfound out that a few days or a few hours or even a few minutes can\nbe the difference between life and death so i would just as soon\nspend a little time and a little effort and a little money and be\nable to take care of myself and my people and if other things\nhappen so much the better i have things i can share with others yeah i do not dispute that at all in fact i am very well prepared\nfor eventualities in myself we also at project camelot have\ninterviewed enough different witnesses that we are trying to look at\nthe big picture perspective i\ndo believe that we have an intelligently-guided planet i do believe\nthat the things that happen on the planet are not random and i do\nbelieve that society itself is going through an evolutionary process a lot of the things that you have shared with us already off the\nrecord reveal that there are potentials of the human being much\ngreater than what we currently understand you have\nalso suggested there are efforts to suppress our natural ability that\nhave been put in place and i think that while absolutely preparing\nis important i think anything you can tell us about how people can\nstrengthen their intuitive faculty so that they have an ability to\nget in touch with that part of themselves that does have the\nknowledge \u2013 you have mentioned remote viewing before too if\nthey have some way something you can share with us a way in which\npeople can greater empower themselves to the greater awareness that\nthey actually possess and how that could help them through these\ntransitional times maybe that would be important to hear well actually strangely enough we really agree and i think we are\nboth saying that one should do both because then you do not have to\nrely on anything you do not have to rely on somebody else that is the problem what is been taken out of people over the last 20 years is\nresponse-ability people have to take responsibility over\nthe millennia the people that we have considered major major\nprophets such as the prophets of mohammedanism the prophets of\nchristianity prophets of record such as nostradamus and so forth every one of those and all the religions have said take\nresponsibility and prepare yourself the\nthings that david\u2019s talking about to prepare are exactly\ncorrect people should have those skills they should go out and\npractice those and i know that your group has been superb in\nproviding evidence and providing a website that is a fantastic website\nwhere they can go and look and find out people that are talking about\nsuch things people that are saying such things i am\nbasically a warrior because that is kind of my path and i have noticed\nthat there is not anybody out there in this world that is taking care\nof me except me that is not necessarily true because the knowledge the intellect the experience the vast experience that i have has\nbeen handed to me on a silver platter it is like i stuck my hand in\nthe air to volunteer and got a hiccup in my rotator cuff and my hand\njust stayed up and i ended up volunteering for everything kerry\nlaughs]\n\neverybody\nthought i was volunteering and so i got stuck into a number of\ndifferent things but none of it as i look back on it was by\naccident i\nknow that there are a number of people that were students of mine\nthat were in new orleans that were in the gulf area of texas that\nwere in the river areas in ohio and nebraska and so forth and\ntennessee i know that all of them when the time came just simply\nthrew a bag in the back of their car and headed out and they were\nfine all their family records were preserved and all their family\njewels and things everybody knew where they were they were all in\none place threw them in the car and off they went the car was full\nof gas with a little trailer with a couple of gas cans and a tent and they were fine i am\njust suggesting that that is a very wise thing to do on a day like\ntoday whether the prophets of doom are correct or whether they are\nnot correct let us say you put aside five months worth of food well go take a look at the prices in the store and the prices five months\nago and tell me you would not like to buy five-months-ago\u2019s\nfood or today's food at five-months-ago\u2019s prices you know it is better than any investment you could have made it is better than\nany stock i know of it is even better than gold if a disaster comes it is going to be worth far more than gold because it will save your\nlife where gold will just get you robbed \u2013 or silver i\ntell people if you are going to save gold for crying out loud save\nsome silver because if we have a collapse when it comes you know get yourself a wheelbarrow and if you come to my place and want a\nloaf of bread and you have got an ounce of gold that is worth at that\ntime 2,000 i will swap it for a loaf of bread if you have\ngot a quarter that by that time is worth three dollars \u2013 a\nnon-numismatic silver quarter \u2013 i will swap it for a loaf of\nbread take your pick right so there are things that people can do to do that and there are\nthings that they can do there are a number of remote viewing courses\nand many of them are very good i had suggest you do remote\nviewing but\ni said besides remote viewing i know one thing that is certain i can\ntake my little ham radio and i can pick it up and i can call on the\nham radio repeater and i say what is\nthe traffic like on route 17 going out through palmdale and\nsomebody's going to say oh all the cars are stopped and they are not letting people through or\nthey are going to say oh the traffic's flowing just fine and\ni know that is the direction to get out of town sure a lot of people would want us to ask this question it is\nalmost a matter of duty and that is how much does obama know about\nall of this in your opinion uh that is a strange question i cannot imagine anyone\naccepting the job of president with the current situation i cannot\nimagine that so in that respect i have to say he cannot be very\nintelligent on the other hand he is an intelligent man he certainly\nis an intelligent speaker of course he was a debate king if you\nwould i\nknow that when he got his first briefing because i had friends that\nwere present said that he was so shocked that he had to sit down\nwhen he found out what really was happening this was before he took\nthe office now i think that he is found himself in a river that is\nflooded and headed south and he is got a little boat with no oars and very steep canyon walls and steep canyon walls and he is just paddling with his hands as\nfast as he can paddle and trying to do the very best job that he can he has a few really good people around him i really do not believe he\nhas a hint how to stop what is happening i do not think he has a hint\nhow to stop the flood because it is behind him and it is coming on and he is being driven by it and there is not much he can do now speaking about having good people with him just using that\nturn of phrase would you confirm that there are\ngood people who we have euphemistically called the white hats in\nthe government and the intelligence and the military who themselves\nare patriots as you are and they are trying to do their best from the\ninside to avert these things absolutely there are many people that left the military most of\nthe good people left during clinton and bush because they could not\npledge allegiance to the president because of the things that were\nbeing done so many people left on the other hand there were many\npeople that stayed behind because they knew they were going to be\nneeded they sacrificed not principle but they had a higher\nknowledge and stayed behind so that they could ply the knowledge that\nthey had when the time came that is where they thought they would be most valuable that is where they thought they would be most valuable and they were\nthe true patriots because they did what was best for the people\nrather than what was best for themselves and these are the people who are keeping you informed sometimes is\nthat right some of those people are the people that are keeping me informed i understand i mean it is more that they are keeping me informed because they call\nme for ideas i am kind of an idea man and they call me and ask me what\nmight we do here and what might we do there because you are above all a problem solver and a technological i am basically a problem solver mm-hm do you think there is ever going to be a disclosure that any of this\nstuff about ufos or other races not born on earth would ever get out\nto the public it is interesting i have been told that a number of the apocalypse\nfilms that have come out recently and a number of the science\nfiction things that have come out recently as movies have been\npartially funded by the government wanting to get familiar in our\nminds the idea there might be people that could come and help us there might be some kind of divine providence that would help as\nwell i have heard kind of through the grapevine that i\nknow that reagan was asked to disclose such things the truth about\nflying saucers and alien people i know that jfk was asked those\nthings and said he would do something and i know there was pressure\nput to bear on both of them to say nothing i know that the current\npresident i do not know this i have\nheard\nthat the current president was planning to make such announcements\nlater in the year or late in the year are you willing to say the date and that information that you i know a date i was told and i can tell you the same people that\ntold me that date told me that the u.s currency would fail in 2001\nwhen they ordered me to move here okay so who knows what is going to happen but i have heard that his\ndesire and i may be wrong i do not know i have heard it through the\ngrapevine the man has not told me himself but he is under orders is not he he is just the front guy my feeling is that we have not had a president since right after\ngeorge washington that was not under orders from someone else if you\ngo back and take a look at it it is pretty obvious then if the guy does not obey those orders he may find himself in\ntrouble he may find himself in trouble do you want to talk about who is behind him at all i really do not okay about the announcement though you were working up to an\nannouncement you were saying that he may announce something at the\nend of the year what would that be what does your grapevine tell\nyou my grapevine tells me that he is going to announce that there are\nindeed such things as flying saucers and there is indeed technology\ntransfer and there is indeed beings behind it that did not come from\nthis planet how many different kinds i you know we are getting into speculation here that understand you know whether the person that told me would know i have no\nidea whether the president would know i have no idea whether we\neven know i have no idea but a number of them more than say three or four good again if you go back and look at the number of people who seem to\nhave seen such people you get kind of a well there is a reptilian type and there is a long-face type and a\nround-face type and a tall type and a short type and it\nis not just like one person said this and one person said that it is\n50 people in the u.s and 20 people in germany and 300 people in\nbrazil and 80 people in africa say this then for the next bunch\nthere is maybe 40 or 50 in russia and 25 or 30 in germany you know you cannot discount all of those things when from totally disparate\nregions that have no real communication and people have no real\ncommunication with each other you have people doing exact\ndescriptions and large amounts of exact descriptions yeah and tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands reporting\ncontact with the little guys with the almond-shaped eyes and the big\nheads who many people say are responsible for abductions do you\nknow anything about that at all all i know is that i have talked to a number of those people and many\nof them seem to me to be very credible many of them seem to me to\nhave read somebody else's report and then they wanted to be in the\nthing and made it up are any of these abductions military operations i would not have any idea you do not know okay ed\nnote video splice begins here look i cannot see why the dollar did not crash in 2001 absolutely\ncould not see why it did not crash because it was backed with nothing it was inertia in my opinion it was inertia only\nthat\ncarried it on and sure there were a lot of people behind the scenes\nmanipulating various things you saw how they manipulated billions\nand billions of dollars that did not even not only were bogus\ndollars i.e dollars that were printed with nothing behind them dollars that did not even exist people\nfail to look at this fact if let us say \u2013 we will use just\nround figures \u2013 let us say that there is $1,000 issued okay who issues the dollars the fed issues the dollars \u2013\ntotally outside of the constitution as far as i am concerned the\nfed issues $1,000 they then rent those dollars to the bank what\ndoes the bank do the bank rents those dollars out to people so they\ncan by a car a home whatever they say we will\nrent this out to you and it will be at five percent interest now what that means is they have taken a thousand \u2013 and if they have\n$1,000 the banks are allowed to loan out $17,000 so let us say you\nhave ten percent interest on $17,000 now that is $10,000 plus another\n$7,000 where does the $7,000 come from to pay it back it was not\never issued it did not ever exist how can they pay back more than\nthere ever\nwas and people do not understand the concept of fiat money right there are many videos on google that people can watch on this\nvery subject and get educated yeah absolutely and the problem is that people have been taught\nthat if you just stick your head in the sand and do not look it is not\ngoing to bite you keep on watching american\nidol\nand you will be all right keep on watching american\nidol and keep on going to the movies and keep on you know whatever i had like to say one thing there is footage that you can see of an\nannouncement that rumsfeld made on september 10th 2001 about money\nthat was \u201clost in the military budget to the tune of 2.3\ntrillion dollars \u2013 the day before september 11 so is that in\nanyway related to what you are talking about with the year 2001 probably is and there are a number of other things let us\nlook at what happened on september 11th a building that\nwas not even involved crashed to the ground and in the basement\nof it was stored a massive amount of gold it was never found okay never found and why would that building fall down not even ashes fell on it it was out of the wind pattern right where did that money go and why did that building fall down well do you know the answer well i think i know the answer but i do not know that i am\nconvenient with giving that answer because you know i do not\nwant to prompt somebody to go look for it because i know what i feel\nthey had find i think what they had probably find is an\nearly grave by now people watching this video will understand why we were so\nkeen to introduce pete to this audience and will understand what we\nwere saying when we referred to twelve hours of off-record\nconversation yesterday that we have not even begun to bottom\nout even so what\nwe are able to provide here is only a very short summary of some\nof the things which pete knows so with apologies we are going\nto move on because we have only got a certain amount of time and\na certain amount of tape to other areas because there is an\nextraordinary amount of experience and information which you may want\nto share let\nme first of all ask you if you are willing to share any of\nyour experience about working with russian scientists and in what\ncapacity you did that yes i had be more than happy to do that some of it at least after the fall of the wall i went to russia and worked\nwith a number of top scientists there that were involved in their\nspace program and you went to russia let me say euphemistically in a\nprofessional capacity in a professional capacity i came by invitation and went there one\nof the things we did was we took \u2013 and i am going to use\nrussia\nin general terms meaning the old soviet union the u.s.s.r i went to various countries that were at one time part of the\nu.s.s.r i\nwas there for example when ukraine declared their independence and\ni knew the man who was the first president there so we took out of\nthe u.s.s.r a lot of technology that had been pent up and brought\nback and donated it to the government here i\ngot to see brilliant brilliant brilliant technology that \u2013\nsome we knew about some we had and some we did not have specifically in materials science and in things that could be used to\ngenerate alternative energy new\nways of building motors new types of materials for building motors\nand spacecraft motors and\nspacecraft new ways of storing electricity in capacitors which would be very\nhandy in making electric automobiles meaning that you could take all\nthe energy that normally is sent to the air as heat and braking and\nput that energy into a capacitor device which would then bleed off\ninto a battery and recharge the battery of the car to a certain\nextent did the technology behind the aurora come from the russians no that technology was invented specifically right here in the\nunited states by a scientist that i in my memory worked for general\ndynamics for a period of time and probably worked for rocketdyne or\ngeneral atomic for a period of time remember general atomic was\nhighly disturbed when lyndon johnson refused to give them any more\ngovernment contracts unless they had move from san diego to\ntexas mm-hm but the aurora\u2019s been moth-balled anyway because that is\nold technology is not it well i would assume that but it was a technology where you spray\ngas out through a surface and then explode the gas mix it with\noxygen and explode it it is like push-shooting a pumpkin seed the pressure external would push against it and push it forward at\nvery high rates of speed they are very efficient okay so that was our 60-second sound byte about the\naurora which is worth an interview in itself but go back to what\nyou feel that we learned from the russians because we had some\nfascinating conversations about this well we learned an awful lot about material science there was a\nman by the name of i m frenchovic \nthat\nwas a believer in quantum physics so he would not hire anybody\n\u2013 this was in the late \u201850s or mid-50s \u2013 he\nwould not hire anybody for his institute that did not\nabsolutely believe in quantum physics so a lot of the work they did\nwas based on quantum physics and we had not quite decided\nwhether that was real or not whether\nit was real or not they came up with a lot of things that were very\ninteresting additionally they were doing a lot of research work in\nsuch areas as remote viewing and telekinesis and such things we\nlearned a lot we brought a number of people out from there that\ntaught us things this\nwas a very interesting thing that happened in the soviet union if\nyou look at their government it is kind of a three-branch party\nsystem you have the people from industry the people from\ngovernment and the people from the political pedagogy so that to\nget the full vote you had to have someone vote that it was not\nin violation of stalinist-leninist political dogma a\nlot of science was definitely outside of stalinist-leninist political\ndogma therefore the scientists were very frustrated and so there was\na lot of information they were willing to give out because their\ngovernment had told them it was baloney anyway so why not give it\naway they wanted to see their ideas and thoughts utilized secondly there were a lot of them that one way or another snuck out and came\nto work for the west and brought a lot of very good information including a lot of the very basic things that were happening in what\nwe will call psychic\nphenomena\nor mental\ntalents it\nreally is not that it is actually a definite science and\nthere is a lot of technology that is behind it we hear a\nlot of stories about that from the government a lot of past history\nthat is much of it disinformation we are told that well we learned a few things from it but it was not particularly\ngood i\nthink that that is very wrong because i know it is\nparticularly very good and i cannot imagine that they are\nnot using that kind of technology additionally we learned a tremendous amount of things about outer space\ntechnology we learned a lot about the amount of radiation that you\nfind outside the ionosphere and the problems that that causes we had\nsome problems with our early astronauts because we did not know\nwhat was there notice\nthere were several lulls in our space program as we found out new\nthings and then geared up to take into account the malevolence of\nouter space you know out of that came a lot of conjecture that\nthere was way too much radiation for us to have had people in outer\nspace one\nof the things that very much interested me was when the mir space\nstation was crashing they were worried about the fact that it had a\nlittle radioactive material on it that might cause problems on earth\nand they did not know exactly where it was going to fall but\none of the things the soviets announced and one of the things i do\nis i listen to short wave because when you listen to short wave you\nhear about the same event the same people the same place the same\ntime and a completely different story of what went on there so the press in the united states is either completely\nignorant or it is completely controlled as far as i can tell but\none of the things the soviets did was announce the weight of the mir\nstation when you look at that weight you find out it was about\n5,600 shuttle loads of material they did not launch that much we did not launch that much so why would the mir weigh as much\nas it did the\nexplanation is which you can find out for yourself if you merely\ntake a sensitive geiger counter on a plane flight is how much\nradiation is up there just at 30,000 feet you are allowed one\nor two chest x-rays a year you get a chest x-ray every two or three\nminutes out there you know that was a problem if you look at some\nof the symptoms of problems some of the early astronauts had you had\nrealize that it probably was radiation poisoning how did the mass that constituted all that extra shielding my feeling is that the extra mass that was there on that station was\nshielding how did it get up there that is an interesting question i did not see us launch\nanything that could have taken it there did the russians launch it there not that i know of i mean you have seen the okay now what that implies then is that we could never have made\nit to the moon in the way that it had been advertised that we went to\nthe moon because everyone would have been fried is that too\nsimplistic a conclusion well that is my conclusion i mean i know one thing you can\ngo to look at the moon diorama at jet propulsion laboratory and you\ncan ask the question was\nthe lander pressurized with oxygen they said no we did not have a place for it they had to wear their\nspacesuits and\nhere\u2019s the astronaut standing there with his spacesuit on and\nhere\u2019s the door to the lander open and you can see that that\nspacesuit would not fit through that door without\nthe\nastronaut in it right so i did have a bit you know there is a bit of speculation\nthere what we have been told by our witness henry deacon is that some\nof the apollo missions did actually go to the moon but not without\nhelp from our friends as it were can you make any comment on that or is this well it is my feeling as a scientist that if we went to the\nmoon we had to have help from friends and off-world friends you are talking about i am talking about we are talking about friends\nin high places friends in high\nplaces from\nhigh places but we do have friends\nin high places do we far as i know do we have any enemies far as i know we do i mean there\u2019ve been malevolent things\nhappening all over the world that you know you cannot deny\ncattle mutilation and you cannot deny some personal or human mutilation or certainly biomedical manipulation i mean it is\nhappened somebody did it and it could have been done from here but\nwhen you examine that you\nknow linda moulten howe has written extensively and spoken\nextensively on these things and examined them extensively i grew up\nwith her in the same school system and the same town and know that\nshe was exceedingly bright and got brighter and brighter as time\nwent by i do not doubt that a lot of her conclusions are\ncorrect conclusions she is someone that i would absolutely\ntrust in that you\nknow i say if something happens in one spot you do not know but when something happens time after time year after year in all\ndifferent kinds of locations where people do not know each other\nand do not communicate with each other and do not read each\nother\u2019s newspapers and it does not make the press it\nseems highly likely that those things happened i understand now among many other things you are let me use the\nword an electronics genius if i may are you in possession of any information about the\nconstitution of implants that have been recovered from abductees well i have talked to people who have removed what they felt\nwere implants i deal almost daily with nanoelectronics and\nmicroelectronics and the descriptions and pictures i have seen\nhave nothing to do with any nano- and microelectronics that we have\nfrom anyone that i know of here on this planet many\nof them or most of them are biological in nature i know that one\ndoctor who is removed a number of what they felt were implants the\nimplant acted like it was alive and moved through the body away from\nthe surgeon trying to remove it i\nknew that some of them when they were taken out were minutely\ndissected and i have seen the pictures of that they are\ndevices that signals could be obtained from that were obviously\nintelligent signals they were not random things they were not\nbiological things and yet it was biological material that had\nobviously been engineered for a specific purpose that is really\nincredible i have never seen anything in writing that would lead me to\nbelieve that we had that kind of technology on this planet mm-hm when we are talking about friends or enemies in high\nplaces you feel that was not a particularly friendly thing to\ndo i have no idea it could well have been i would not doubt but\nwhat we have had that from both sides friends and enemies okay i think there are people here there are people that i felt had\ncrucial knowledge to the perpetration of the planet the way we had\nlike it to be and i have seen them saved from disease miraculously but they had had some incident that they seemed to have\na memory of that we would call maybe an abduction or maybe a\nkidnapping and manipulation so they are being helped and supported they are being helped and supported it appears from\nsomewhere our experience would support that all the testimony we have\nreceived from a lot of people it is just interesting to hear\nyour view this is something we did not even talk about\nyesterday well i try to look at everything from a scientific viewpoint from\na really unbiased observational point of view being as i got\ninvolved in quantum physics early which is something that deals a\nlot with probabilities i try to figure the probabilities of\nthings make observations and feel the probabilities well what would this mean from\na probability standpoint what is the probability that it just\nhappened spontaneously and the probabilities are approaching zero what is\nthe probability that we had something that would do this probabilities are zero or very low what is\nthe probability that it might have come from some outside intelligent\nsource the probabilities are up in the you know 99 percent region then after you see one after another after another of\nthese you begin to think you know maybe i am on the right\ntrack here yeah when does it become a reasonable certainty yeah right we have\njust mentioned the testimony from our witness and colleague henry\ndeacon and now you have talked about your experience working with\nquantum physics you told us about sorry let me start this again henry\ntold us about his research work in what some people call signal\nnon-locality or actional\ncommunication at a distance one of the holy grails of physics is to build a working device such\nthat there can be instantaneous communication that can traverse light\nyears in no time is this something which you are able to talk about\nat all do you have any opinions experience or well i have done a number of experiments and i definitely have\nopinions i can say that maxwell was right one of the things i found\nout was this is james james clerk maxwell who wrote the first exposition of\nelectromagnetic theory from a little bit of his work the way i\nlike to describe his work it is like you took a white sheet of\npaper and he took the end of a paintbrush and dipped it in paint and\nmade splotches all over this white sheet of paper he said here\u2019s\nsomething i saw here\u2019s something i believe here\u2019s\nsomething i have experimented on\nand so forth so\nnow you have a white sheet of paper with a lot of splotches which i\nliken to a window that you could peek through just a few holes in the\nwindow and each time you peek through you see something different there is\na lot of the area that was still white that he had not done any\nexperiments in but there were a lot of various areas where he\nactually did something and had experiments that were repeatable and\nwere eventually describable if not explainable so then he took\none large bunch of these and he wrote electromagnetic theory around\nthat now\nthat electromagnetic theory allowed us to build motors and\ngenerators electric motors electric generators radio transmitters television transmitters radio and television receivers computers the internet etcetera etcetera over a period of time so that was\npassed on down through a line of scientists engineers physicists\nand so forth and became those motors and televisions and so forth but\nwhat happened to all the other swatches many of them were never never the knowledge was never continued it was never written\nabout etcetera etcetera so early on i went and replicated most\nof the papers most of the notebooks most of the letters that went\nback and forth and i started looking at some of these other things one\nof the things that got out that people did look at was a thing\ncalled action\nat a distance which meant that something happened in point a and at point b -\nwhich could be clear across the universe \u2013 something could information could be sent from point a to point b faster than the\nspeed of light and\nit did not travel it literally went through some sub-universe\nor parallel universe from a to b instantaneously and with no energy\nrequired just now in canada and in belgium and in france and in\nsome areas in the united states there is a tremendous amount of\nresearch being done in that so it is something that is been known at mit for example for\nmany years but mit knows if they talk about it they got to back up\nand say all\nthe physics we are teaching is not exactly correct so that really has not happened but they want to know that if\nharvard says something that they can say we have\nknown about it for years there\nwas a gentleman that i had met  several occasions that ran a kind\nof an anomalous research institute that found that these things that\nkind of violated the pet laws of physics they continued to take a\nlook at them but they knew that if that actually worked and was\nsomething that could be repeated that they better revise their\nthinking for one reason or another  mostly ego political or\neconomic  a lot of that stuff was not brought out what can you say about whether there were any practically\nfunctioning devices built that were able to utilize this theoretical\nprincipal of communication or action at a distance ah probably nothing okay i remember that henry deacon said that he had actually worked\non these devices he said that the work had been done at livermore\nprior to alanaspects\n\nexperiments in paris in the \u201980s the problem is when you said practical okay now here\u2019s the problem if you have something that works that\ndoes not use electromagnetic radiation you have to develop a\nwhole entirely-new technology like how do you tune it when you\ntune a radio what you are doing is altering the the\nproblem\u2019s with practical we may have a practical technology or not i know that once i get my\nlab built we are going to have a practical technology because\ni have a lot of work that i have done and ideas that i have\ndone and i now need to build a prototype it is\nhow to tune something that does not have a time function so how\ncan you transmit more than one signal at a time then i do not\nnecessarily want to expose that information because not that it is\ngoing to be a billion-dollar product which it would be i mean imagine a cell phone that\u2019ll work anywhere in the universe with\nno energy or such little energy that it is inconsequential or\ninternet that works that way as hal puthoff once said to me \u2013 somebody who i believe you\nonce knew \u2013 is he said to me as\nthe dog said  so many trees and so little time exactly right exactly right so at this point i am going to thank you very much for the\nconversations we have had both yesterday and today we are\nstill on tape we have got some time left here today i am\ngoing to hand over to kerry with the microphone and camera david\nalso wants to ask you some questions about his particular interests\nand we want to make sure that we can capture all of this as we\npossibly can do so with huge reluctance i am going to get out\nfrom behind this camera because i had love to talk to you for\nhours more i hope we are going to get this opportunity later and right now i am going to hand over to kerry thank you very much for your interest okay music\nfades in been\ninvolved with trying to build flying saucers \u2013 you usually\nfound with flying saucers if you look at most of the movies there\nalways seems to be a robot involved with it kerry\ncassidy (kc alfred webre is the originator of the term\n\"exopolitics for those of you that do not know that and he is actually a \"futurist he is an amazing thinker he\nwas in this field doing things and thinking things before most people\nhad any idea even in ufology how to really think about this whole\nconcept that we are not alone in the universe so i just want to give\nkudos to him and really honor him for that he is\nalso been umhow do i put this he is undergone heavy-duty\nsurveillance and other kinds of things he is canadian but obviously he was on the target list for the\npowers that be for quite a long time and actually he is had to\nweather all kinds of stuff that he does not even talk about i know\nthis because of my intuitive ability but also because i followed his\nwork actually long before camelot so i just want to really honor\nhim for that other\nthan that i think we can just give him the microphone and let him\nbegin to talk because he is very knowledgeable in so many\nways are you hooked up here with this alfred\nwebre (aw yes am i thank\nyou very very much kerry and i want to thank project camelot who\nare really providing i think in my humble opinion a leading edge if not the leading edge platform for whistleblowers to come forth on\nthe issues that will create a positive future for us and\non that note that is the note that i will be sharing with you in a\npowerpoint on solar cycle 24 solar cycle 24 is the one that is just\nstarting now \u2013 2009 to 2020 and\nby 2020 we will be roughly into the beginnings of a golden\nage so i know that it is very hard to go from \u201cthe problem\nstatement to a golden age but that is roughly the\nprocess that we are in now if\nwe look at solar cycle 24 which we will be seeing all the graphs and\npictures of the solar maximum will be in 2012 to 2013 specifically some say in may of 2013 what that means \u2013 and\nwe will share some of this \u2013 is that there is the index of\nhuman excitability which has been plotted by a russian scientist\ngoing back to 500 bc what he is plotted is that about 80% of the\nrevolutions the wars and the breakthroughs in human society at the\ncollective level happened at the solar maximum kerry\nand alfred spend a few minutes testing the powerpoint] thank you kerry thank you well as we were saying this presentation and there are about 60 slides\nhere so i will tend to go through them on a relatively quick basis following the trend from 2009 to 2020 and we will be going kind of on\na macrocosmic scale on much of this slide\nof milky way] that is the picture of our own galaxy the milky way\ngalaxy and we will also be getting into the axis of which is a\ngalactic center black hole at the center of our galaxy and now it\nturns out that science is discovering as you might have suspected a\nuniversal axis not only a galactic axis but a universal\naxis so\nthe synchrony that we are going through now is occurring not only at\nthe individual level at the planetary level at the solar level at\nthe galactic level but at the universal level so it is not only just us here \u2013 it is huge and the universe is\nreally the source of our thoughts we just think that we have private\nthoughts but it is coming at the galactic level and at the universal\nlevel so one message for that is - relax and enjoy it laughs\nalong with audience]\n\n\n[slide\ntitled exopolitics 2009 \u2013 2020 solar cycle & a golden age alfred lambremont webre jd m.ed www.exopolitics.com\nshowing the topics listed below now we will be covering i solar cycle 24 which is a perfect storm\nii galactic alignment\niii exopolitics & the time acceleration matrix time\nis actually accelerating as we speak as we sit here because time is\nnot a constant and exopolitics is the new political science of outer\nspace it is the science of relations between our human\ncivilization and other civilizations in the multiverse we will\nbe talking about iv positive outcomes of solar cycle 24 and\nv strategies & solutions\n\n\n[slide\nof nasa data] well welcome to solar cycle 24 2009 to 2020 there\nare many predictions of what the amplitude of solar cycle 24 will be as you can see from this graph by nasa some think that it is\ngoing to be very low amplitude and some think that it is going\nto be very high amplitude \u2013 so we are in a position of\nmaximal uncertainty now although\nsome information about solar cycle 25 is coming in most of the\npredictions are only within this cycle that is 2009 to 2020 and so\ni like focusing amongst many other reasons on solar cycle 24 (2009\n\u2013 2020 because it gets us out of the 2012 meme and\nsays hey it is a cycle okay right now we are in a deep solar minimum and there is\nabout a 50-year low in solar wind pressure what this means is that\nthere will be fewer geomagnetic storms that theoretically can affect\nall the computer equipment and satellites and other things that we\nhave here on earth we\ncontinue to be in a deep solar minimum and the sun\u2019s brightness\nis dropping we are in the deepest solar minimum in\nnearly a century sunspot\nmagnetism which you can see plotted there on the graph is on the\ndecline it may be that sunspots will be increasing because\nwe are in such uncertainty you can remember seeing from the\ngraph at the beginning that sunspot cycles may be picking up by the\nend of 2009 to be followed by a solar maximum of below-average\nintensity in 2012 or 2013 however there is another view of this and that is that if the sun continues to\nbecome more quiet we will be going into a territory of historic\nminimum and a quiet sun will cause temperatures globally to take\na nosedive this is contrary to the global warming argument so we are in a period of maximum uncertainty if\nthis version is coming forward which there is some basis for\nit temperatures are actually falling around the globe not getting\nwarmer and we know already that from 1998 the lower troposphere\ntemperatures globally have fallen around half a degree celsius due to\nthe quiet sun so it is necessary to go deeper than the \u201cglobal\nwarming headlines to really understand the dynamics however if we do have a dalton minimum or a maunder minimum which are referred to historically \u2013 low sun minima \u2013\nthe main effect will be to have famine and starvation worldwide due\nto shortened growing seasons and harsher weather and\nso we may be headed into what is called a mini ice age \u2013\nand we do not know \u2013 and we are at 2009 so that is the degree of\nuncertainty it is the principle the more you know the more you\ndo not know so some of the evidence is that solar cycle 25 which will be peaking\naround 2022 (it starts in 2020 could be one of the weakest\nsolar cycles in centuries and that is connected to a possible mini\nice age that is because the conveyor belt system on the sun is\nbeginning to weaken now in the midst of all this we have a national academy of sciences\nreport from january \u201909 which says that 2012 to 2013 the solar\nmaximum may actually bring the perfect storm in other\nwords solar flares and systems collapse of our current\ninfrastructure around the planet \u2013 our energy infrastructure the\nnational academy of sciences report looks at the possibility that if\nwe do have a repetition of the 8-day 1859 carrington event \u2013\na very large solar flare that essentially destroyed the telegraphic\nsystem worldwide which was the electrical system at that time \u2013\nin the us the damage could be as high as $2 trillion with millions\ndead (this is from the report itself and it is questionable whether\nthe us would ever bounce back now we are talking about 2012 to 2013 moreover nasa has now discovered that there is a hole in the earth's magnetic\nfield which is ten times as large as was previously thought the\nmagnetosphere is what protects the earth from the impact of solar\nflares and it could be that up to 20 times the amount of solar\nplasma could enter the earth than before so we have a\nforce-multiplier of a solar flare with a hole in the magnetosphere\nhere looking at the \u201cworst case scenario we are\nlooking at a solar maximum which will be around may of 2013 and one\nscientist says it is the perfect sequence for a very big event if\na solar flare should load the magnetosphere with plasma just before a\nsolar storm occurs we\nhave to remember that we are in a deep solar minimum which\ntends to lessen solar storms so there are all these variables that\nare occurring at once this is a map from the national academy of sciences study which shows\ntotal collapse the orange areas on both coasts show the total\ncollapse of the electrical grid and the red  are vulnerable\ntransformers this is where the estimate of \"millions dead has come from \u2013 knocking out about 300 key transformers cutting power to 130-million people and the coronal mass ejection from the 1859 carrington event arrived on\nearth faster than our early warning system now china\nand europe are equally vulnerable china\u2019s actually installing\na high-power electrical grid that is more vulnerable than that of the\nu.s and europe and the other developed nations will be similarly\nimpacted what is important is that as far as a reality check the\nhead of the european space agency space weather says this is a\nfair and balanced report so that is some of the possibilities now these are the g-20 with the queen if we look at the obama white\nhouse website and ask about 2012 2013 the only thing that is on the\nwebsite as far as energy policy is that the u.s wants to ensure that\nten percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012 so that is a policy statement and this is entirely off the\nradar so\nhere's a key question obviously if we had smart leadership at the\nhelm of the planet we would be getting off the grid and we had be\nusing some of the non-polluting zero-point energy sources such as\nanti-gravity technology and important teleportation technology which\nwould revolutionize transport on this planet and which are available\nnow on an operational basis in the black budget economy so\nthe question is are we being set up to fail and suffer an effective\nsystems collapse if the 2012 to 2013 solar flares materialize now here are some other impacts \u2013 the effect of solar cycle 24\non human behavior and that is that sunspots give off solar flares\nthat increase negative ionization on earth and increased negative\nionization during sunspot maximum periods increases human\nexcitability and activity so some of the regularities in studying\npast solar cycles is that there is a definite tendency for\npandemics to occur during solar maxima now the current h1n1 virus may be being manipulated and it is\nbeing manipulated at a time in which if we go back centuries we\nknow that there is a tendency for pandemics to occur and this is\ndating back to the early 1700's so if there is an attempt in the h1n1 virus and the mandatory\nvaccination scheme then it is truly diabolical because people are\nworking with historical data that shows that there is a tendency for\npandemics to occur some\nof the research shows that geomagnetic storms cause different\nreactions primarily in males women seem to experience less change\nin accordance with the sun's behavior men may become increasingly\nirritable and aggressive \u2013 either that or they become more\ncreative to\nbe made there but\nthis brings us to the index of human excitability which was\ndeveloped by a soviet professor he traced the incidence of wars revolutions-rise expeditions and migrations from 500 bc to 1922 ad what\nhe shows is that he divided them into four periods and showed that\nin period two and three \u2013 which correspond to 2010 to 2011 which is coming up in this next year and 2012 to 2014 \u2013 there\nis to take the maximum in 2012 to 2014 it is the maximum\nexcitability the election of liberals or radicals mass\ndemonstrations riots revolutions war and the resolution of most\npressing demands so that is what has occurred historically during the\nsolar maxima now there is (and we do not have time to get into it today but we do have\nanother powerpoint which shows the effect of a spaced-based weapon of\nmass destruction known as haarp which you may have heard of and its\ndemonstrated mood and mind control ability so we do not know haarp\nis another variable which may be off-setting the effects of the index\nof human mass excitability and the effects during the solar\nmaximum of sunspots in that haarp can render entire populations\nextremely apathetic and confused there is deep evidence that that is\noccurring we may have intersecting variables here one reason why\nour body politic is so apathetic  sources from systematic mind\ncontrol through technologies such as haarp but\nit is also related to the sunspot cycles in that we are in a deep solar\nminimum now i mean there is all these outrages happening and the\nhuman population seems relatively apathetic to begin to move around\nit but\nthis data is very hopeful because if we have a rapid swing in\nsunspots over the next few years it will be hopefully not the time\nfor wars but the time for social breakthroughs this\nbrings us to several possible visions that we can have of solar cycle\n24 2009 to 2020 the\ndisintegration vision is global and regional wars \u2013 the\narmageddon meme this is the meme employed by the\npermanent war economy whose business it is to promote war as an\nindustrial activity and to keep us organized around war within the\ndialectic of \u201cenemies to have all of our productive\ncapacity and our mental capacity and our emotional capacity (our\nfears directed towards war which is an industrial activity like\nmaking shoes i\nshould say that back in the mid-\u201970's when i was a futurist at\nstanford research institute that was being actively studied there \u2013\nthat is the break-up of the u.s into about five or six\nregion-nations and so in my mind there is a question as to whether\nthat is an attempted social engineering to deconstruct what is one of\nthe advanced democracies that could be a positive force is\nthis the outcome of solar cycle 24 well there is an alternative vision it is kind of is the glass\nhalf-empty or the glass half-full or rose-colored glasses\n\u2013 and that is peaceful conflict-resolution right\nnow money is actually the private property of a very small group of\npeople the u.s dollar until now has been the reserve currency for\nthe world but the dollar bills that you have in your pocket are\nactually the property of the federal reserve bank \u2013 you only\nhave a temporary license to use them the\nfederal reserve bank according to a 1976 u.s senate sub-committee\nstudy (which we have online just google 911 war crimes\ntribunal the federal reserve bank is actually beneficially\nowned by one family and that is the rothschild family which is\nheadquartered in london and france this\nis a very grounded study which was done of the ownership of the banks\nthat in turn own the federal reserve system so we have one family\nthat owns all of the currency in the world and the currency itself\nis private property of that family well in fact money should be a public utility like electricity or\nlike water with public central banks then if you wanted to start a\nbusiness well the bank would just provide money to you in the same\nway that it provides electricity to your workshop and water and\npublic transportation so it is a whole transformation that can happen\nwith regard to money we have\nbuilt these concrete roads which take away all the green space cities are designed around the automobile and we are using explosions\nand polluting fossil fuel to move these heavy hunks of steel to\ntransfer maybe one or two persons well teleportation\nis an actual mechanism now if you go to www.examiner.com i have got a column there \u2013 just enter my name alfred webre in the search \u2013 and this past week we released an article which\nis now the number one political examiner article in the usa it is at\nthe top it is being read more than any political examiner article in\nthe u.s and that is that two whistleblowers have now come forth and\nconfirmed that they have teleported from earth to mars and met with\nmartian extraterrestrials both\nof those whistleblowers are affiliated with project camelot \u2013\narthur neumann who is been using a name to protect himself up until\nnow (henry deacon and andrew\nbasiago who is a colleague of mine in the mars anomaly research\nsociety so we now have definite proof and whistleblowers \u2013 a very high\nlevel of evidence \u2013 that teleportation is being employed in the\nnational security state and that could revolutionize our\nentire society and will revolutionize our society i\nthink i can share this because andrew my colleague has now shared\nit he was enrolled as a child participant in a darpa time travel\nprogram by the u.s which the u.s we know definitively now has had\nthe ability to time travel either by chronovisor  kind of a\ntelevision or a three-dimensional hologram that looks at forward and\npast scenes and via actual teleportation devices andrew\nhas been to the year 2045 and it is a beautiful earth there is a lot\nof greenery and the cities are all kind of ecological and they are\nconcentrated so\nwe have a peaceful future say about 30 or 40 years from now and\nit is just this transition that we are going through so there have been people who have been to the future on a physical\nbasis for the united states government bringing back information\nfrom the future to the past to help humanity plan for the future and\nit is quite positive so\nit is important to stay focused on the fact that we are going toward a\npositive future because that way we create it now what we will be seeing also is that our very dna as we speak is being\ntransformed by cosmic forces by the galactic center black hole which\nis acting as sort of a gigantic laser beam  to transform our\ndna to be able to handle a multi-dimensional future in which\nwe are once again interacting with the rest of organized society in\nthe universe and to also bring us into an era of non-dualistic\nconsciousness these\nare some of the changes that will be occurring that we are living\nthrough now and will be occurring during solar cycle 24 on an\nintense basis from 2009 to 2020 so these can be the outcomes of solar cycle 24 \u2013 a transformation\nvision rather than a disintegration vision and it depends\none where one wants to put one's energy and what sort of holistic\nvision one wants to maintain now we should also talk about the fact that we are going through the\nplane of the galactic center black hole if we look at our milky way\ngalaxy it looks kind of like a pancake with a galactic center black\nhole at the center it is about 100,000 light-years across there are\nabout 200- to 400-billion star systems in it at\nthe center of the galaxy is a massive black hole about four-million\ntimes the density of our sun and that black hole spins around once\nevery eleven minutes as opposed to our earth which spins around once\nevery 24 hours and our sun which revolves about once a month so\nthe galactic center black hole and now science has confirmed that\nevery galaxy most galaxies have a black hole at their center it is\nlike the engine of the galaxy which at the physical level is creating\nthe stars and various other celestial matter and at other dimensional\nlevels is creating life and consciousness dna\nis being affected by the galactic center black hole and our very\nconsciousness we tend to think that again our thoughts are our\nown there are our thoughts our individual little radio-receptor\nbrains and minds are picking up a vast field a morphogenic\nfield that is being broadcast by the galactic center black\nhole indeed by the universal axis at once to all this is another view of the milky way galaxy you can see how it is a\npancake with a galactic center black hole at the center now this is the galactic center black hole the plane\nof our solar system is now passing through the plane of the galactic\ncenter black hole it is a 36-year journey it started in 1980 and\nwill go to 2016 so we are going through the plane of the galactic\ncenter black hole right now this\ngalactic alignment occurs about once every 12,800 years that is another schematic which shows how the plane is going through it takes about 36 years there\nmay be earth changes during this time some of the theories of the\nearth changes are interesting one is a galactic superwave\ntheory and that is looking at the galaxy as an enormous volcano with\nthe galactic center sort of the center and galactic bursts\noccur which are sent out in a superwave fashion taking debris and\nmaterial throughout the galaxy another\nsource of possible earth changes would be celestial bodies entering\nthe solar system like what occurred in 9500 bc which is when a\nportion \u2013 fragments \u2013 of this vela supernova entered the\nsolar system and apparently collided with mars which was then an\nactive verdant planet with a common human society with our earth and destroyed the ecology of mars so that now it is a very\nfragile ecology the survivors are an intelligent human civilization\nliving under the surface of mars this\nhit earth also and destroyed our great maritime civilization which\nplato called atlantis which was the \u201clast world so we\nhumans have gone through a very severe trauma in the last 11,500\nyears with the 9500 bc solar system catastrophe what\nwriter barbara hand clow says is that one of the reasons why we have\nsuch genetic and embedded fear of impending catastrophe is we have\ncatastrophobia and it is the memory of the 9500 bc solar system\ncatastrophe that is our future is going to be relatively stable -\nit is our collective psyche which is unstable the\ngalactic center black hole may have energy bursts which may change flip or wobble the earth these are the possible sources but again\nwe have to look at this within the lens of catastrophobia one\nresearcher has codified a time acceleration matrix for the\ngalactic alignment and that is the concept that time is really\naccelerating we are in the space-time dimension and the dimension of\ntime is accelerating oh my god it is saturday again you know how did that happen what\nhe says is that we are coming into a period of human enlightenment the disappearance of national borders divinely-guided anarchy and\nthe strengthening of the east so you know this is part of the\nthing that is occurring we are\nalso going through a photon band which may be a force to\nincrease our consciousness and as we just mentioned the rate of\nchange is accelerating \u2013 and that is that there will be 20\ntimes as much change and transformation in the period february to\ndecember 2011 as there was during the period 1999 to january 2011 so 20 times as much change in that single year as between 1999 when\nthe internet really started in full swing to 2011 so we are in this\ntime acceleration matrix exopolitics\nis a science and as a science of relations between our human\ncivilization and other intelligent civilizations in the universe provides a framework of interface by which our civilization on a\nsocietal basis can begin to interface with other extraterrestrial\nand interdimensional civilizations one\ncan say when positing the future that the degree of conscious\ninteraction and cooperation amongst human society and advanced\nethical extraterrestrial civilizations will be a determining factor\nin a positive human future right\nnow there appears by the evidence to be a long-standing strategic\nrelationship between the martian civilization and the human\ncivilization \u2013 at least in terms of u.s bases on mars and\nmartians openly working in hughes aircraft as we have witnesses of\nthat my\ncolleague andrew basiago in 1971 in the company of his father who\nwas a cia contractor met three martian astronauts at curtis-wright\nfield in new jersey who were visiting on a liaison mission so our task now is to make all of that which is occurring in the covert\nworld \u2013 in the subconscious as it were \u2013 to bring it\ninto public light that is part of the survival mechanism and\nexopolitics is the conceptual structure that makes that possible in\nfact we can say that exopolitics may function as the new survival\nscience for humanity here\n we have for example a crop circle pattern that seems to be\nthe same spiral pattern as our milky way galaxy suggesting that many\nof these concepts are being played for us in a multi-dimensional way this is the time acceleration matrix for galactic alignment dr carl johan calleman and barbara hand clow have developed this and it begins to show by going through various eras of human history\nhow time accelerates for each of these periods there is 20 times as\nmuch change in the next period for\nexample in the national period from 3115 bc to 1755 ad well in the next period starting just before the french revolution the american revolution etcetera up to the beginning of the\ninternet well in the planetary period there is 20\ntimes as much change as there was during the national and\nwhen we go to the galactic period from january 1999 to\nfebruary 2011 that is when all these thoughts of the galaxy start\ncoming humanity goes galactic we have all this interest in\nbattlestar galactica everyone becomes interested in\nextraterrestrial issues on a planetary basis well that is all coming from the galactic center black hole and from the\nemanations at the universal level there is 20 times as much change\nthere as there was during the planetary period in terms of\nbringing us up to a frequency and knowledge and information and\ncognitive basis to be able to participate as citizens of a\nmulti-dimensional highly-organized and populated universe and\nthat is just a prelude to the universal era which starts at\nthe beginning of 2011 in terms of the broadcast now some people may\nbe right on the broadcast you know we each interpret it according\nto our individual transducers which are in our brains and in our\nminds and in our extended bodies if\nwe look at what the mayan calendar is then it is really a mind-map it is not a calendar where you want to keep time it is a mind-map\nbecause it maps what sorts of things humanity is going to have on its\nmind at any particular time and\n2011 and 2012 is just the start of the universal era on earth those are the signals that are being broadcast from the galactic\ncenter black hole which the mayans called hunab-ku now if we just look for example at the galactic period which\nstarted in 1999 that is when the center of the galaxy started\nbroadcasting the whole the galactic well if you look at\nthe year 1999 that is when the first book exopolitics was\nwritten because that is what is\nhappening those were the signals being broadcast by the\ngalaxy so all of this is kind of coming out in a \"matrix\"\nway i\nhave just a few copies of this that i managed to smuggle through u.s customs down to here for those who'd like to buy it not smuggle you cannot bring books through on the aircraft but i said that they\nwere pamphlets so there you go slide\nof chart titled time acceleration matrix] then we had the\nfirst scholarly conference on exopolitics in the year 2000 and we had\nother scholars come in by\nthe year 2003 that is when the first nation-state mexico began to\ndisclose its ufo/extraterrestrial files in earnest in\n2004 and 2005 that is when brazil peru and chile began to\ndisclose the former deputy prime minister of canada paul hellyer gave a speech then in which he said oh ufo's are as real as the\nairplanes over your head and the u.s government is planning to try\nto start an intergalactic war so we have to do something about it in\nthe beginning of 2006 the associated press reported that exopolitics\nhad been nominated for word of the year for 2005 so we begin to get\ninto the culture these memes begin to get into the culture\n\u2013 these survival memes in\n2007 we had the chicago/o\u2019hare sighting france and the united\nkingdom disclosed their ufo files we\nhad the former governor of arizona say that yes the spacecraft\nwhich was a mile on a side which flew over phoenix arizona on march\n13 1997 was an extraterrestrial spacecraft and i am sorry i did what\ni did and try to cover it up that happened in 2006 in\nthe beginning of 2007 we could go into the chicago/o\u2019hare\nsighting this is very interesting just to make it brief a 60-foot\nufo came down at united gate c-17 at chicago/o\u2019hare airport\n(i have been to that gate about 4:00 in the afternoon it was\nwitnessed by the plane the ground crew the tower the faa got\ninvolved and it was all over the major media it came down there on\nnovember 7 2006 there is\na theory which we wrote about about 20 years ago called the context\ncommunication theory of extraterrestrial communications which is\nthat all ufos are like dreams \u2013 they are communication\nfrom a higher intelligent source they are like dreams of\ncommunications from your subconscious to your conscious well november 7 2006 what day was that that was the u.s mid-term\nelection in which the neocons lost control of both houses of\ncongress and i was a civil liberties lawyer you know working in\nthat field also and you know a police state was about to take over\nin the u.s in\nfact that sighting on mid-term election day was when the shift\nhappened in both houses of congress and with the election then in\n2008 which also brought about the collapse of the old financial\nstructure during what is called the fifth night of the\ngalactic underworld in\nother words all of these \u2013 the collapse of the economic\nstructure \u2013 is because things that are hierarchal and are based\non control and are not sustainable are being all collapsed now\nbecause that is the programming coming out from the galactic\ncenter black hole so it is all happening according to a large\nschedule now we are apparently in the sixth day from november \u201908\nto november \u201909 of the galactic underworld what\nhappened on december 12 2008 that is when the discovery of\nlife on mars happened in the nasa photographs of the nasa rover spirit which is on the surface of mars it photographed humanoids animals structures on mars and you can go to www.exopolitics.com\nand see scientific papers \u2013 there are over 40 documents they are all free to download so\nall of this is what is happening according to the drivers behind\nthe universe at the galactic level and at the universe level so it is all good and\nso we can look forward to more disclosure we can look forward to\nmore positive things occurring as the old structures collapse the\nthing is not to identify and suffer for the old structures now what are some of the positive outcomes well spottiswoode and here i want to\nacknowledge the research and insights of david wilcock who has\nprovided a lot of the energy and insights for looking at how these\nprocesses are resulting in a positive future for example spottiswoode a psychologist researcher from palo\nalto california each day at that time of the day when we are\nmost aligned with galactic center \u2013 and you can see the spike\non the graph there \u2013 our psychic ability increases 400 percent so the more we are aligned with the galactic center black hole and the galactic center and the universe axis the more psychic we\nare the more we are in change i have\ndone meditation exercises where i meditate on the galactic center i\nmean you know that is where it is coming from as david wilcock has said the energy of the galaxy is\ndirectly tied in with the evolution of the human species by raising\nits level of consciousness this is coming as with the certainty as\nthe streams flow now one of the mechanisms is dna activation and peter gariaev \u2013\nscientist dr peter gariaev \u2013 was able to transform a frog\nembryo into a salamander by shining a laser through the salamander\nembryo and re-directing it into the frog embryo and the frog dna\ntransformed into a salamander at\nthe galactic level that is what is occurring now the galactic\ncenter black hole is the analog to the laser and we are being\ntransformed at the dna level so the more that we open ourselves up\nto that the easier nature can take its course the\ngalactic centers contain the pattern to transform all dna on the\nplanet and they provide a sufficiently large source of energy to\nenable the transformation to take place that is\ndavid wilcock expressing that realization it is even occurring at the galactic level and if we look at that that looks like a two-strand dna correct well if you look at that it is the dna nebula which is 80\nlight-years long and 300 light-years from the galactic center black\nhole this is the first time that the dna double helix commonly seen\ninside living organisms has been observed in the cosmos in other\nwords our galaxy is a living organism so these changes are happening at the galactic level and we can take\nwhat is called the transposition burst as a plausible mechanism\nby which the galactic burst can activate our dna which\nis proved in the gariaev experiment with the laser so now we have a\nmodel for this kelleher\ncalls the outcome of this product a light-body which is\nwhat is been described as the dimensional existence of the\nupper-dimensional ethical extraterrestrials we are in more and more\nrefined energy bodies so what is the boundary 2011 2013 2012 these are boundaries in\nwhich these mechanisms of transposition bursts from the\ngalactic center are happening and they are happening now dr john jay harper talks about that 97 percent of our dna is now\nconsidered junk dna and it is that dna which is being\nactivated so we are receiving an upgrade from the inside \u2013\nhumans version 2.0 endogenous\ndmt produced in our brains could also bring about what some people\ncall a collective near-death experience that may occur these are some of the factors that may occur we will have a collective\nnear-death experience and really go up into our light-bodies our\nextended bodies as a species that will be an interesting\none so endogenous dmt can be posited as a purveyor of the transformed\nconsciousness i am very sorry we are at a little past 12:30 there is not any more\ntime to go any further into this okay what we can do is alfred you will make your presentation perhaps\navailable to people so that they can follow up on the final pages yeah sure i am not sure how far along we are we are almost at the end this is slide 53 of about 60 slides so the\nbulk of the information has been transmitted \u2013 and of the\ninsight okay we would be glad to give alfred a couple of minutes to\nactually sum up the presentation if you had like to do so sure well that we are coming into and we are in an\nera of tremendous opportunity which is occurring regardless of our\nindividual thoughts so\nit makes good sense if one is in resistance to change one\u2019s\nthoughts and to really tune into what is occurring at the galactic and\nuniversal levels which is part of a universe program to allow us to\ncome into the universal age which we know by people who have\ngone to the future physically and come back is going to be on\nour planet by the year 2045 or 2050 which is just 40 years away so\nit is a positive future that is coming i will\nbe here i will be in the back i have brought some copies of the\nbook exopolitics\nwhich founded this whole field and if you want more information please stay tuned to www.exopolitics.com thank\nyou there are some fascinating areas that could be investigated further\nthat he is been touching on and some of that information is\navailable from our whistleblowers on project camelot we\nhave another recent interview that talks about the galactic\nsuperwave paul laviolette is the scientist responsible for that\nconcept and he is done a lot of investigation we visited him in\ngreece and did a recent interview we have yet to edit it we have\nbeen so busy but i just wanted to let you know that that is in the\narea some of which alfred was referring to kerry cassidy (kc hi i am kerry cassidy from project\n                  camelot and we are here with dr brian o\u2019leary he is a lecturer scientist ex-astronaut and we are\n                  very pleased to be with him today and we are here in\n                  beautiful ecuador at montesuenos which is your retreat i\n                  think you want to call it what we want to do is kind of get\n                  into your background dr brian o\u2019leary (bo\u2019l yes i am\n                  afraid that at my ripe old age of 69 that my background has\n                  been pretty eclectic and it is kind of hard to pin me\n                  down like you know who is this guy but it all started back when i was a little kid and i wanted\n                  to go into space i wanted to go to the moon i wanted to go\n                  to mars and there was no space program then and then somewhat\n                  ironically i got involved in the apollo program twelve years\n                  after i wanted to go into space and nobody thought there would\n                  ever be a space program this was back in the late \u201940s early \u201950s but\n                  when sputnik went up then the whole world changed and it\n                  was also around then that there was more awareness of the ufo\n                  phenomenon paranormal phenomena and so what happened with me was that i went on one track which was a very ambitious career which was actually quite\n                  fulfilled because i became an astronaut after getting my phd\n                  in astronomy at berkeley and then i got involved in planetary exploration some of\n                  the mariner programs i taught with carl sagan at cornell university\n                  and did research on planetary science then i went to washington became an advisor to various political\n                  leaders various presidential candidates.i was kind of like an \u201cacademic drifter in many\n                  ways even though on paper i was successful i would be kind\n                  of hopping from university to university and this i think helped prepare the way for the later half of my life which\n                  was really quite different from the first half the first half was more traditional more being a physicist\n                  who was very familiar with for example energy and environment\n                  issues having advised congress and having taught courses on\n                  it i was also aware of atmospheric science and some of the things\n                  that were ahead for the earth which are now very familiar such as global warming global climate change and a number\n                  of other human-related catastrophes that are happening on the\n                  earth now.so in a sense my own straight academic background was a\n                  good one good preparation for studying energy policy what\n                  kind of choices do we really have in the energy crisis but\n                  also to what degree are humans interfering with the earth and so the second half of my life if you will after i was\n                  in the physics department at princeton in 1979 i started to\n                  have some unusual experiences  remote viewing experiences a near-death experience various healing experiences then that\n                  opened pandora\u2019s box up i was at that time in the physics department at princeton my colleagues many of them nobel laureates all men thought i was crazy to embrace paranormal phenomena then later i got into the ufo phenomena i led a number of\n                  scientific groups to get together to try to disclose the research\n                  that was going on and it was around that time i began to get in touch with all\n                  the \u201cblack projects not from the inside but\n                  from the outside kind of peering in and seeing what was happening that there is been this massive cover-up.well one thing led to another i spent a number of years\n                  after i left princeton  and now we are getting into\n                  the \u201980s  of exploring various things like the \u201cface\u201don\n                  mars nasa\u2019s cover-up of that and looking further at\n                  the ufo phenomena i published a number of books a trilogy basically in which\n                  i kind of review the state of the art of \u201cnew science or science-outside-the-box-of-western-thinking so we have for example in this book [exploring\n                    inner and outer space] i talk about the state of the\n                    art of ufo research but i also talk about consciousness the mind-over-matter interaction the fact that exploring\n                    outer space and exploring inner space can lead to all sorts\n                    of new paradigms of reality then in the second coming of science this book\n                  here i did some very careful studies that replicated the work\n                  of many pioneers of new science  people such as marcel vogel i would go and visit various miracle-makers like sai baba and saw him materialize things i went all over the world i went to brazil to visit thomaz green morton a very gifted\n                  psychic then i began to get more interested in the environment at\n                  that point i published miracle in the void which\n                  was a photo-journalistic look at some of the best and brightest\n                  free energy researchers all over the world  india japan and so forth i began to realize that we could solve our energy\n                  problem really quite quickly if we only embrace these technologies however they have been suppressed and sometimes violently\n                  suppressed so in this book miracle in the void which was really\n                  a collaboration with my wife meredith an artist she\n                  was painting her masterpiece the last supper of gaia while\n                  i was writing this book and what i discovered was that paradigm shifts are more a\n                  social political phenomenon than a technological question that it goes way beyond the drama of outside researchers coming\n                  up with breakthroughs which then are suppressed it has to do with creating whole new structures\n                  which are unsupported by the larger culture in fact what is happening now on the planet is that\n                  we are grieving the loss of mother earth and even though this\n                  is a subconscious thing what happens is that according to\n                  the work of elisabeth kubler-ross we go through various phases\n                  of grieving  grieving the loss of our mother planet so meredith and i became avid environmentalists what i attempted\n                  to do then  and now we are talking the middle 1990s\n                   was to examine what psychological effects come through each\n                  of us as we begin to embrace the new paradigm meredith and i collaborated on this project what we were\n                  able to identify  and this is based on the work of elisabeth\n                  kubler-ross on death and dying  is that we have\n                  all grieving the loss of mother earth by all i mean\n                  those of us that are sensitive and aware of the problems that\n                  are unfolding on the planet.what meredith and i figured out was that many of us are in\n                  denial  most of us  about the severity of the problems such as global climate change such as the possibility of nuclear\n                  war the war in iraq and so forth and so on that these\n                  things fly in the face of what we really need to be\n                  doing which is developing clean energy making sure we have\n                  clean water having an international system of justice depending\n                  more and more on local resources local rule and but anyway most people are in denial about everything including the ufo phenomenon and free energy which are two\n                  of my favorite topics both of which i have found for\n                  myself are very free.so then we go from denial on to anger the truth\u2019ll\n                    set you free but first it will piss you off then we go into bargaining how can we fit the new within\n                    the context of the old a lot of people were stimulated by barack obama\u2019s comments\n                  about how we need change well the kind of change\n                  that would be implemented there is what i call incremental change tiny little things and then meanwhile the progressives that are trying to nip\n                  on his heels are saying well we need structural change we need to go back to the constitution we need to have a kind\n                  of rooseveltian new deal and keynesian economy we need something\n                  that is like going back to a point of reference like the roosevelt\n                  or clinton administration and that is not going to work so when none of these\n                  things work then according to the work of elisabeth kubler-ross then we go into depression a lot of people are depressed i have noticed this a\n                  lot of people especially in the us they are just not\n                  very happy with what is going on that happens also when\n                  people lose their loved ones they get depressed after denial anger and bargaining and then finally people get into acceptance.the point here is that the earth is getting ruined by human\n                  intervention i mean it is so obvious and we need to seek the truth so part of what i did was\n                  publish a book called re-inheriting the earth which\n                  was awakening to sustainable solutions and many of them lie\n                  far outside the box of conventional thinking that is why i am so interested in the free energy\n                  question very interested in some of the questions of ways\n                  of purifying water in ways that have not been acknowledged\n                  before i am very interested in the phenomena of consciousness how combined positive human intention can really and truly\n                  change the material world these are ideas now that are proven\n                  by quantum physics and paranormal phenomena and so this whole array of solutions  in principle  could\n                  work if only we can change the system only if we\n                  could change our governance our public awareness and education so that is what i have been all about in the last\n                  few years my most recent book is called the energy solution\n                  revolution which is based on my 20 years of experience\n                  at examining the proofs-of-concept of free energy devices by free energy i mean free energy is\n                  sometimes a funny word maybe we could use the word solution\n                  energy these represent quantum-leap breakthroughs from what we now\n                  know it is going way beyond solar and wind in term of\n                  cleanliness it is actually it is sort of analogous to \u201cthe\n                  information age who would have ever imagined that computers\n                  and internet would have existed even 20 years ago it was\n                  only a small number of people who foresaw that what i foresee along with many colleagues who have been\n                  suppressed is that we can have a free energy or a solution\n                  energy culture in the world by solution energy i mean vacuum energy  energy\n                  from the vacuum of space  which is well known to the yogis that everywhere has enormous amounts of potential\n                  energy if we can only tap into it and there are ways of tapping\n                  into it so some of my world travels and the work of my colleagues and various professional organizations has proven beyond\n                  any reasonable doubt that these forms of energy are unprecedented they do exist the wright brothers have already flown on this\n                  one we are just not making practical use the reason why we are not making practical use of these\n                  energy sources is because they are suppressed actively the people that work on these things are threatened assassinated and manipulated bought off when somebody gets near realization that is when the big boys go in and this has happened\n                  again and again and again.so that is a very important part of the awareness training\n                  of the general public it is also part of the very important\n                  work that project camelot is doing which is to interview\n                  many people formerly on the inside maybe still on the inside i have never been on the inside but i sure know how the\n                  inside works and what their agenda is and their motivations which flies in the face of development potential development of free energy and we all know also and many people do not quite understand\n                  it is well if it is real then we had have it\n                  by now just go down to k-mart and get my little solid-state\n                  power-pack and we can go off the grid system everything\n                  is clean everybody\u2019s happy but it does not quite work out that way it takes money\n                  and time to develop it so we need an apollo program for new\n                  energy  new energy meaning vacuum energy cold fusion advanced hydrogen and water technologies there is quite a long list of technologies any one of\n                  which would do it but it is going to take effort to develop\n                  these energy sources so in the energy solution revolution i address\n                  less the technical issues because the internet and the general\n                  literature\u2019s just full of information on the technologies\n                  themselves but instead i have looked at the political\n                  and social questions and the educational questions you know why is it that otherwise intelligent people\n                    would not embrace this possibility if it is going to solve\n                    the energy problem and of course people do not\n                    do it for a number of reasons there\u2019ve been a number\n                    of studies done it is really a social science question\n                    as to why there is such resistance to this change.bertrand russell one time said the resistance to a new\n                    idea increases as the square of its importance if we are talking about supplanting a four-billion-dollar\n                  energy industry highly polluting with a clean energy that is\n                  cheap and decentralized then we are talking about a paradigm\n                  shift and the powers that be do not want that to happen ok brian that is a wonderful summary of everything\n                  you have been involved in over the past few years what\n                  i had like to do is actually go back in time and get something\n                  about kind of the things that triggered you to become the\n                  man you are today because clearly you have had a huge sort of arc learning\n                  curve whatever you want to call it in which you have\n                  really traversed quite a gamut of things and concepts and\n                  actually as a scientist you have moved quite a distance\n                  from being sort of a hands-on scientist i guess that is conventionally\n                  thought of as a scientist.you have actually become something of an innovative thinker and even maybe loosely a philosopher but you have never\n                  lost sight of the science so at this point you are really\n                  an interesting combination of these things and so what i had like to do is talk about your background\n                  as an astronaut you were preparing to go to mars i understand.bo\u2019l yes and yet you never went if you could tell me a little\n                  bit about what was going in your head back then when you were what\n                  do you say in the astronaut program where were you\n                  at you know psychologically so that we can kind of get the\n                  arc of the change because i think that would be fascinating\n                  for people.bo\u2019l yes kerry yes that is a good question and a complex one but i think from a very early age i always i have\n                  always been a visionary i have thought outside the box when i was a little kid i was drawing rockets and wanted to\n                  go to the moon even my high school yearbook says under my\n                  name he wants to go to the moon and people were\n                  laughing this was before sputnik wonderful.bo\u2019l everybody thought i was crazy ok.bo\u2019l then i majored in physics i did not\n                  enjoy it it was kind of dry but i realized that i had\n                  better know some of that stuff if i wanted to go to the moon and then as luck would have it of course john f kennedy\n                  in 1961 set the lunar landing goal and i got very enthused i was in graduate school at the time a few years later i got my phd at berkeley in astronomy and\n                  planetary science so i had really prepped myself to go to\n                  mars because my phd thesis was about mars and indeed i was selected to go to mars i was even asked\n                  by the selection committee in my interview would you be\n                  willing to submit to a hazardous two-year journey to mars and\n                  i said fine i do not know whether my wife would\n                  like it but i want to go i was gung ho i had a crew cut it was very different from\n                  the way things are for me now it was later i became a hippy sort of you know an alternative thinker shall we\n                  say but i think all of this was inbred in me i had always\n                  had problems with authority i always had problems with rules that is one reason why i had go from university to\n                  university i was recognized more for mediocrity and doing\n                  research on tiny little specialties i was well rewarded when\n                  that happened but when i had some visionary idea such as space colonies or mining the asteroids for their raw materials people would\n                  scratch their heads and say well this guy is not\n                  quite with it one colleague said brian do not have such an open mind that your brains will spill\n                  out and it was only later though that you see i was still in the materialistic paradigm i was\n                  still assuming that anything and everything could be explained\n                  in terms of matter and in terms of reductionism and everything made up of little atoms right the normal scientific paradigm.bo\u2019l yes so what happened to take you from the astronaut\n                  program to actually being a professor i understand you were\n                  tapped but you also sort of left the astronaut program so\n                  how did that happen?bo\u2019l well i left the astronaut program because\n                  they cancelled the mars program and i felt that and\n                  we knew that the space shuttle was coming along but the wait\n                  for that would have to be at least 15 years we also had to fly high-performance jets i calculated that\n                  i had have a one-in-five chance of being killed in a jet\n                  accident  which is both air force and astronaut statistics\n                   even before i got to see a space flight and it would just\n                  be into earth orbit in the space shuttle so i decided right\n                  then and there to quit and but there was an additional reason and that is that the reason\n                  why nasa had canceled the mars mission was because we were\n                  getting involved in vietnam so i really got pretty angry about\n                  the vietnam war for me personally as well as for the whole\n                  country the whole world and so i became a leading war protestor carl sagan called me from cornell and asked me to join the\n                  faculty i accepted the offer and spent many years at cornell\n                  in the astronomy department planetary science department and i became very creative in research then but still within\n                  the bounds of western science but in the planetary exploration\n                  program that was for a period of about a decade then after that i got more politically involved and i advised\n                  a number of presidential candidates  george mcgovern morris\n                  udall i worked for udall i was his energy advisor when he\n                  ran for president he was a very environmental congressman i advised jesse jackson on converting the huge aerospace capability\n                  we have to peaceful purposes like developing solution energy\n                  and other programs that would be of use to the public and not\n                  to just this hungry elite it was around then that i really became rebellious i went\n                  from university to university and i never was satisfied but is not there a time in which you and carl\n                  sagan sort of had a falling-out or a distancing can you describe\n                  what happened there?bo\u2019l yes well for one thing carl was very\n                  angry i left cornell when i did it was one very cold\n                  snowy day in may i landed in syracuse and there was a horizontal\n                  blizzard  in may  and i said that is it for upstate\n                  new york and carl thought that was very frivolous because of course he was kind of an empire-builder kind of guy and\n                  he also had a huge ego it was only later when i began to embrace the ufo phenomenon\n                  and the cover-up studying all these organizations that were\n                  covering up and having some direct experience myself as\n                  a researcher no longer beholden to funding from nasa or the\n                  university environment that i began to double-check some of\n                  carl\u2019s work i saw for example the famous \u201cface in cydonia\n                  on mars photographed by viking in 1975 which shows this gigantic\n                  mesa that resembles a human face about a mile across carl\n                  and i debated this it was very very disappointing to me because not only was\n                  carl wrong he also fudged data he published a picture of\n                  the \u201cface in parade magazine a popular\n                  article saying that the \u201cface was just a natural\n                  formation but he doctored the picture to make it not look\n                  like a face i began to realize just directly from the scientific point\n                  of view not only hearsay that this man was colluding with\n                  nasa that there might be more to this than before and then when i started studying things like mj12 and other organizations\n                  that were covering up the ufo phenomenon carl was on a committee with a number of notable people there\n                  was a report issued by the brookings institution in 1961 \n                  and that is about when i knew carl during those years the \u201960s mostly was when i worked closely with him \n                  that he and this other group said well if any ets ever\n                  showed up on the earth it has to be covered up that is\n                  the only way we are going to be able to manage this because\n                  if we cannot then it would be too much of a culture shock so their recommendation to the government in 1961 was to cover\n                  up the ufo phenomenon and i think in a way that provided a\n                  justification for the ongoing cover-up way back in \u201961\n                   was to keep things secret and of course they still are so at what point were you where did hoagland\n                  come into this mix because once you were talking about the \u201cface on\n                  mars i have to assume that you had some interaction with hoagland.bo\u2019l yes he actually he is a great\n                  catalyst he is very articulate he is very bright he had some very good ideas he came to me in about i\n                  think it was around 1980 it was a few years after the viking\n                  mission and i was still involved with the mainstream then so dick hoagland wanted me  still being a somewhat mainstream\n                  planetary scientist  to listen to him listen to his presentation\n                  about the cydonia \u201cface and he made a presentation\n                  which i thought was very good he asked me to check his work i thought a great deal of the\n                  work was extremely well done and which i vindicated enough\n                  to say that yes i too would like to get into this\n                  research and then the research started to snowball so\n                  that was the good news the not-so-good news is that he also made a lot of claims\n                  that were certainly not correct they were scientifically not\n                  well grounded he was arbitrary in picking some of the points\n                  in the region as control points for various geometric alignments which were simply not true so i also had somewhat of a falling-out\n                  with him because you see most scientists people trained in science as a\n                  scientist in a way i still defend mainstream science\n                  in terms of methodology that you have to have your work subject\n                  to peer review in order to get it published and i think that is\n                  very good you know it is really good to preserve the\n                  scientific method so i found myself in this odd middle ground between people\n                  that were outside the system making claims such as dick hoagland\n                  did some of which are very very substantial and good on\n                  the one hand and on the other hand using strict scientific\n                  methods to approach these questions eventually some colleagues joined me and a number of us now\n                  have worked together such as dr mark carlotto an imaging\n                  scientist professor stan mcdaniel chairman of the philosophy\n                  department at sonoma state doctor horace crater professor\n                  of physics university of tennessee the late dr tom van flandern these are all mainstream scientists trained in the mainstream\n                  just like i was and also open to the questions such as the \u201cface on\n                  mars so in a way it was kind of a roundabout way because now\n                  that i was out of the mainstream because all i have\n                  to do is stick my neck out a little to be totally ostracized\n                  by the mainstream scientific community and that happened around\n                  1980 was that when you were at princeton?bo\u2019l yes ok so what because i know there are some\n                  parallels between you and the late john mack i know you knew\n                  him and how he was treated by harvard and so can you talk\n                  a little bit about what happened to you at princeton?bo\u2019l well yes actually i think i left before\n                  they threw me out  because i saw the handwriting\n                  on the wall i was in the physics department all men nobel laureates about five or six nobel laureates and every other\n                  tuesday at the joseph henry luncheons we would swill a thimbleful\n                  of sherry and the most common topic of discussion was how\n                  ridiculous claims of the paranormal were.meanwhile i was sneaking off to workshops on the weekends i did a lifespring training i did a number of other\n                  healing seminars and so forth i started to step outside of\n                  the box and i found that they were very wrong but my colleagues\n                  were also they had more power than i did at that time so i felt the most prudent thing to do was to simply leave and that is what i did but how did their antagonism towards you manifest\n                  in that setting?bo\u2019l well for one thing when i left there were no regrets because the word got around that i was\n                  going off half-cocked here in embracing paranormal phenomena they were looking askance anyway because at that time i was\n                  working with professor gerard o\u2019neill on space colonies and even those concepts were a bit far-out for the other physicists\n                  there so it was like a double whammy and so in my case i left before they could have caused problems whereas john\n                  mack and where did you go when you say you left where\n                  were you headed did you know where you were headed or were\n                  you just leaving?bo\u2019l no i just left i just left oh fascinating because that is huge would not\n                  you say that that is your major break with academia bo\u2019l yes from then on you kind of took a trajectory that\n                  actually went like that in a sense?bo\u2019l yes yes i did in the interim i\n                  had a near-death experience in an auto accident which prompted\n                  me to go to california go west young man so i took all my worldly possessions and bought a beat-up old\n                  ford van and threw it in there and drove to california in 1982 wow.bo\u2019l this was just after a near-death experience\n                  i had in an auto accident which was yet another paranormal\n                  indicator that where i was and what i was doing was not working\n                  for me when you say you had a near-death experience you\n                  know i am not sure how you feel about that but is it\n                  possible to convey to us what connected that experience with\n                  the paranormal did you actuallymeaning did you die\n                  and see certain things?bo\u2019l my near-death experience was during an auto\n                  accident on slick ice that suddenly appeared and fortunately\n                  i was by myself i did several flips i was going 65 mph i\n                  ended up in a ditch accordion-style but my experience of the accident was not of the violence but instead a brilliant light  first of all bobbing spheres and then a brilliant light that i wanted to become at-one with i did become at-one with it then the next thing i knew i was sitting in the driver\u2019s\n                  seat dazed shocked and a man was at the window of the car he was a professional auto insurance adjustor who had witnessed\n                  the accident and he said i am amazed you are\n                  alive let alone uninjured and that to me was a profound experience because at that\n                  point i had not studied the paranormal very much i was\n                  still at princeton i was just getting my appetite whetted\n                  about some of these things about human potential and about\n                  my own experiences i had remote viewing experiences i had\n                  the near-death experience i had healing experiences and that was kind of my signpost to leave princeton and to\n                  just go on my own and that was a risky thing i ended up in\n                  california in la looking for a job in the aerospace industry\n                  so i could get my kids through college but to do civilian work i did find a position with science\n                  applications which turned out to be a you know it is\n                  one of the \u201cblack budget beltway bandit groups but i did not i was not involved\n                  in is that saic?bo\u2019l saic yes they are notorious actually for being part\n                  of the black budget.bo\u2019l yes and i had nothing to do with it i\n                  refused to do any work for the military even \u201cpeaceful work like satellites to just sense threats to defend themselves i was even offered to do that and i refused to do it after four and a half years just before i got vested in my\n                  retirement plan they laid me off and they had good reason\n                  to too i did not pull in any money so\n                  it was then  and now we are talking 1987  that i made\n                  a clean break with the mainstream ok.bo\u2019l i got my kids halfway through college and\n                  then i got on the metaphysical church circuit unity and religious\n                  science churches and that is how i kind of made a living\n                  for about a decade while i was just metaphysically exploring just going into so many modalities of alternative thinking what i discovered during that decade of the \u201980s into\n                  the \u201990s and that is what created my books was\n                  that you could use the methods of science itself to verify and to further develop metaphysical realities mm hm yes.bo\u2019l and that is what really fascinated\n                  me you can actually use the scientific method to investigate\n                  the occult as well.bo\u2019l that is right absolutely it is a great method regardless of where it is\n                  applied in some ways.bill ryan (br while you were are princeton before\n                  that did not you find a kindred spirit in robert john his is a name that many viewers of this video will probably\n                  recognize as being a pioneer and one of the trail-breaking \u201cscientific\n                  heretics in the field of paranormal exploration with\n                  the rigorous application of the scientific method i imagine\n                  that you probably got along with him pretty well.bo\u2019l yes absolutely bill i got along with\n                  him very well but the odd thing about it was that at the time\n                  when he was starting to do his experiments at the princeton\n                  engineering anomalies research laboratory paralabs he was\n                  doing a lot of the research while i was there but i did not\n                  know what he was doing he did not know what i was doing either because i did not\n                  want to share with my colleagues the fact that i was sneaking\n                  off to workshops on weekends or that i was having paranormal\n                  experiences so we were both in the closet at that point he did not\n                  know what i was doing i did not know what he was doing although we were colleagues on various mainstream projects such as developing propulsion systems to go to mars his specialty was various advanced propulsion systems for\n                  rockets he was the chairman well actually the dean of the\n                  school of engineering at princeton i would put on a number\n                  of conferences with jerry  o\u2019neill on space colonies space settlements and bob john took part in those so i knew him pretty well but not in this role of paranormal\n                  research that only happened later when i visited his laboratory\n                  and did an interview with him for one of my books the\n                  second coming of science that our whole relationship\n                  was redefined it was around then that i also developed a relationship with\n                  john mack as i was learning more and more about the ufo phenomenon\n                  and some of the more verifiable aspects of its reality so in a way i have had a ball in my life because i was\n                  able to be very independent i did not have to depend\n                  on anybody for career purposes i did not get paid very\n                  much i was you know living very simply for a period of 20\n                  or 30 years still do in a sense because you know we just do things a little differently the point is that for i would say now almost 30 years i\n                  have not had to be beholden to anybody to approve what\n                  i am doing that is incredible.bo\u2019l but on the other hand that can create problems too and it did sure.bo\u2019l when black ops tried to recruit me once\n                  and i refused there were consequences and they were very serious but without sharing exactly what they were suffice it to say\n                  that i began to realize that at that time and i am talking\n                  20 or so years ago i was pretty na\u00efve i was wanting\n                  to do all kinds of things like organize conferences get researchers\n                  together to speak in a unified way about various issues but\n                  that was not well appreciated by the powers that be i want to get into that because that is a really\n                  interesting part of your history but before we do that you\n                  did say you got to know john mack i think he was a friend\n                  of yoursbo\u2019l yes and i was curious did he ever i do not\n                  know regress you did you have what he would consider a contact\n                  experience?bo\u2019l not to my knowledge i did not have\n                  that kind of relationship with him the relationship was more\n                  like when i was really heavy into ufo research during the 1990s i was attempting to piece together the best information that\n                  was scientifically most grounded and also found out well what is the contact experience telling us this led on\n                  his part and my part to have a profound sense of colleagueship\n                  and deep concern about the fate of the earth the fate of our\n                  culture because the environmental problems are so severe and that is because the contactees were coming\n                  back with this message basically kind of almost across the\n                  board is that right?bo\u2019l that is correct his book passport\n                    to the cosmos which was his latest book before his\n                    untimely death was really an account of that the most common\n                    denominator of the contact experience was that the visitors\n                    were telling us and doing graphic emotionally-charged images\n                    of what the earth would look like if we keep doing things\n                    the way we are doing them and so john came to this issue from the point of view of\n                  abduction research i came to it from the point of view of\n                  just looking at the numbers at just how the state of the world\n                  is just miserable that we have got not that much longer\n                  before tipping points will destabilize climate and all sorts\n                  of catastrophes that is even setting aside the possibility of nuclear\n                  war of bankrupt well everything is getting bankrupt\n                  now anyway i mean it is disaster ahead unless we change\n                  our ways john kind of saw the light robert john at princeton saw the\n                  light and little by little you see as scientists we as\n                  colleagues came together but it took a long time  we have\n                  been divided and ruled would you say that in some ways you kind of became\n                  a figure or a central person around which a lot of these\n                  people could come together on the one hand the ufo researchers\n                   i know that you started setting up conferences you would\n                  bring them in but on the other hand you were actually bringing\n                  scientists to the table such as john mack and robert john.bo\u2019l that is correct i co-founded an organization\n                  called the international association for new science and we\n                  had annual conferences between about 1989 and 1999 the other\n                  co-founder god rest his soul maury  albertson who\n                  was a professor of civil engineering at colorado state he\n                  and i and one other fellow basically founded it we had conferences and we had convene people in various\n                  disciplines in what we would call \u201cnew science which would include free energy ufo research paranormal research reincarnation research we had bring in some of the best scientists in those fields\n                  and we had create a collegiality and also do a public program\n                  of lectures that would then pay for the travel of the people we kind of worked on a shoestring budget i am sure you are\n                  familiar with that one but there was a lot\n                  of ambition and motivation maury just passed over but at the ripe age of about 90 so\n                  he is one of my heroes a lot of my heroes have passed\n                  over and some of them more recently than others so it is\n                  kind of like a lonely business sometimes so it was during the time when you were putting\n                  these conferences together that you actually felt there was\n                  a hit on you from the secret government if you will is that\n                  correct i mean i am not sure how you would term it.bo\u2019l well yes let us say\n                  that i have had a situation that was threatening to me\n                  and it was as a result of some of my work and also it is\n                  happened to many of my colleagues as well so that my efforts\n                  to unify organize scientists to express freely was like\n                  a lot of other researchers was considered not so good but at that point i understand that was\n                  sort of one more brick in the wall at that point but you did not\n                  actually stop doing that stop doing the conferences because\n                  of that did you?bo\u2019l no i kept going mm hm.bo\u2019l i kept going and i have lived to tell\n                  the story and i am very grateful for that that was through the \u201990s.bo\u2019l mm hm ok and at some point you also got involved with\n                  mallove is that right?bo\u2019l that is right eugene mallove was just\n                  kind of to tell you the story briefly was the chief\n                  science writer for mit he had a doctorate in education and\n                  was a brilliant writer in 1989 stanley pons and martin fleischmann two chemists\n                  from the university of utah claimed that they had made\n                  a breakthrough called cold fusion in which when they\n                  put a palladium cathode into a solution of heavy water that strangely enough nuclear reactions would occur on the cathode\n                  to create helium and the release of thermal energy which was\n                  non-radioactive it was basically room-temperature fusion which is quite different\n                  from the traditional definition of fusion which is to simulate\n                  the hydrogen bomb and build these enormous reactors called tokomacs\n                   they cost tens of millions of dollars  and would attempt\n                  to confine a plasma of hot hydrogen so that they can fuse together\n                  to release that thermal energy for generating electricity sort of like nuclear power fission power except it is\n                  fusion and it is even more powerful and so what went on was this kind of philosophical falling-out it was this typical \u201cscientific heresy type of\n                  thing where the hot fusion physicists which pretty much controlled\n                  the department of energy at mit and caltech and places like\n                  that immediately banded together and they tried to discredit\n                  this discovery so gene mallove took an interest in this issue and he at\n                  first had the prejudice just like we all do i think on the\n                  side of caution felt that yes these guys at the\n                  university of utah are probably crazy and he would join\n                  the physicists at mit and write a story about just what bunk\n                  and poppycock this cold fusion breakthrough was what mallove found out much to his surprise was that the\n                  hot fusion scientists at mit who tried to replicate the experiment first\n                  of all they did not know the science they were not\n                  chemists they were nuclear physicists very different field but also the point is that mallove found that the mit hot fusion physicists\n                  were fudging their data to make it look like it was not\n                  there whereas as in fact the data showed it was there their\n                  discovery was vindicated so this led mallove to write an article that was like an\n                  expose on this whereupon he was fired  from mit and\n                  then he started infinite energy magazine and became\n                  a leading organizer of scientists and advocate of at\n                  first it was cold fusion then he expanded his repertoire to\n                  vacuum energy and various forms of advanced hydrogen energy and you used to write articles for his publication is that right?bo\u2019l yes see he started a magazine called infinite\n                    energy yes excellent magazine i think it will go\n                    into history as one of the seminal breakthrough publications\n                    of all time he would write scathing editorials about how the scientific\n                  community is stuck in the mud about questions like free energy and he i am sure rattled a lot of cages in his work and then of course the rest is history in 2004 some thieves\n                  broke into his house and brutally murdered him we do not\n                  know the exact cause but i think we know the motive it is\n                  just too much of a coincidence because he rattled a lot of\n                  cages his loss was a great loss for me he was one of my heroes mm hm.bo\u2019l so when you see heroes living in your time and people with whom you have a close connection and they are\n                  suddenly dead it does cause concern and it was at that point  because we are\n                  in ecuador right now  that i understand that you decided\n                  to actually leave the states.bo\u2019l well it was one of the reasons yes one\n                  of the reasons was just to \u201cretire just to you\n                  know live out our lives in peace and harmony but still do\n                  my work you know write books and give lectures and organize\n                  conferences and that i intend to continue doing but i am really very glad to be here it is so very\n                  peaceful and you know i just hope that together we can create\n                  a bright new future that has an opportunity to move ahead i think that is one of my bottom-line messages now is\n                  that people need to become more aware because logic alone common sense alone says we should leave no stone unturned\n                  in seeking clean energy sources for our future we should leave no stone unturned in our investigation of\n                  the et phenomenon because there is a lot we can learn\n                  from this there is a lot we can do in the future to redirect us\n                  instead of having this to be the sole territory of black budgets\n                  and people who want to cover up things  but the general public\n                  is not aware of this mm hm.bo\u2019l they are not aware that free energy or solution energy could be the holy grail of our time and\n                  that is where the camelot theme comes in sure.bo\u2019l it is the search for the holy grail well the holy grail has been found it is just that most people do not realize that ok well so you seem to be like such an enigma in a sense because you were trained in the astronaut program and then you went through academia and you had to be highly\n                  rewarded during that time yet you still thought outside the\n                  box and you still made all these adventurous changes in your\n                  life and then here you are in ecuador even that takes a\n                  great deal of courage to leave everything you know and start\n                  a new life and this has got to be like a slap in the face of the military industrial complex that here you are you have become\n                  this incredible rebel and yet you have all these degrees and so on i know there was an issue where they tried to actually bury\n                  your background as an ex-astronaut which is unbelievable i know that there actually has been some attempt to change\n                  the definition of what an ex-astronaut or an astronaut\n                  candidate is so that they could actually wipe your record\n                  clean i think you have had more than one experience in this\n                  way and there are certainly many people out there that have\n                  had similar things happen to them especially when they are\n                  rebels free thinkers people that are going outside the box\n                  of the old paradigm so if you could talk a little bit about\n                  what happened to you?bo\u2019l yes kerry well i was appointed to the\n                  astronaut program in 1967 and my title then was astronaut i even have hanging on the wall here i do not\n                  have the accurate date but i had say roughly around 1990\n                  it came to my attention well i will backtrack a little bit a reporter from the san\n                    diego union tribune interviewed me after i gave a talk\n                    in san diego part of my credentials said \u201cex-astronaut and one of the people on the board of the san diego union\n                    tribune was wally schirra one of the original seven\n                    mercury astronauts who unbeknownst to me formed what was\n                    called the society for space explorers in which the term astronaut was\n                    redefined to \u201canybody that went 50 miles above the\n                    earth\u2019s surface so in a way i was defrocked when schirra hit the ceiling and apparently the reporter lost his position just\n                  like the first reporter that covered the first wright brothers flight\n                  was fired from his position by his editor for not believing\n                  that heavier-than-air flight was possible so this is just once again a reporter was fired for using the \u201cwrong credential well i found that out and then shortly after that an organization with which i\n                  worked some mufon the mutual ufo network in the us also\n                  it came to their attention that maybe in fact i was not an\n                  astronaut so they wrote to nasa and nasa said well\n                  in fact he was not they said you were not.bo\u2019l i was not they actually wrote to nasa bo\u2019l well i think so i am not absolutely\n                  sure of the details but i can tell you who would know is bob\n                  bletchman who was the lawyer for mufon at the time uh huh.bo\u2019l anyway bob bletchman wrote me and it was\n                  kind of a challenging letter that basically said many\n                  of us feel that you misrepresented your credentials so\n                  i presented my credentials to bob bletchman and he became convinced\n                  that indeed that was my title at the time and that indeed\n                  it was appropriate to use that in my credentials incredible.bo\u2019l not that i used it all the time because actually i would not because i was trying to get away\n                  from that controversy and you know there is much more\n                  about me besides being an ex-astronaut that is kind of\n                  interesting anyway so it did not matter to me too much one way or the other but i got vindicated because mufon challenged me in public\n                  and then later vindicated me that indeed i was an astronaut so that was cleared up.now on another occasion for a year i had a visiting faculty\n                  appointment at caltech during the mariner 10 mission in which\n                  i was deputy team leader of the television imaging science\n                  team for mariner 10 that went by venus and mercury during the\n                  1970s professor bruce murray who later became the director of jpl appointed me deputy team leader during that time i was at\n                  caltech and worked on the mission with him and some of the\n                  other scientists so fast-forward to the year 2000 and a very bright senior\n                  honors physics student who knew that i was researching solution\n                  energies such as cold fusion and so forth said gee you\n                  ought to come to caltech would you like to speak at our commencement\n                  as a speaker for alternative future science such as cold fusion and\n                  i said i would be happy to so they scheduled it they started posting things and advertising\n                  the event then this one professor that i had worked for who\n                  later became director of jpl apparently actively tried to\n                  suppress the entire gig and then it turned out that there was no record that i was\n                  even at caltech denied that i was deputy team leader denied that i was even at caltech but it was\n                  so simple because i had published papers well in science and\n                  other journals and caltech was the affiliation that was under\n                  my name and not only that you had to have colleagues who\n                  remember you you know who are still there even i am\n                  sure.bo\u2019l exactly yes absolutely so it is an amazing thing.bo\u2019l amazing thing they tried to erase it and\n                  i thought gee maybe i could find some paycheck stubs\n                  or something like that because apparently i was wiped\n                  off the caltech records that i was even there  even in their\n                  administration  because i tried to follow that one up so if somebody was doing an article on you and wanted\n                  to investigate and called caltech today they will say that\n                  you never worked there.bo\u2019l exactly amazing.bo\u2019l yes it just shows you how the machine works and i think\n                  that this is very instructive to many people who challenge\n                  a lot of whistleblowers on the fact that their credentials\n                  have disappeared you know?bo\u2019l yes yes so this is very instructive here you are working\n                  in free energy you are an ex-astronaut i know there is\n                  a video on google in which you are actually speaking before\n                  the white house during the bush administration not so long\n                  ago and you know very fiery very impressive very courageous basically saying that bush should not be in office and talking\n                  to some degree about the cover-up that is tremendously courageous and yet i did not\n                  know anything about it until we started to investigate coming\n                  to see you and all can you talk a little bit about that and then i know that you also did the same thing back in the\n                  nixon administration but the number of people around you was\n                  strikingly reduced and i want to do that because i want to\n                  talk about how times are changing.bo\u2019l yes and what may be coming down the line.bo\u2019l yes it is very sad for me to see\n                  this develop and yes you are right kerry that in 1970 i was an\n                  anti-vietnam war protestor and along with other people from\n                  cornell and many places there were about 100,000 of us when\n                  cambodia was invaded we marched on washington towards the\n                  white house a number of us that were leaders of this protest\n                  locked arms and tried to walk between a line of buses that\n                  was blocking the white house from us we were fully expecting to be handcuffed and arrested  which\n                  was fine you know it was an act of civil disobedience instead we were invited into the white house to express our outrage\n                  with some of nixon\u2019s advisors and then just after that some of us i think the interview\n                  with me was the lead story on cbs evening news it\n                  would have been and you can probably look it up i think it\n                  was april 30 1970 and there was also a certain number of people that\n                  attended that.bo\u2019l 100,000 which is amazing.bo\u2019l and by contrast i joined a protest march\n                  onto the white house in 2007 no 2006 it was the fifth\n                  anniversary of 9/11 and there were a few it was a motley crew\n                  of about 30 of us it was a beautiful day it was september 11 2006 and we marched\n                  to the white house some of my 9/11 truther friends and i gave\n                  little speeches in front of the white house and what i felt there was that washington had changed that\n                  it was no longer a place where there had be any democratic\n                  discourse instead it was a locked shop it was like people\n                  were robotically walking around business as usual to me 9/11 truth is sort of like a metaphor for what is\n                  going on now there are other truths too of course like\n                  solution energy truth truths that are being covered up but\n                  it is being covered up also by people who are otherwise\n                  intelligent and free-thinking and progressive those people\n                  are not there either they are buying into the system the system itself has become kind of locked up and this is\n                  so sad to me the reason why i guess i have what you might\n                  call some degree of courage other people might call it naivety\n                  or foolishness is that i sometimes think it is either\n                  the earth or me or anybody else that wants to try to\n                  make a difference and bring in the new paradigm because i happen to think we can have a new paradigm but we need to stand and be counted we need to go to the white\n                  house bang pots i mean we had a change in the presidency of ecuador a very\n                  positive change as a result of about a million people getting\n                  out there in front of the presidential palace and banging pots\n                  until the president left that is non-violent it is\n                  a method of changing and what is happening now in the us is very scary because\n                  the people in charge that are obviously pulling the strings\n                  of the politicians bribing them and it is so\n                  obvious especially seen from here to see the decline of the\n                  culture in just about every respect whether it is economic ecological peace vs war it is locked up it is\n                  a closed shop there are a few courageous people around that i know friends\n                  like dennis kucinich and you know some of the others cynthia\n                  mckinney i have done some work with ralph nader although\n                  i could not convince him that solution energy was possible there are a lot of people that do stand on the good side of\n                  the force but they are very few and far between now mm hm.bo\u2019l and i want to be joined by people i need\n                  support i need to team up with more and more people who feel\n                  as i do and are willing to stand and be counted well can you talk just name a few names\n                  if you do not mind of the people that are actually in\n                  more or less the alternative world but they are not willing\n                  to actually embrace the ideas of free energy even ufos you\n                  know the idea that there might be black projects out there i mean because we had talked briefly and i know that you\n                  talked about some of these people are actually good\n                  friends of yours.bo\u2019l yes there are many people in the progressive\n                  community i would say kucinich himself is in this category he is been on the fence i was able to script for him\n                  an interview he had with npr when he was running for president\n                  in 2004 i was advising him on solution energy and trying to\n                  come up with the right words so that he could become all-inclusive\n                  about you know leaving no stone unturned in our quest for\n                  new energy sources and so kucinich did a little of that but then he kind of\n                  retrenched some there were a number of glitches that came\n                  up but he wanted to create some legislation that would provide\n                  funding for new energy research and development which is what\n                  we really need we need an apollo program for this we need\n                  to bring people under one roof to research it right.bo\u2019l or to somehow in other ways support the\n                  work well which is not happening now of course but\n                  there are other people but there are other thinkers that are very movers\n                  and shakers in many ways criticizing the current paradigm they are very courageous in that way and yet they will not they actually will not go outside the box to a certain\n                  degree.bo\u2019l exactly they are what wade frazier a good friend and i call structuralists these are\n                  people like noam chomsky naomi klein and they are also\n                  the kind of people that will not look at 9/11 truth so\n                  there is a pattern here there is a pattern of various things that become what\n                  david ray griffin calls sacred myths one sacred myth\n                  is the official story of 9/11 it is true and it is\n                  obviously true and there is no disputing it another sacred myth is that there is no such thing as\n                  a free lunch when it comes to energy so you have all of these\n                  environmentalists that are just nay-saying even the possibility of\n                  free energy and this would be a number of notable people people on the cutting edge of environmental policy i have\n                  broached this to many famous well-known people i will\n                  list a few please do.bo\u2019l ok amory lovens lester brown formerly\n                  of the worldwatch institute amory just walked away from me\n                  when i broached it and i have known him for years are they afraid you know can you actually sort\n                  of drill down a little and tell us do you think that it is are\n                  they afraid or is it something else is it the matrix that\n                  they have actually bought into the matrix and that was\n                  it they could not get beyond that they are certainly\n                  critics of the society but they do not you knowbo\u2019l yes that is an excellent question kerry and i cannot second-guess their negative reaction\n                  because i am not in their skin but it might be a blend\n                  of the two i know that it was politically correct and sort of de\n                    rigueur when i was in the mainstream of science to nay-say\n                    and deny anything that fell outside the box and then i was\n                    accepted so some of it is cultural for sure somebody like amory lovens or noam chomsky or naomi klein and there are many other names too i can probably pop for\n                  several more whose bias or let us say critique of\n                  the culture is narrowly confined to certain areas now on\n                  the other hand i have to grant them that maybe they just did not\n                  have time to look at these other things ok bo\u2019l like the energy or 9/11 truth but\n                  on the other hand maybe they are in the matrix maybe fear\n                  has so captivated them that they are in the box well do not you have a story about \u201cthe\n                  carrot and the stick i think that this would be a great\n                  opportunity to talk about it because it may not be just fear\n                  but also the reward system that they get through \u201dnormal\n                  society if you will bo\u2019l well yes and i think that many people and\n                  i have broken free of it but it took me a long time and\n                  it took a lot of truth-seeking but yes a lot of people yes yes they basically\n                  realize that their careers could be ruined by this i do not\n                  think most of them get to the point where there are threats but yes some people are offered very lucrative opportunities\n                  to \u201cjoin the team by the powers that be to come\n                  over to their side and when that does not happen then\n                  often they are whacked by the stick john perkins talks about this in his books the first one\n                  of which is the confessions of an economic hit man that carrots are dangled like it could come in the form of\n                  a world bank loan or it could come in the form to buy you\n                  out not to do the free energy invention or it could be being\n                  recruited to be part of their team and becoming privy to some\n                  information that you otherwise could not get well certainly funding for experimentation  from\n                  the point of view of a scientist that is always the most\n                  seductive thing one would assume.bo\u2019l that is right and a lot of free energy\n                  inventors now for example the patent office has a policy to nay-say\n                  anything that smacks of free energy or the department of defense\n                  has the secrecy law which says that if this device has any\n                  defense application   offense application\n                   then you are going to have your device confiscated and\n                  you can never work on it again well along those lines let us actually move\n                  along to free energy and i know you have done a tremendous\n                  amount of investigation here but you have also investigated\n                  the cover-up of free energy and the people that have maybe\n                  gotten to a certain point and then been i do not know hit in one way or another the device stolen do you have some anecdotes along those lines and some people\n                  that you can talk about who have done investigations i\n                  know you traveled the world doing some in one of your\n                  books talking about that.bo\u2019l well yes i mean first of all there are\n                  many inventors who have been assassinated threatened had\n                  their funding removed and i can go through the list obviously\n                  you will be able to post the list and their stories ok.bo\u2019l and i have been able to authenticate\n                  many of these stories myself personally and they are\n                  pretty much right-on but they are people like tom bearden there is a\n                  man called gary vesperman who is accumulated many many\n                  suppression stories of all kinds for free energy there is wade frazier and his excellent website www.ahealedplanet.net in\n                  which he explores in many hundreds of pages many suppression\n                  stories and some of his own experience with the inventor and\n                  promoter dennis lee and there are just so many others you know that is one of the things i have said in\n                  my \u201ccarrot and the stick story is that there\n                  are a thousand ways to suppress an inventor or researcher and there are also a thousand ways to eliminate them or threaten\n                  them and there are it is also we are also vulnerable to forces because\n                  we have these bodies and these bodies are very vulnerable to\n                  any kind of attack or threat and those of our loved ones mm hm.bo\u2019l so in a sense the powers that be hold all\n                  the cards right now and most people are afraid to even venture\n                  into this territory and that in part is also a psychological phenomenon there is\n                  been some really good research done on this that the pain\n                  center of the brain is hit as soon as you start to talk about\n                  anything that smacks of conspiracy theory (which of course is the dismissal that is really truth-seeking that\n                  anything any painful new truth is going to reach the pain\n                  center of the brain first whereas if you join the lynch mob if you join the\n                  powers that be then everything is pretty comfortable the\n                  pleasure center you can have fun with life mm hm.bo\u2019l so in a way it is \u201cme or\n                    the earth that is the way it seems\n                    to be and this dark agenda which is not really so hidden\n                    now if people only take the time out and look at that but also look at the great promise and potential of solution\n                  energy it is really a one-two punch in education that is\n                  necessary but at the same time i have many wonderful dear friends progressive people otherwise progressive who still cannot\n                  get their heads around the free energy question because they\n                  say well you know if you show it to me then i will\n                  believe it but until then it is not worth looking at\n                  as a question well george green is a friend of yours and he is\n                  been working with john bedini and you know george is one\n                  of those people who is certainly on the side of free energy\n                  and is certainly aware of it have you seen a device or have\n                  you seen john bedini\u2019s work and what might you think\n                  of that and so on.bo\u2019l oh yes i visited many laboratories and\n                  visited a lot of people and i took photographs of them but\n                  i have also investigated in great detail the concepts like for example this man\n                  is sparky sweet or floyd sweet i visited him in the \u201990s he is passed over now and this is a specially conditioned\n                  magnet that he was showing it produces free energy his laboratory was in an undisclosed location in the mojave\n                  desert he had before been in la and was broken\n                  into his laboratory was broken into he was threatened they\n                  were spying on him with infrared cameras you know all of\n                  this was well documented this is bruce depalma who invented the n-machine while he\n                  was at mit and he was so suppressed by the securities and\n                  exchange commission when he tried to start his own company he immigrated to australia they did not like it there either so he immigrated to new zealand and died young of a\n                  heart attack about a decade ago this is some of bruce\u2019s apparatus it is an n-machine it is basically a magnetic motor magnets that go up on\n                  a wheel that are spun up and then they interact with a hypothesized\n                  zero-point vacuum energy field and you get free energy you\n                  get over-unity power this is paramahamsa tewari in india who had demonstrated a\n                  version of the n-machine which is magnets on a motor on a\n                  wheel now tewari is a very prestigious physicist he works\n                  for the government of india he was chief project engineer of their largest nuclear power\n                  plant but they also the government of india gave him\n                  laboratory space and funding to develop this machine which\n                  he demonstrated to me and which was lighting light bulbs with\n                  the machine being unplugged it was just free-running for 20 30 minutes and the basic principles were very very well presented\n                  to me photographed it is there for everybody to see.this is shiuji inomata he also passed over at a relatively\n                  young age he worked for the tsukuba space center in japan also a ph.d physicist and president of the japan psychotronics\n                  institute and he had also one of these magnetic motors which\n                  was spinning up and producing excess energy and again he\n                  died young most of all these people die young.this is john hutchison from canada right well we have had interactions with john\n                  and actually we had love to interview him at some point can you tell us you know your take on hisbo\u2019l yes john has personal psychic powers but\n                  he is also brilliant with machines so this is\n                  john and he actually was taking meredith\u2019s camelot sword and then he took this bar of what he would call al-u-min-ium which\n                  was thoroughly trashed by one of his tesla coils and of course\n                  the us department of defense immediately took an interest in\n                  this for reasons other than john john is a loving gentle soul and he basically has demonstrated\n                  many times over how he can produce free energy just from specially\n                  conditioned magnets yes.bo\u2019l he had be a good one to interview he is\n                  a wonderful guy and he is also done many experiments levitating\n                  objects and producing free energy yes some of his videos are on google.bo\u2019l yes we have seen some of them.bo\u2019l this is yull brown who was doing a demonstration\n                  of \u201cbrown\u2019s gas for me which was again anomalous amounts of energy just brilliant light in his welding\n                  system and tom bearden moray king these are leading\n                  theorists so these are people that i visited over the course\n                  of about ten years and have reported on this was a meeting of free energy researchers that was convened\n                  by a software billionaire in estes park colorado in 1993\n                  and \u201994 and there are a lot of and the software billionaire was could we name\n                  him?bo\u2019l well i think i had rather not because ok.bo\u2019l my comments were not always positive\n                  but he convened these people with the intention of trying to\n                  find out the best and brightest researchers and the best concepts\n                  to fund ok.bo\u2019l and then he suddenly did a reversal and\n                  said no i am not going to fund any of this because\n                  my marketing people told me that we were not dipping into the\n                  river of optimized profits in other words when you are in the toe of the profit\n                  curve we are still at the research phase of the\n                  research-and-development cycle so that is what the government is supposed to be doing the department of energy is supposed to be funding these things and my god they are hardly even funding solar and wind they are totally steeped in nuclear weapons nuclear power and fossil fuel power but in this picture there are some people really sad cases this was stefan marinov who was europe\u2019s leading free\n                  energy inventor and researcher he was a professor of physics\n                  at the university of graz in austria jolly fellow wonderful\n                  man just positive and upbeat and a few years ago a few years\n                  after this conference he was seen jumping off the 10th story\n                  of the library building to his death incredible.bo\u2019l some people saw him going backwards it\n                  looked like he was pushed off and again it is just another\n                  one of these cases there are many other people in this picture who are no longer\n                  alive but these are the leading free energy researchers from\n                  all over the word and jim carrey who was filming dumb\n                  and dumber while we were trying to get smart and\n                  smarter yes interesting so ok let us\n                  go from here to what kind of solutions you are advocating or where you think we can go for the future just to sort of\n                  inspire all the people that are listening to this because\n                  truly you are a very inspiring man and you know your courage your willingness to think outside of the box and then in the\n                  face of all odds to persist on this road i mean you just\n                  released this new book right?bo\u2019l right the energy solution revolution exactly so what is it that your book is about what are you advocating and how can you encourage or give\n                  us an encouraging word about the future if you have one bo\u2019l well i think the bottom line of this this\n                  is the book and i have been working on it for about 6 years it is kind of different essays but they all come together\n                  because they first talk about well just looking at the table\n                  of contents that it is being covered up at every turn mm hm.bo\u2019l there is hardly anybody alive that is\n                  not covering it up either by commission or omission.orwell one time said the greatest lies are lies of omission and so a lot of people who are otherwise progressive and enlightened\n                  and very bright just suppress it and so this book is a study of the breakthroughs and the suppression also the ecological mandate the fact that the problems with\n                  the earth are far greater than you would be led to believe\n                  in the media then i talk about well what is this tyranny and how\n                    can we overcome it well we can certainly overcome\n                    it by education and by revamping our political systems right now i think people are beginning to wake up to the fact\n                  that even obama does not really represent change he is\n                  great rhetorically but all these people and i would include in there a lot of\n                  people that are otherwise progressive that we have already\n                  talked about plus many others leaders of the environmental\n                  movement for example  that the cover-up is fairly complete and in a sense it is very similar to the ufo/et phenomenon to 9/11 anything else where conventional wisdom denies it.and so i kind of pick this apart i try to ask well who is doing the denying scientists are doing\n                    it they are the guardians at the gate people who call themselves scientists are the number one suppressors and so they are in unwitting alliance with the black ops\n                  people because you know if the scientists will not give\n                  it the possibility the yes-nod then it probably will not\n                  get anywhere it is sort of like galileo\u2019s\n                  colleagues refused to look through his telescope.then you have the environmentalists and i have talked\n                  with many leading environmentalists here\u2019s another example hazel henderson a leading progressive\n                  economist does not want free energy because she does not\n                  want millions of helicopters in the sky and bigger power saws and i do not blame her so that then forces the question well this has to be\n                    managed we do not want dick cheney running this\n                    one again bo\u2019l so the environmentalists are suppressing\n                  it i do not know of a mainstream environmentalist that is\n                  even willing to give it a moment of thought.al gore there is another example of somebody who i have\n                  written letters to him he does not answer so my battle\n                  is very lonely and then what else?well there is the corporations the ceo of general electric\n                  wrote this editorial for the washington post saying\n                  that we need the courage to change to new energy solutions and then he mentions the conditions under which this has to\n                  happen one is the creative mind he thinks yes we have that and\n                  then the second one was it must turn over a profit and\n                  then the third one was the american will and he sees the third\n                  ingredient lacking i see the second ingredient as interfering because\n                  general electric\u2019s profits and their shareholders\n                  depend on their making nuclear power plants and gas turbine\n                  plants if you were to have a free energy gizmo that could fit in\n                  the palm of your hand just like your dictaphone there that\n                  could produce 10 kilowatts of power which i fully believe\n                  can happen some day general electric is not going to want to\n                  develop it because it would take away from their business with\n                  gas turbine plants and nuclear power plants so the condition to turn over a profit i kind of\n                  argue well how much profit is enough clearly general\n                  electric is not at all interested in this and you know the\n                  multi-national corporations and the government have been suppressing\n                  these things anyway that is obvious so this book is all about documenting the efforts not only\n                  to break through but to suppress it and even in light of what\n                  so many people say when is there a day when you do not pick up a newspaper\n                  or hear some sort of thing on the media that al gore says\n                  we need to do something about this soon we\n                  need to develop alternate energy and then when it comes\n                  to the question of \u201cwhat the question is evaded right.bo\u2019l or at the very least it is lip service\n                  given to solar and wind which is very capital-intensive materials-intensive it is not truly renewable it is intermittent it is\n                  diffuse is not obama also talking about you know going back into coal?bo\u2019l yes i mean we are actually going backwards now\n                  the black ops of course we document here in camelot are thousands\n                  of years ahead and they have got free energy and they are\n                  using it as we speak now i think that you told us you wrote\n                  to obama is this correct?bo\u2019l yes recently and it is\n                  on my website brianoleary.com it is right there on the home page it is an open\n                  appeal to obama to really represent the change we need and\n                  not just in rhetorical means for that you are going to have to bite the hand that fed\n                  you you are going to have to go against these very wealthy\n                  elite people that are holding the puppet strings including\n                  his strings and we have to become educated about what the possibilities\n                  are and what is happened is as you say he is gone\n                  backwards he is talking about \u201cclean coal there is no such thing that is an\n                  oxymoron or about advanced nuclear or sequestration at coal\n                  power plants which is not even feasible and it is a gross\n                  technology so he is just far behind in the curve and\n                  so i am just making an appeal to him to say that you\n                  know please for heaven\u2019s sake our planet is being\n                  destroyed will you please serve the public interest because\n                  the public interest is not being served with what is happening and even solar and wind i hate to say are half-measures\n                  because the capital cost of a solar or wind economy is on the\n                  order of 20 to 40 trillions dollars we do not have that\n                  kind of money free energy is basically free once we are able\n                  to develop the hardware to the point where it becomes available and then of course all hell will break loose.but you know the suppression effort there is\n                  two great quotes here let me see if i can find \u2019em this is one in a time of universal deceit telling the\n                    truth becomes a revolutionary act george orwell yes.bo\u2019l and that is what is going on right\n                  now we are being deceived big time.here\u2019s another one when stupidity is considered\n                    patriotism it is unsafe to be intelligent isaac\n                    asimov yes and there you go that is dumb and\n                    dumber and the big rush to have movies emphasizing how\n                    funny how lovely it is to be stupid so ok this has been really amazing brian and i\n                  have to say that if ex-astronaut brian o\u2019leary was writing\n                  to me and i was the president certainly it almost seems like\n                  to you need to write back or to al gore right and is not\n                  it surprising that with your stature that these men would\n                  actually ignore you there is something to be said there as well.bo\u2019l well yes there is something to be said\n                  there and it suggests to me that they are part of the\n                  overall dark agenda right.bo\u2019l and it is just their wrinkle on it\n                  is a little different it is a little more benign-sounding mm hm.bo\u2019l one could just even be so risqu\u00e9 as\n                  to say that they advocate genocide by other means i am\n                  not really sure what is going on in their minds all i\n                  know is that their lack of answers and the lack of answers\n                  from the people they surround themselves with and people that\n                  espouse the conventional wisdom i mean even james lovelock in england he thinks outside the\n                  box but he is unbudgable amory lovens that is\n                  another one who thinks outside the box but not enough now what is\n                  happening now these are also the kinds of people that show up at the\n                  so-called green salons in washington dc it is like the\n                  whole beltway of washington is a fortress and that it is\n                  almost a sign of prestige to interact with some of the folks\n                  at the dod and cia because it might be your passport to something and meanwhile outside the box there are all these wonderful\n                  concepts waiting in the wings right.bo\u2019l that could really create a sustainable\n                  future for humankind and these people do not listen i mean i have had some access to al gore through intermediaries\n                  that know him and they will not budge you know i could\n                  name names there too it is just that the conventional wisdom pervades the\n                  entire progressive community it is like a big disease\n                  that is affected everybody and then most people are simply\n                  apathetic or they do not know wade frazier says you have to peel the onion of free\n                    energy and what that means is a combination of a certain\n                    degree of open-mindedness intelligence sentience spiritual\n                    development and on and on right in other words it is such a powerful\n                  theoretical technology or reality for those that are using\n                  it its possibilities are so grand that you actually have\n                  to be on a certain level spiritually to deal with that as\n                  a planet and i think that that is also where we are\n                  going and where we are going to have to come to terms.bo\u2019l absolutely because as long as war and weapons is our god so\n                  to speak on this planet free energy is just not appropriate\n                  to be used by those people.bo\u2019l you are totally right you are\n                  totally right kerry so we need a totally different set of leaders a\n                  different set of thinking right?bo\u2019l absolutely and in many ways you are right on the avant\n                    garde of that effort and i do believe you have many\n                    people behind you.bo\u2019l well that is good kerry and they are\n                  now kind of divided and ruled and of course part of your effort\n                  and your search for the holy grail which this is a part of a significant part of could create more strength in numbers\n                  of people willing to stand and be counted for proposing these\n                  alternatives because i too would be actually opposed to the development\n                  of free energy if the powers that be continue to be in power because they would abuse it right.bo\u2019l they would misuse it they would just\n                  like in the et phenomenon back-engineering and so forth they had\n                  keep it in the black  and use it for their own purposes so the people of the earth need to know about this more there are some hopeful signs here one of them is the country\n                  of ecuador whose president is a great deal more enlightened\n                  than prior presidents and whose government just passed a new\n                  constitution which provides for the rights of nature  and\n                  whose president has offered that if the world community were\n                  to attract matching funding that oil under the ground in a\n                  very pristine bio-diverse national park would stay in the ground if the funds could be raised enough and so you see the whole thing is systemic the whole world\n                  system is decadent and disgustingly i just you\n                  name the negative word evil i guess is the right\n                  word for it more and more people are realizing that but maybe what they\n                  do not realize is that we can make a difference we can create another agenda together i do not talk much about alternative agenda to the black\n                  ops or illuminati agenda but believe me it is a lot\n                  more pleasant i do not even want to prejudice the question well what is that agenda well i can see a world that is\n                    truly sustainable a world in which our knowledge expands\n                    to embrace the et phenomenon a world where magic what we\n                    consider as magic can now really happen a world where combined\n                    positive intention can heal ourselves and the environment absolutely.bo\u2019l and where consciousness which is really\n                  the science of the 21st century can burst forward in very\n                  dramatic counterpoint to what now is happening ok well thank you brian that is wonderful and more power to you it is been really educational for\n                  bill and i to be here we want to thank you for being our host\n                  and meredith a lovely hostess and for opening your home to\n                  us we just completed a conference here that you organized and\n                  it was very inspiring i think a lot of people really enjoyed\n                  it we hope to do more of them and certainly again here\n                  you are on the avant garde of actually getting the\n                  word out not only about free energy but about you know what is\n                  been going on the cover-up and the potential for the future\n                  that is there for all of us if we just take hold.bo\u2019l yes we are starting here kerry an\n                  alternative educational and conference center it is called montesuenos it is in the andes of ecuador my wife meredith and\n                  i have been spending the last five years creating it and now\n                  blessed by your presence and the conference that we just had we expect to have many more and we invite kindred spirits and whistleblowers absolutely the more truth-tellers the better.bo\u2019l yes and that is such an important\n                  thing your work is very important somebody had to do the\n                  work steve greer has done a piece of it and is doing a piece\n                  of it and together we can then enlighten ourselves and the\n                  public about first of all the nasty truth and then the potential\n                  truth of what could be in a better world and then\n                  together create that world there is no reason why we\n                  cannot do that absolutely thank you very much brian yes i\n                  think we covered it all.bo\u2019l one thing though i have never been\n                  in black ops and i have never been privy to it even as\n                  an astronaut yes.bo\u2019l so it is funny because i know most\n                  of the people you interview have been there and that is\n                  a whole different order of things right.bo\u2019l i kind of come on naively right but you skirted it you have been affected\n                  by them they see you as a threat and in some ways that is\n                  just as good from camelot\u2019s point of view you know you definitely qualify if you will for better\n                  or for worse i think that the wonderful thing about your life is that you have\n                  actually lived through all these experiences as an astronaut right so as a person of respect that garners respect and\n                  a person who people could rally around at the same time you are\n                  willing to have such an open mind and consider everything and that is such a rare thing to get in a person of respect\n                  nowadays i am sorry to say.bo\u2019l yes and in my case i guess i just had\n                  to check it out as i went along and my gestation of many of\n                  these things took a long time so now i am hoping for\n                  others in the lay public and just people curious people the kind of people that came to the conference were just fine people\n                  that want to get educated more about these things and who\n                  may not we may not have as much luxury of time\n                  as i had when i was going through my process of decompression\n                  from the mainstream it is been 30 years so far and that\n                  process continues to this very moment i guess we could say that you are in green\n                  ops.bo\u2019l green ops yes that is great green ops you know we ought to have an earth corps we ought\n                  to have a \u201cnew deal obama could lead that\n                  would get people out to clean up the earth and have solution\n                  energy research and development and consciousness research\n                  and make it ok to do those things why not yes absolutely why not?bo\u2019l yes but it has to have public support you cannot do it without the public history has shown\n                  that throughout well that is what doing this video is going to\n                  do that is the whole point of doing things like this i mean your book coming out and hopefully the video coming\n                  out very shortly it is the kind of thing that is\n                  going to start the movement and gather the people and that is\n                  what you need we are going to have the power of numbers that is what we want.bo\u2019l yes and i believe we are going to have it and it is\n                  already out there.bo\u2019l right it is already out there it is a matter of focusing bo\u2019l and also then the personal it is\n                  both it is the earth and then some of us in pioneering\n                  work personally we are safer because then our work outlives\n                  us and there is no reason to and safety in numbers right?bo\u2019l safety in numbers yes i think so i am\n                  optimistic that this can happen that we really do have a positive\n                  future and that is why i am on this planet that is\n                  why i am alive is to express that vision click\n                  here for\n                  the\n                  original\n                  video \u00a0\n\n\nintroduction bill\nryan (br some people have written to us and they have said look you are not going to have a policeman with a gun knocking on\nyour door accompanied by a doctor with a syringe they have not\ngot the resources to do that how actually could they enforce it if they wanted to how could it\nhappen what would be the sanctions which they have jane\nb\u00e3\u009crgermeister (jb well the french government released or\ncirculated to the heads of departments an internal document of 19\npages which outlined quite clearly their method and this is what i\nassume is happening in every country they are going to set up\nvaccine centers that are outside hospitals and gps [general\npractitioner some of these are going to be secure people\nare going to be told to go there first of their own free will and\nthen they are going to receive calls whatever telling them to\nappear at a certain time those people who do not come are going to\neventually be collected and forced to go there do the resources exist to actually do that because you are\ntalking about transporting and enforcing and rounding up and\nmaking contact with hundreds of thousands of people and possibly many\nmore than that absolutely if so many people refuse it will be impossible but\nthey are assuming that the vast majority of people will either go of\ntheir free will or when they get the call from say a police\nauthority telling them to appear or a notification they will go\nreluctantly but they will still obey that call the\nnumber of people who will actually refuse to go and stay at home\nwhen they are informed it is a criminal offense not to go will be very small and it will be a criminal offense not to go however if it turns out that hundreds of thousands and millions refuse to go then they cannot carry it through that is why it is\nimportant for every single person to say \u201cno and not to\ngo along with it start of interview bill\nryan (br this is bill ryan from project camelot i am here in\nvienna on the 8th of september 2009 i happen to be in vienna\nbecause i just returned from a conference in poland i\nhave just met jane b\u00e3\u00bcrgermeister who up until now has been a figure\nshrouded in mystery it is my great pleasure to\nintroduce you visually to the world here by being the first person in\nthe internet community to have made a trail to find out \u2013 and\nhere i am going to make a joke \u2013 \u201cwhether you really\nexist or not i can demonstrate to everyone that you truly do what may i ask jane was your response when you realized that you had an\nopportunity basically to give a message to the world on camera which is what i want to support you in being able to do jane\nburgermeister (jb well thank you bill for taking the trouble to\ncome all the way here it is a bit off the beaten track here in\nvienna it is however a significant place as it turns out it is\nthe place where baxter contaminated\n72 kilos of vaccine\nmaterial with the live bird flu and so nearly triggered a global\npandemic just a few months ago in february this\nattempt to trigger a pandemic failed because of the alertness of\npeople in the czech republic who detected it in a laboratory\nbio-test however it has\nnow turned out that baxter still has at least a large amount of that\n72 kilos of bird flu we are\ncoming to a point where we have only perhaps a few weeks until the\ngovernment here in austria and other governments around the world intend to start injecting people with the so-called swine flu vaccine\nmaterial which we have every reason to fear is going to be a big\nhazard to our health \u2013 and has been designed to be a hazard to\nour health \u2013 even if it is not contaminated with the live\nbird flu virus as it might well be so my message that i want to give to people if i can give any message is that time is running short that we all of us now have to\nrecognize the scale of the threat and danger to us individually and\ncollectively and we need to take steps and organize to stop this\nmass vaccination program as soon as possible as we were discussing when we were just chatting before we started\nthis video interview you feel a tremendous sense of urgency do not\nyou this is driving you right now well unfortunately we have seen how in spite of mounting and\ngrowing protests in the usa and now in europe the latest polls show\nthat 29 percent of the germans are categorically going to refuse the\nswine flu vaccine in\nspite of all that the governments are pressing ahead relentlessly who is pushing with tremendous determination this unwanted unnecessary and dangerous program on us and it is coming in just\na few weeks what is interesting to me is that we like you get reports\nfrom all over the world and it seems that governments in every\nfirst-world nation and maybe other nations too seem to be\npreparing almost like marching in step with this thing this is\ncoordinated is not it absolutely and if you look at the legal framework they are all\nfollowing the same legal framework it is the international\nhealth regulations of 2005 which gives who the world health\norganization based in geneva the power to control how governments\nrespond to this pandemic \u2013 which who has itself declared every\ncountry has a more or less identical pandemic plan which hands power\nover to the world health organization which allows the world health\norganization to take over the police and health forces every country\nwill set up a crisis committee which will determine what vaccine\ncenters are established what groups are going to be targeted for\nvaccination and so on that\nis the reason why it is so coordinated and synchronized because\nthere is a single body behind it and this is the world health\norganization the un and the people who back that the banking\ncartel and family dynasties the rockefellers and the rothschilds now let us just back up a moment here and for those people\nwatching this video who do not know who you are and why we\nshould be talking here in vienna can you just give a little bit of\nyour background the things that you shared with me personally for\ninstance i did not even know that you were at the university of\nedinburgh how long you have been in vienna what you are\ndoing here and just a little bit of a bio how did you get to this\nplace sometimes you must wake up in the morning asking yourself the\nsame question how did you get here well my dad is austrian and my mother is from ireland and i was\nborn in switzerland i went to edinburgh university where i did\nenglish literature and language and a bit of philosophy and so on i\ncame to austria in the year 2000 i started working here as an editor\nfor a medical journal specializing in diabetes i quit that of my own\nfree will and started writing for medical wires reuters\nhealth for the british\nmedical journal the\nscientist nature and so on so i acquired an understanding of the medical field and\nhow to do research in this area then i eventually moved into renewable energy because i believe that is\na tremendous potential for humanity until one day this winter a\nneighbor showed me the report in a local newspaper saying that baxter\nhad contaminated this vaccine material and 36 people had to go to\nhospital to be treated preventatively for the bird flu then of course i understood this is a tremendous threat and that because\nbiosafety level 3 regulations are in place in these sorts\nof facilities it cannot have\nbeen an accident so your experience gained as a medical journalist immediately\nhelped you to realize that something very unusual and important had\nhappened here is that right absolutely absolutely i also felt competent about doing the\nresearch into it and filing charges which i did eventually because\nof that background i had done quite a lot of work in that field so\ni felt competent i could handle it okay now something which i do want to ask you is that many people\nhave understandably asked the question who\nis this woman and where has she come from out of nowhere and i can resonate with that because people say that about us and\npeople feel sometimes an understandable sense of territoriality it is\nlike wait a minute this\nis my area or wait\na minute i have been researching this for 20 years where does\nthis newcomer come from now were you conscious of the fact that when you started to write about\nthis stuff people would be saying who\nis this person we never heard her name before i have to be honest and say my concern was to try and stop and\npublicize what i saw as a big crime and threat i was very concerned\nthat there was no publicity no action being taking by the austrian\ngovernment and that baxter could release this material the day\nafter and it should have been news headlines all over the world absolutely it was underwhelming was not it it was underwhelming and that created the risk that they were just\ngoing to repeat the same maneuver and a pandemic was going to be\nignited because\ni myself had come to realize that the media was totally controlled through my own experiences working in the media i did not make\ntoo much effort in trying to alert the newspapers i sent the story or the pitch to bmj the editor was not interested i was not too surprised that is the british\nmedical journal yes for which i have worked the\nlancet was not\ninterested i sent it to the austrian papers no response profil an austrian magazine actually wrote an article whitewashing baxter in spite of all my\ninformation as\nan individual i saw very few opportunities for halting this\nmechanism or truck\nthat seemed to be hurtling towards unleashing a pandemic so i filed\ncriminal charges in the hope of putting a spoke in the wheel and\nforcing an investigation i had never done that before and did you have professional help in doing that because i would not\nknow how to start filing changes against anybody yes to be honest a lawyer did tell me i had to file criminal\ncharges and where to go and what were the basic laws so i did get\nthat advice on\nmy mother\u2019s side of the family there were some lawyers so my\nmum too was very good at kind of legal reasoning and stuff like\nthat so i decided to give it a shot i had never done it before but i thought i might as well give it a try the\nevidence was there it was just a question of laying it out clearly so that is what i did and the police did start investigating this is the police here in vienna right yes yes my understanding is that three police forces are\ninvestigating the police in vienna the police in\nkorneuburg\nand the unit for\nprotection of the constitution and fighting terrorism was also\ninvestigating \u2013 i know that for sure because i was summoned\nthere for an interview however what has alarmed me is the fact that nothing has happened the\ngovernment is continuing to press ahead with its program of mass\nvaccination with these baxter vaccines there are no security checks\nin place to ensure that the material is not contaminated the\nsituation is such that i might as well never have filed the charges last\nweek the head of the unit for protecting the constitution and\nfighting terrorism was forced to resign it seems and replaced by\nsomebody who appears to be much more loyal to the powers that want\nthis vaccination program to go ahead the same is true of the\naustrian criminal police \u2013 the head was replaced by somebody\nwho also has a track record of working for these so-called new world\norder corporations so i increasingly feel these structures in government are not going to\nbe effective in stopping and halting this danger and that is why\nwe have to now move towards organized civilian resistance to the\nvaccines but you must be encouraged because parallel with your\nmetaphorically waking up that morning to realize wait\na minute what is wrong with this picture there is\nsomething happening that should not be a lot of other people all over the world have been becoming very\naware of this and very active you must be feeling heartened by that yeah absolutely i mean the response has been amazing and exponential every day it is amazing to see the progress today\ni heard that the greek police are going to refuse and have\nofficially refused to take the vaccine \u2013 which is quite a\nsignificant milestone this is the police force which the government\nwill rely on to force the greeks to take a vaccine according to\npolls the greeks do not want to take the vaccine so eventually it\nwill come down to the government having to either force them or try\nand frighten them into taking it by tricking\na pandemic that is\njust one example in germany there is enormous resistance and so is\nthere in france not to mention the usa and increasingly in the uk unfortunately\nmy language skills are limited i do not speak spanish or any\nother language so i am only able to track am on to what is happening in the countries where i speak a bit of the\nlanguage which is france germany and the english-speaking\ncountries i just came back from poland where i gave a talk about a whole\nbunch of stuff including this to a large number of very awake and\naware and concerned people i was heartened because maybe like\nyourself i did not know anything about what was happening in\npoland people\nare very very concerned they are very aware that there is\na problem here it is being discussed a lot and just now i\nshowed you a document that had been prepared by a very highly\nrespected polish medic saying that this is completely out of order it should not be happening the vaccines are likely to be\ncontaminated the whole thing is spurious there is\nevidence that this wave is sort of growing all over the world and\nsome of this has been caused by your own civilian initiative now just to back up a little bit somewhere down the line and this may\nseem like quite a long time ago now you lost your job \u2013\nprobably because of this \u2013 did not you yes i did to be honest i cannot even remember now when it\nwas but i think it was at the end of june or the beginning of july i was unceremoniously informed that the reports that i had been\nscheduled to write were not required since i had been working there\nfor almost two years without any complaint and no reason was given it was clear to me that this was connected with the fact that i had\nfiled these criminal charges i\nalso went to the us embassy in vienna and filed charges with the fbi in part it was a symbolic gesture because the reputation of the fbi\nis perhaps not the greatest those charges that you filed was it with\nthe fbi or against\nthe fbi with the fbi so basically asking the fbi to investigate yes and you filed them at the american embassy here in vienna yes okay now some people in america have tried to follow the paper\ntrail and said that they could not find any evidence that these\ncharges had been filed it is possible that they never left whatever\nroom it was which you filed them in in the american embassy not really because i even sent copies by email to actually various fbi departments because i am well aware in the\nmeantime that there are within every police structure these people\nwho are obstructing investigations so my aim was not just to file them physically here in the us embassy but also to spread the word around other fbi departments throughout\nthe usa and i think i sent them to about ten or twelve okay i was also assured by an agent working at the us embassy that she\nhad sent the physical charges that i had filed in the official post or whatever to their washington headquarters so that was an\nassurance i received you must have reference numbers and records or some kind of receipt\nor copy no no i will be honest the fbi has not contacted me i rang them and they\ninformed me that i would not necessarily get contact from them the\nsituation is the scale of my charges was monumental in the sense that\nit kind of more or less alleges that the us government pharmaceutical companies and banking cartels are operating together\nto push forward this mass-murder program under the guise of offering\npeople vaccinations so i mean i would have been amazed if they had handled it as a\nregular kind of complaint you know given it a file number and all\nthe rest of it it took a while for the austrian police to assign a\ncase number to my case too okay the reason behind my question there was there are some people\nwho have tried to follow that trail and they have said that they\ncannot find any evidence \u2013 in the american system that they have\ntried to find these things in \u2013 that these charges have been\nfiled i just wondered whether there is any answer that you can\ngive to that in terms of a reference number this is where to look this is what it says no i cannot do anything nothing like that i filed them i have the evidence that i sent them to the fbi i\nhave the emails what\nthe fbi did unfortunately is outside my control if they have not\nregistered it if they have not assigned it a case number if\nthey have not recorded it as it is their duty and requirement\nto do so that is their problem and i am not responsible\nfor their lapses sure and that is it anybody who wants the emails proving that i\nalso emailed the fbi is very welcome to have them i mean i think\nthey are even up on the web somewhere so okay to some extent what you did was almost like a symbolic act as well as actually initiating charges which actually i mean is\nnot the kind of thing that most people usually take it upon\nthemselves to do so it was quite a valiant david-and-goliath action\nthere but it was symbolic and it was encouraging to a lot of\npeople do you feel that people have responded to it in that way well i think there is been as you pointed out a growing\nrecognition that this really is a threat and there is solid\nevidence that this is a threat this\nis something that i tried to lay out in the charges to explain the\nempirical evidence for my views so people can read through it and\nsee why i have reached these conclusions so can the fbi agents so can the police and so on on\nthe other hand there is no denying that these structures are\nextremely corrupt and if no investigation is initiated no case file\nnumbers are assigned it becomes increasingly clear over time that we\nthe people cannot rely on these so-called police and law-enforcement\nbranches to do their job and protect us against a threat this\nis what is becoming increasingly clear is that they are not\ndoing their job that the evidence is handed to them they are\nnot arresting the people they should be arresting they are not\nstopping the whole infrastructure for this mass vaccination program in spite of the dangers so at this point people are realizing that the justice system and the\nlaw enforcement system has nothing more to do with justice and law\nenforcement and this needs to be rebuilt and reconstituted indeed our entire societies need to be reconstituted on the basis of law and\norder justice the constitution if we are to have any hope of a\nfuture just before we went on camera here we were talking a little bit\nabout the ufo phenomenon which is something that you do not\neven pretend to know anything about and there is no reason why\nyou should \u2013 it is a different area you asked me whether\ni believed in that kind of information and of course the answer is\nthat we do  because we have extensively researched it but\nthere are power levels here that  whichever line of investigation\none follows in these alternative areas whether it is\nalternative health cancer cures free energy the suppression of all\nkinds of information of government activities that have been taking\nplace for longer than even i have been here  you find that\nthere is obstruction in the organization of our governments and our\nmilitaries and our intelligence services you will\nfind that the citizens if you try to ask questions you just do not\nget anywhere you have to be very dogged and then there are all\nkinds of psychological operations that are mounted against anyone who\ndares to stand up against goliath in the way that you have done that is certainly true i was aware of my working within the\nmainstream media that it is systematically controlled by a central\ngroup who have economic interests with oil or renewable energy or\nsuppressing renewable energy but what was new to me was the insight into the extent which the\nalternative media also seems to be controlled when i tried to do\nwhat i could do which was file these charges publicize these\ncharges i found myself attacked and accused of not having filed the\ncharges of not existing of all kinds of lies and the people who\ndid it i knew they were lying because they had the emails in\ntheir possession which showed that i had filed at least at the\nfbi i had done my bit i cannot be responsible for what the\nfbi does so it became clear to me then that these people were actually trying to\nobstruct justice and obstruct the discovery and action against this\nprogram and that they probably had been put in the alternative media\nlong ago to direct peoples attention away from the\nlegislation which allows mass false vaccination programs most\npeople i have spoken to have never heard of it they have no idea\nabout the international health regulations and about the national\npandemic plans that allow this somebody\ni know even wrote to the austrian health ministry recently and\ninquired about this and was told by i think a lawyer or a senior\nofficial that there was no way austrians can be forced to take this\nvaccination but this official obviously has not read the national pandemic plan\nand does not know about the international health regulations which make it absolutely crystal clear that austrians in the event\nof a pandemic level 6 emergency declaration actually have to follow\nthe orders of the world health organization and the world health\norganization can\nforce people to take vaccinations and also to go into quarantine so the extent of the ignorance of people about this vital legislation\nhas astonished me in fact i did not know about it until i did\nthe research and you would have thought that the alternative media\nwould have been telling people about this for years and informing\nthem about this danger but it seems they have not been there is\na big big knowledge gap here that has to be filled there\u2019re a lot of items on the\ninterest and agenda list of the alternative\nmedia and to some degree like any media they react to what the big\nstory is right now but they have\nreacted and there is a groundswell of awareness and understanding which does seem to be reaching places that it had not reached a\nlittle while before so something\u2019s definitely moving here is not it absolutely the way i see it in spite of the obstacles in spite of\nall these obstructions the word has got out with phenomenal unbelievable speed which i would never have believed was possible in\na million years it is just been a miraculous kind of almost\ninexplicable form of communication to my mind which is taking\nplace you know if you see this as a game \u2013 and i do not use that word in\na trivial sense \u2013 if you see this as a game how is the game\nset up now what do you think the moves in the game are likely to be are\nthe citizens of the world starting to wake up more than was\nanticipated what is likely to be the response can you think\nthe way that \u201cthey whoever \u201cthey how are they thinking and what might they do well i believe that the speed of the awakening has taken these\npeople by surprise and it is making them extremely nervous and\nworried they have put in place this plan for the collapse of the\neconomy in parallel or synchronization with this mass vaccination\nprogram which is designed to kill or injure a large number of\npeople then\ni think they have plans for famines and wars and various other\nthings and for moving countries under the control of the world\nhealth organization and the un which indeed will be the result of\nthis pandemic declaration of one world government i\ndo not believe that they are very flexible and can see any way\nto back down now so i think they are pressing ahead they are\neven accelerating their efforts to get this vaccine into the\npopulation by stealth and secrecy i\nthink they are going to try and trigger a pandemic by whatever\nmeans they can in the next few days weeks they are going to be\nputting it out in schools as well as injecting it into people there\nwas an incident in a swiss train where vials of so-called swine flu\nthat was supposed to be being transported to the national flu center\nexploded on a swiss train was that avian flu or swine flu swine flu that was swine flu back in april so we have some\nglimpses of the methods that they are willing to use to spread\ndisease \u2013 very very curious incident why it was being\ntransported on a train at all and by accelerating this pandemic by\nmaking it ever more virulent they hope to panic people into taking\nthe vaccine which will make it truly disastrous and justify false\nmass vaccinations i\nthink they hope that the hierarchical structures in the habit of\nobedience will be sufficient in the panic and confusion that ensues to see them through this that is what i think they hope and\nbelieve the habit of obedience i love that term unfortunately we  all of us  have to examine ourselves at this\npoint and ask how far have we internalized a habit of deference and\nobedience that is really not justified and needs to be we need to\nregain our sense of our own judgments and reliance on our own\njudgments and our willingness to stand up against patently corrupt\nand criminal authorities and refuse to go along with it that is\nwhy i am now thinking that what we need is actually a kind of\norganized peaceful revolution so that we can finally take back our\ngovernments restore our legal systems and our constitutions and\nrebuild our economies our health systems and our education systems\n and put these people who are responsible for this in jail once\nand for all so they cannot continue doing this damage to us even\nhere in austria i think word is spreading and people are going to\nrefuse it will be interesting to see how it works out i mean my\nhope would be that the movement reaches the point where the\nnonviolent refusals will be more than enough to destroy and shatter\nthis plan some people have written to us and they have said look you are not going to have a policeman with a gun knocking on\nyour door accompanied by a doctor with a syringe they have not got the\nresources to do that how actually could they enforce it if they wanted to how could it\nhappen what would be the sanctions which they have well the french government released or circulated to the heads of\ndepartments an internal document of 19 pages which outlined quite\nclearly their method and this is what i assume is happening in every\ncountry they are\ngoing to set up vaccine centers that are outside hospitals and gps some of these are going to be secure people\nare going to be told to go there first of their own free will and\nthen they are going to receive calls or whatever telling them\nto appear at a certain time and those people who do not come are\ngoing to eventually be collected and forced to go there do the resources exist to actually do that you are talking\nabout transporting and enforcing and rounding up and making contact\nwith hundreds of thousands of people and possibly many more than\nthat well initially if so many people refuse it will be impossible but if they are assuming that the vast majority of people will\neither go of their free will or when they get the call from say a\npolice authority telling them to appear or a notification they\nwill go reluctantly but they will still obey that call the number\nof people who will actually refuse to go and stay at home when\nthey are informed it is a criminal offense not to go will\nbe very small and it will be a criminal offense not to go they are\nassuming that the vast majority of people when they get a call out\nof the blue as it is planned in switzerland that the police go\nthrough the registry of people who live in the canton ring them up\nand tell them to go to the vaccine center that most will do it and\nthat there will be actually very few that need to be collected by the\npolice i\nthink they have special pandemic police task forces there they will not\nbe counting too much on the regular police to do this and they are\nanticipating i think that they can go around and collect those\npeople however if it turns out that hundreds of thousands and millions refuse to go then they cannot carry it through that is why it is\nimportant for every single person to say \u201cno and not to\ngo along with it so it is a propaganda war or a propaganda game absolutely they do not have the resources they are\nrelying on people going of their free will to go to these vaccine\ncenters then they are relying on just being able to make a call\nto people telling them it is a criminal offense not to go putting psychological pressure on people to go then they are\nrelying on a very relatively small number of people actually saying no i am staying in my home i am not going on any account and waiting for the police to knock on the door and drag them off at\nthat point they will have sufficient forces if few people do it to\nactually go around and collect people from their homes now fear and concern for one\u2019s personal safety is a great\nmotivator are you expecting just as in 1918 that there is\ngoing to be a second wave of the existing swine flu in a mutated form\nwhich really is\na problem accompanied by very alarmist media reports showing people\ndying and funerals and all of this kind of stuff that is going\nto scare people into lining up for their voluntary vaccinations absolutely it is already happening i think the scientists in\ncanada have looked at people who have died from the so-called\nswine flu and they found that those people have the damage to their\nlungs which is consistent with them having got the bird flu and\nso how is it explicable i mean they must have been given the bird\nflu so they have been getting it from somewhere and it could\nhave been from the kind of contamination of vaccine material that\noccurred here in austria where normal vaccine material was\ncontaminated with the bird flu so they are already starting and trying to trigger this really\nvirulent pandemic the cdc and who have stopped counting or tracking\nthese cases so we could be seeing the multiplication of these\nvirulent cases already now in the usa and canada at\nsome point the media will focus on it they will focus on the\nterrible deaths of these people from holes in their lungs and\nwhatever and this moved\n panic when vaccine\ncenters are opened people\nwill be saying oh those\npeople who were saying it was the vaccine have got it all wrong they\nwere lying to us it is actually the virus that is the real\ndanger people in this\nfear and confused state of mind will think maybe it was all lies\nabout the vaccine and they will rush off and get their vaccine\nwhich will then kill them and create an even more virulent virus yeah something which i realized just a short while ago was that in\norder to really introduce something dangerous to large numbers of the\npopulation they do not have to vaccinate everybody just to\nillustrate the point if i do not get vaccinated but you do and\nso does your friend and then we all meet for dinner to talk about it and i say well i am\nall right i have not been vaccinated\n there is something now cooking in your bodies that i am\ngoing to catch simply because we shook hands over dinner absolutely so they do not have to get everyone right no i mean i think that they would also like to use the opportunity\nto put in people these nanochips there is mounting evidence\nthat baxter and so on is planning to put into its swine flu vaccine\nthese nanochips and certainly who has put in place the legal\nframework and the technical framework to vaccinate everybody so i\nthink they really are aiming for maximum possible coverage but\nto kill people they do not need to vaccinate everyone they\njust need to vaccinate enough people to unleash this really virulent\npandemic eventually\npeople will just put on their face masks or use their colloidal\nsilver sensible people will already be thinking of taking these\nmeasures if there is any threat of a virus they will be\nhaving their face masks on and boosting their immune systems with\nvitamin c and and d3 i believe d3 and so to try and reduce the number of people who survive by\ntaking these measures i think they would like to get as many\nvaccinated as possible because this will mean the disease goes\nstraight in your bloodstream and there is nothing you can do basically once it is there okay so what you are flagging up here is that there are two\nscenarios going on here this all sounds very black and stark but\nthere is the genocide scenario and there is the total\ncontrol scenario and they can go hand-in-hand with each other yes i believe that is the plan the who has i understand put\nin places a comprehensive electronic surveillance system already and\nas soon as we get our nanochips with all the information about our\nhealth and the health insurance associations and whatever they will\nbe able to track us by satellite and computers whatever they have for the rest of our lives even if we survive the pandemic the\nvaccination the wars the famines and so on so in this way they will have managed to not only establish a one world\ngovernment but also a technical structure to control every single\none of us on the planet we have had it told us by a number of insiders on and off record\nthat this whole structure just exists already they have got the\ndatabases they have got a lot of information on most people they are doing all this for a reason this is like the final\nmatch that is lit to the fire if you like so my question to you then is based on what you know  because you\nmust also have people writing to you presumably confidentially offering information i have had a few private confidential emails from people who have\nbeen saying they agree with what i am saying with the\nbioterrorism charges but because of their positions they are\nnot able to come out and say that openly and obviously i do not\npublish that kind of thing either but i am not a goldmine of secret information the thing is it is\nall out there it is all out there if you just read the pandemic\nplans if you read the international health regulations and so on the\nreason why people are mystified is because the mainstream media\nconsistently deflects attention from these crucial facts or puts a\nspin on them which misleads people about what their nature like\nthis pandemic is natural and caused by pigs  when it is never\nbeen found in pigs it is\nnot new the swine flu according to the new\nengland journal of medicine there is an article documenting cases of it in people since\n2005 2009 it was not spreading it was not lethal you\nknow so the mainstream media is what are really mystifying misleading\npeople all i am doing is looking at the facts behind the media\nand bringing them together into relationships so that people can see\nthe bigger pattern that is it what is the time scale do you think from here this is the\neighth of september and we will get this out in the next few\ndays if we possibly can do because time is of the essence what do\nyou think is going to happen as we roll on towards the new year well i think these few weeks are crucial to humanity i believe all\nthe plans are in place to start these vaccination centers from\noctober and indeed people are going to be offered time off work \u2013\nin cities like boston two hours i think unpaid leave to go and get\ntheir swine flu jab kids are going to be offered it free so everything is going to be done at first to persuade people to take\nthis vaccine and already we have to stop that we have to make sure\nthe protest is significantly large that these vaccine centers do not\nstart injecting children the gullible the uninformed whatever with disease which can then be transmitted to other children sitting\nin schools to their parents and then to their colleagues at work that is a perfect place to spread it all in\nschools is not it absolutely unfortunately the army is another place the soldiers\nare very vulnerable they seem to be the first ones involved to get\nthese mass forced vaccinations so we do not have a minute to lose it is going to be too late\nwhen the call finally comes through the\nforced\nvaccinations  demands come through \u2013 barring a miracle so\nfar they have not managed to spark the virulent pandemic they\nhoped to in april i think they really hoped that they had set free\na virus that was going to mutate and become very virulent and they\ndid not manage it and maybe they will not manage it this\ntime either but the more people they vaccinate the greater the\nchances are that they really will spark a lethal pandemic bear\nin mind baxter sent two kilos of live bird flu virus it is\nstill in the company\u2019s possession it could be put into the\nvaccines here and if every austrian or every third or second austrian\ngets it it spreads rapidly to germany to the czech republic to\nslovenia to poland and it will kill many many people well it spreads almost instantly nowadays in these days of modern\ntravel i mean in 1918 people were traveling by steamships and\nthis is rather different now yes and particularly the schools and the workplaces and so on i\nthink we do not have that much time i think they are reckoning\nwith being able to move towards forced vaccinations towards the end\nof the year maybe kind of gradually from november december \njanuary but i think we have to stop even the voluntary mass\nvaccinations starting from october so what is your message to people here because some people\nwill be watching this thinking right i am going to get my colloidal silver and everything else and\ni am not going to get vaccinated and thanks for the information but is that enough well i personally believe it is not because we are in a\nsituation here where even if you have your colloidal silver and your\nface mask your neighbor might get vaccinated or you might be in\ncontact with somebody at work so it is in the interest of everybody to try and stick together and\ndo things like protest outside vaccine centers protest to make sure\nschools stay closed there is no reason to keep them open or if\nkids have to go to these schools they should be given face masks and\nother sensible measures to protect them in school from these viruses so i believe that we should all be looking out for each other because ultimately we are looking out for our own interests when we\nstop this pandemic from being ignited and gathering speed however if all you are willing to do is take the colloidal silver and a\nface mask  fine as long as you are willing then when the\norder comes for you to take it or to go to quarantine to resist at\nthat point or be faced with being imprisoned or whatever at that\npoint i would suggest it is getting a little bit late how much support are you getting personally how do you feel because you are like a lonely soldier here fighting this in\naustria sort of unconnected at least physically with the rest of\nthe world  what it is that sustains you and keeps you going and\ngives you the strength to keep on fighting because it is not\neasy is it well i have to say i look at the evidence and i see that there is a\nreal threat also to me i mean i am also going to be one of the\npeople who could be infected by this pandemic virus who could be\nforced to take this vaccination i am stamped a criminal if i\ndo not take it and this is not a very palatable kind of\nprospect it is\nnot exactly how i want to spend my time either sick or prematurely\ndead from something like this so i am motivated also by\nself-interest as well as the desire to see other people of\ncourse freed from this threat do you have a team who are working with you do you feel supported\nlogistically emotionally financially or is it just really that\nyou are just standing alone here in vienna oh no i mean i have\njohann michelson\n in\nswitzerland has volunteered to put up my website i met him the other day he is a wonderful man yes and he is done great work and put up a wonderful website and a lot of people\nsupport and send\nemails and reports and information that i put up on my website and so\non [ https www.theflucase.com here in austria there is somebody who has an email database\nof 140,000 emails who is starting to send out information so\neven the austrians are getting to hear what is happening so i\ncertainly feel not alone however there is no doubt about it that i for example have very little\nfinancial resources and i more or less have to try and scrape by and\nthis limits how effective i can be i cannot cover countries\noutside of europe or try and launch the kind of legal action that i\nwould have wished to launch the injunctions in\ncases like africa or latin america no substantial funding has come\nfrom any source whatsoever to help in this battle so it is been\nindividuals sending relatively small sums of money or offering to do\nthings like a dvd or whatever that has nevertheless been very very important and you are personally contactable if there is anyone\nwatching this now who is able to offer material support in a\nposition to do that they can reach you through your website right yes they can just find my email address i am certainly very\nvisible i think for anybody who wants to actually contact me but\nso far there has been no foundation or wealthy person or anything\nlike that who has offered support and i am not even saying they need to offer me\npersonal support but there is been no major support for any\ninjunctions or any kind of these legal actions or for the movement\nas a whole it really is a grassroots movement and that is a\nheartening thing to see that it has become very strong in spite of\nthe fact that there has been very little support well your work is an inspiration to many others may i say i think\nthis really is a david-and-goliath example that you have given a\nlot of people here are\nyou hopeful are you optimistic or are you depressed about the whole\nthing thinking my god we are all about to be wiped out here or do you think that it is just something which is\ngoing to work out well but we have got to do a lot of work\nbetween now and then well my heart\ntells me without any doubt this is going to work out well for\nhumanity my mind\nlooks at the evidence and i get worried you know unfortunately i think we all have to play our roles and depend on\nevery single person now the structures of government have failed us they are against us they are actually turning against us\nto try and destroy us it\nreally is up to every single individual now to stand up say \u201cno and organize to remove these structures once and for all and open the\nway for us every single person to have a new future of dignity of\nfreedom where we can enjoy our lives free of stress free of worry\nas we were meant to enjoy our lives and open the way for the next\ngeneration to have proper healthy opportunities sensible working\nconditions good education systems and for humanity to begin a new\nera free of these monstrous plots against us jane b\u00e3\u00bcrgermeister thank you so much thank you bill bill ryan (br it is\na paradox i love the way that david icke explained it on saturday that we are infinite love infinite consciousness temporarily\nexperiencing what it is like to be here with our feet on the\nground trying to figure it all out and what we are doing is\nwe are playing games we are just playing games that does not mean there is\nanything trivial about it but what else is a spiritual playful\nbeing going to do in all of eternity apart from to play games that is a good way to learn this is all a big training course and so there is a paradox because\njust like children playing in the playground at school it feels\nimportant when they are playing some game and somebody\u2019s\ntrying to chase them and they are trying to catch them and\nthey are trying to get away and they are trying to figure\nout all this kind of stuff or just like being in a movie it is\njust another kind of game it feels important but the paradox is\nthat it is not so i am enjoying pretending that\nthis is important \u2013 but it is not \u2013 because i know\nwho i am that gives us our ground of security if they kill me i\ndo not care i will just come back it does not matter\nat all i like the line in star\nwars where obi-wan kenobi\nsays to darth vader if you\nkill me i will be more powerful than you can ever imagine melani from freedom central (fc mm interesting and so this is why it is\nvery important not to fall into the trap which we are intended\nto fall into of believing\nthis illusion that we are small mortal powerless temporarily-animated hunks of meat and when it is all over then that is the end and in the meantime we have got to\nfight for survival and worry about how we are going to feed\nourselves and clothe ourselves and keep warm and all this stuff\nthat is at the bottom level of maslow\u2019s triangle the real truth is somewhere else and\nthis is why just as david icke has been saying in every presentation\nhe is been giving this year this is why he starts with the\nfundamental reality that who\nwe are is the biggest secret universities destroy knowledge and\nreligions destroy spirituality this is where we are at today so we are not talking about\nbelieving anything you have to get above all of that and when\nyou are above all of that looking down at the whole thing having taken off into the clouds and this is what for lack of any\nbetter word we can call the spiritual\nrealm not the astral\nrealm where you are\ntalking about ghosts and ghoulies and inter-dimensional beings who\u2019re\nplaying games just as we play games down here you just cannot\nsee them it is just the same they are just non-physical\nin our terms but when you get above all that then\nyou look down at the whole thing and all you are looking at is\nyou are looking at a virtual reality game and that is why\nit does not matter but when you and i are playing a\nvirtual reality game on our computer if we do that or going to see\nthe 2012\nmovie we will be feeling this in our body viscerally \u2013 it\nfeels important it is like we want to win or we want somebody\nelse to win if we are watching the game but it is just a\ngame everything\u2019s a game and so i am enjoying the game this is like a personal statement what gives me what it feels like gives me strength in the game is\nthe knowledge of who i am because that is home base that is\nwhere you go back to that is where you return to after the\nmovie is over and then you talk about it and you think about it and\nyou think hey that was fun\n i will go back and do that one again next week this is why fighting does not\nwork because fighting continues the game we have been fighting\nfor millions billions trillions possibly quadrillions of years and all that does it just prolongs the game and so this is a variant of what\neinstein said that a\nproblem cannot be solved by the level of consciousness which\nproduced the problem in the first place we have got to rise above that and the application of that in\nthe situation is you cannot solve this problem on planet earth\nby being a human being just being a human being because that is\nthe level of consciousness which has created the problem you can only resolve this problem from\na spiritual standpoint love is universal and that capacity that we\nall have as spiritual beings must never be forgotten david icke has said this in his own\nway he is looking at the illuminati he is looking at the\nreptilians he is looking at the child-eaters he is\nlooking at the torturers he is looking at the warmongers and\nhe is saying i feel\nsorry for them they have lost their way they are spiritual\nbeings who have forgotten who they are they are playing a\ngame and they are still stuck in it at a different level they have\ngot all kinds of abilities they have got billions of dollars they have got psychic abilities and the help of nasty ets but\nthey do not know who they really are they cannot get out\nof their trap either because they have been doing it for\nbillions of years also this whole thing has been rolling on\nforever almost but it does not matter what else are we\ngoing to do in all of eternity you see it is fun and you have\ngot to see it as fun this is why i enjoy my work because\nit is a game but it is a very serious game you know if\nsomebody actually put a pistol to my head i do not really know\nwhat i would do you know my body would be frightened because the body is just an animal like the car that we are\ndriving and animals get frightened when they are threatened my\nbody would probably be frightened as a spiritual being i would think oh i wonder what it is\ngoing to be like going into the light you\nsee so obviously the whole search\nitself is very important for people this is something i really want\nto focus on you say you understand and know who you are does that\nhave to do also with understanding your past lives and how they\nimpact here yes sure i spent hundreds of\nyears in tibet and i came to the west in 1850 i was born into a\nvictorian family in london and it seemed like a good idea at the\ntime i know a lot of people who have\ncome from other cultures shamanic cultures or from other planets it does not really matter but we are not talking about this\nvery locked-down programmed reality as david icke would put it that is our current post-industrial western world which is very\nheavily under control whereas our spirituality actually has taken a\nretrograde step compared the aborigines and the bushman and the\nshamans in south america who understand the whole story and have for\nthousands of years you know so i came to the west it seemed like\na good idea at the time i picked up information when i was\nmeditating in tibet that those\nguys over there need help i do not know where they are i do not\nknow who they are but that is where i am going next time\nbecause they need help i got hit really hard because this is\nwhat happens to everyone who comes from anywhere else it does not\nmatter where you come from when you come into this reality and you\nget knocked on the head big time and many people do not make\nit in their first lifetime it is tougher than they think and i did not make it that first\nlifetime meaning that it was a bit of a tragedy and that all kinds\nof strange things happened and i could tell the drama but it is\njust drama it is a lifetime so what okay start again reset control-alt-delete reset come back do it again you know and i finally got my act together this\ntime i had a number of things i know who i was since then i have\nsome adventurous times it is not really the subject of this\ninterview i could go on for a long time no i love it please do but you see if we go exploring\nour past lives in a way that is more drama that we go into it is like oh my god i was cleopatra or oh my god i was this nasty person or i was this\ngood it does not matter that is\nover it does not matter but it can\ngive us some insight into patterns that we repeat this lifetime which come from a program that is remaining from an old situation\nthat we still think is happening now this is why people are afraid of\ndrowning why because they had a nasty situation with water in their\nprevious lifetime they are afraid of water when they are\nthree years old why because it happened before and so much that we set up here is\npart of our mental reaction not our spiritual reaction because the mind is something that we take with us i have a slightly\ndifferent definition of \u201cmind than david icke does but\nthen that is another story as well we are not really\ntalking about semantics here but so much of what we set up for\nourselves when we put the chess pieces back on the board and we start\nthe game again in another lifetime is some kind of residue from the\npast and this is the only reason why it is important to clear\nthings out not because oh i was this this is so interesting this is fascinating and i am\ngoing to write a book about it it is not important the reason\nwhy you find out about it is so you can forget all about it and let\nit go so that it does not influence you now so that you are\ncompletely free so that you are making real\nchoices now in present time and that is why once again\nwe are talking words but any kind of clearing technique \u2013\nregression can do it there are many other practices that do it as\nwell you can even do it in meditation this is why remembering the\npast is powerful not so that we reminisce but so that we can let\ngo and that is the key to it because only then can you be really really here and now that is\nwhen you have all of your power when you have unshackled these\nheavy weights from your feet and many of those are actually rooted\nin the past what we see here on planet earth with\nall of these things that are perfectly real we have got very\nnasty people who have got their own karma they have got\ntheir own past they have got their own trap they are\nplaying their own game they have got their own purposes they have\ncome from their own places they have come here from other\nplaces too it is just a continuation of the\nsame thing and so this is why what david icke says is correct that\nyou are not going to handle this by protesting on the streets you are not going to handle this by taking a hundred-thousand\nchinese assassins and go to murder them all it just continues it all fighting\ndoes not work what project camelot is doing is\nbringing knowledge to the people about what we are not\ntaught in schools what children are not taught by their parents what we do not read in the newspaper \u2013 and it is what\nyou are doing here in the work that you are doing \u2013\nis that we have to know the truth about where are because if here\nwe are in zurich if we want to drive to paris and we have got a\nmap in front of us we have to know where we are otherwise we are\nnever going to go down the right road to get to where we want to go\nto what one has to do is not to get\nlocked into intentions so that one is controlled by the intentions rather than the intentions being a product of one\u2019s own desire\nto reach an outcome that intention you cannot make\nyourself a cup of coffee or get up in the morning or answer the\ntelephone and once again this is an aspect of the paradox in the\nhighest possible level these things do not matter it does not\nmatter whether you have a cup of coffee in the morning it does not\nmatter whether you answer the phone it does not matter whether\nthe world blows up in 2012 so what we will just find another\nplanet and come back it does not matter but on the other hand in the context\nof the game it does matter and you cannot have a game without\nintentions it is very important to separate out these two\nrealities and they coexist in a working paradox for me my answer to the question that\nyou asked ruth about what advice would i give people i would totally\nrecommend you find out who\nyou are  because if you\ndo not really know who you are you do not have that\nreservoir of strength and certainty which is going to see you through\nany situation whatsoever even if someone\u2019s holding a gun to\nyour head or a needle against your arm you know who you are secondly i had say it is\nhelpful to know where you come from because that then can help you\nfigure out what programs are running you this lifetime that are\nunconscious and which are your true free choices you have got to be able to\nseparate this out otherwise if you feel like doing something you\ndo not know where it is that that is come from you do not\nknow whether it is an old program or whether it is\nsomething that is a really smart choice thirdly i had say do not\nfight fourthly i had say you have to\nunderstand that these guys need help and not in a condescending way there are people all over the world who are doing real spiritual\nwork the word \u201cwork is applicable here because it takes\ntime it takes focus it takes energy you have got to shut the\ndoor you have got to do whatever it is that you do there are a whole bunch of ways of\ndoing it and i do this too kerry does it a lot of people do it\nthat i know they are handling problems in the non-physical realm\nwhere these games are not playing there are a lot of non-physical beings\nthat need therapy they are upset they need someone to talk to something happened a billion years ago and they are still angry\nbut they do not have anyone to talk to are they manipulating us while\nthey are doing this yes sure they are just\ntaking out their anger like a kid on the street who is had a bad\nchildhood and then they go around wrecking the place that kid\nprobably needs help he does not need prison he needs someone\nto talk to he needs a friend he needs somebody to say you\nknow what you are a wonderful being you have had a hell of an\nexperience tell me about it what happened back then did your\nfather abuse you did your big brother beat you up what happened to\nyou that is made you so angry he might just start to get to the\nbottom of that because that is his past now one can\ncommunicate with these non-physical beings just as you can\ncommunicate with the kid in the street if you can get him to talk to\nyou they have got problems they are screwed up they are angry they are\nupset they have had stuff done to them they have got a\ncycle of abuse that happens just on a physical level where you have\ngot somebody who was abused by their parents then becomes the abuser\nof their own children they pass it on the reason why they pass it on is\nbecause they go into the identity that they are the winner in\nthe game it is like i\nlost that game so i have got to adopt the winning strategy what is the winning strategy i become the abuser and i win they see it this way this is how all these situations get\nperpetuated and in the non-physical realm it\nhappens in exactly the same way you have to communicate with these\nbeings telepathically there are ways to do it you can use\nbiofeedback machines or you can do it in meditation you can handle\nthese guys and i know people who are doing a lot of work with this what is really important is that\nevery significant presenter of information in the realm in which you\nand i and we are operating in many many of we are\nworking as a huge team project camelot david icke our friends\ndavid wilcock alex collier george green a whole bunch of people including people i do not even know they all have a profound\nspiritual orientation \u2013 every single one of them now we met patrick geryl the reason\nwhy he is wrong is because he does not have a spiritual\norientation he is a scientist he is trying to figure it\nout using mathematics he will never do that it does not work\nthat way bill deagle  we spoke to bill deagle\nfor an hour and a half last night he is a profoundly spiritual\nperson kerry is profoundly spiritual person we spoke about bob dean our great\nfriend he is a wonderful wonderful man everyone we speak to and almost all the unifying thread of all the people who we talk to they are profoundly spiritual people you spoke with david icke he starts\noff his seven-hour presentation by talking about how we are all\nuniversal consciousness and infinite love what kind of a spiritual\nmessage is that we need to hear more of that and so everyone who is really working\nhard as educators to i do not know what words to use here to wake people up but to remind people of what they already know you see the words remind\nand remember they are important words because you cannot be reminded of\nsomething that you do not already know you cannot\nre-cog-nize\nsomething that you do not already know that is where that\nword comes from to re-cognize\nit to re-know\nit this is why when people read books\nlike ruth\u2019s book or like many many other books \u2013 some\npeople have different reference points like the law\nof one they will read a\npage and then they go ahhh now i understand but it is not new\ninformation  it is old information that they are\nrecalling you see in my personal opinion we are not evolving we are recovering i think this is a profound misapprehension in much spiritual teaching\nthat we are somehow evolving from amoeba into some spiritual being no-no-no-no-no we were all gods we started off as\ngods we are all in a fallen state we are all god-like\nbeings who have forgotten who we are and so we are getting it\nback again we are recovering we are clawing ourselves\nback out of the mud-hole washing ourselves down getting all of the\nstuff off us and we are remembering who we were so it is a recovery process it is\nnot an evolution at all an evolution is to discredit who we really\nwere because we started as gods you see it is a fundamental\norientation that is missing everyone has their own touchstone their own seed crystal\nwhich is going to start that process of reawakening themselves there is no right answer your right answer might be an\ninappropriate answer or not such a workable for somebody else we all\nhave to find our own answers once again referencing what david\nicke was saying a couple of days ago this is why i will never want\nto work against someone else\u2019s intuition if your intuition is\npulling you to read the law\nof one and if you are\ngetting good value from that i say whatever you are doing\nthat is working you keep on doing it if someone else says to me well\ni picked up the law of one and i could not understand a word of\nit i say okay it is not the right book go find something else and that is a variant of\nsomething else that i wanted to say because a lot of people write to\nus or come up to me and talk to me saying what\nshould i do where should i go what is a safe place to be what\naction should i take and you have to be a mirror and\nreflect it back you have to say what\nyou are here to do is probably different or may be different from\nwhat i am here to do do not try and copy me be yourself and the reason why you need to find out more about who you are rediscover your strength look at your past meditate do whatever\nprocesses or techniques are appropriate for you to remember why are\nyou here \u2013 because\nyou are here to do a job this is what you refer to as in the\nlaw of one as being a wanderer there are many many terms for this dolores cannon did a wonderful\ncoast to coast show about three or four weeks ago when she referred\nto these people as volunteers it is a very simple word we are\nvolunteers from all over the universe different dimensions different planets maybe different cultures even on planet earth it is like okay i am\ngoing to try and help this movement here because these guys need\nhelp and some people say well where should i go should i go to australia should i go to canada what is a safe place to be should i go to peru should i go to you know it is like well where i should go might be different from where you should go because maybe one of the reasons why you should go there is because\nyou have got to meet someone or you have got to do a job you do not know what your life\nplan is and everyone\u2019s got a life plan you think you came\nhere without a plan you have got a plan everyone\u2019s got a\nplan everyone watching this video has got a plan it is smart to know what your\nplan is if you do not know what your plan is it is only\nbecause you do not remember it and the way to figure out what\nyour plan is \u2013 it is not really a question \u2013 saying oh i remember you will re-cog-nize\nit when it comes to you one of the indicators of what your\nplan is is because it gives you energy you start thinking about it\nand it is like wow i\nreally want to do this it\ngives you energy to think about it and you see work the word work\nis a relatively modern word what it really means is something that\nyou do not want to do animals do not work animals just exist in the marquesas\nislands which is a\ngroup of french islands in the south pacific in their language there is no word for work they catch a fish they light a fire they build a hut they shelter\nfrom the rain they go hunting they sing a song they do not\nwork why are we working we are working\nbecause someone has got an idea of how we should structure this work we do not work we live and for me i am at my happiest often and i am not even\ngoing to use the word \u201cwork in this sentence i am at my happiest when i am at my most\nactive and the definition of happiness which i use for myself is not like ah now i am on a cloud\nand i am happy and i am sitting with a metaphorical gin and\ntonic watching the sunset that is boring for me personally happiness for me is a direction it is a dynamic\nprocess it is being on target towards something that you want\nto do or you want to accomplish it is not a fixed intention like right i am going\nto kill somebody now i am going to do this and i am locked\ninto this idea but it is a purpose and we all\ncame here with a purpose and when we are on that purpose then\nit no longer feels like work it feels like a joy sure our bodies get tired we talked\nto david icke yesterday and he was absolutely exhausted but he was\nalso joyful in the job that he does because he is somebody who is\nbeen woken up to doing what it was that he came here to do what you and i can do and what i\nthink is happening in this movement that we call the \u201cground\ncrew is that people are on the way to realizing something\nthat they want to do in the ground crew meeting here in zurich that\nwe will be having in a week\u2019s time it is not about\norganizing people it is about inspiring people to say okay i am not going to tell you what to do what do you want to do and if you want to organize a food co-op then who else wants to help\nthis person who is enthusiastic the\nperson whose hand goes up really quickly they are the guy who\nshould help this person it is not about organizing people\ninto a kind of militant army it is about allowing oneself to\nunderstand what it is that one is really here to do that process of\nunderstanding i think is part of the awakening process that you\nasked ruth about that there is an awakening process happening i\ndo not understand it but it is happening everyone we speak to everyone we meet\nwhen we are traveling everyone we talk to who has also been\ntraveling and who reports back from conferences that they have\nbeen to this phenomenon is happening like a wave there is a\nwave of the expansion of consciousness and again i totally agree with david\nicke\u2019s representation of this that the powers that be are\nreally really worried about this because otherwise they would not\nhave to lock down on us so hard this is why they have got to\nmicrochip us or control us or prevent us from traveling or prevent\nus from communicating or eavesdrop on our conversations or try and\nput something in our bodies through a needle that is going to\ncompromise the effectiveness of this vehicle that we are all\ndependant on here in this reality to move around they have to do that they have to do\nall\nof those things because they have got no other power and what\ndoes that tell us about the limitation of the box that they are\nin i just love the way that david icke\ncharacterizes that and for me that says okay i agree with him that\nit may get complicated it may get really interesting it may get\nmore difficult we may have all kinds of problems that we have not\nencountered so far in our lives up until this point but another story that david icke told\nin his presentation was how he was told by a channel 19 years ago\nthat one of the many things that will happen as this wave of\nconsciousness grows is that we need to organize ourselves into\ngroups because together we will be stronger on a logistical practical level we have to form communities we need\nto form collectives which are able to handle things logistically simply because here on planet earth we are dependent on keeping\nour bodies alive we need food we need water we need heat we need\nshelter we need protection we do not need to have needles\ninside us we do not need to have things which are sprayed in\nthe atmosphere through chemtrails there is a whole thing going\non electronically our minds are influenced on a physical level our bodies are compromised and there are ways together that we\ncan support ourselves there are antidotes to all of these things there are technological ways that we can shield ourselves from this\nand we need to help each other when the pressure really really\nstarts to crank up everyone that we know says it is\ngoing to get worse before it gets better and i would agree with\nthat i do not know how bad it is going to be i do not\nknow what the timeline\u2019s going to be i think it is going\nto get tricky it is not the end of the world it is not\nthe end of the human race i think it is the most amazing\ntraining course and i think it is quite tough and at the end of\nall of this there is going to be something which we emerge into\nwhich will be a wonderful new start for the human race but between now and then i do not\nknow how long it is going to be i do not whether it is\ntwo years or three years or ten years but after that i think that\nwe will have emerged from all of this and that is it going to be\na fantastic recovery process i want to be around to see that happen because that really sounds like fun to me last night we were talking to bill\ndeagle who was saying that he thought the time scale might extend to\n2019 he does not buy the 2012 stuff either but between now and\nthen there may be a lot of things to handle i must say just going to back to\neverybody has to find what it is they came here to do \u2013 like i\nsay you come to the point where you say yes yes i want to do that that is\nexactly what happened when i started watching project camelot i am\nnot joking and i have said this before to kerry that i lost weeks\nof my life and with that i knew what i had to do i came to the conference that you had\non the first of august in amsterdam spoke to you and i think my\nhusband said to you how do\nyou do what you do and he\nhad quite an emotional\nconversation with you with that at that conference we knew exactly\nwhat it was we had to do i had media experience and i thought all right i know that this\nis something that i could happily go into i am not going to\nworry about money i am not going to worry about how much money\ni am going to make my\nbig house i am\njust going to do it because i feel that there is nothing in the\nworld that i had rather do more and i still feel that way in spite of\nvarious things that have happened to us and our information being\nconfiscated by the powers that be or whoever it was at various\npoints i think it is very important for\npeople to wake up and realize that we all have a part to play and\nthey need to figure out what it is why they came here and what it\nis they chose to do when they came here and why are not they\ndoing it you know yes if you jump off the cliff the angels will always catch you but you will never know until\nyou jump yes very true and they have\ncaught us we have been very very blessed absolutely so it is got\nsomething to do with trust it is got something to do with\ncourage it is got something to do with daring to believe that\nyou can be all you can be \u2013 and i do not want to sound\nlike an american military commander here you know but actually before i entered this\nphase of my life where i was working 24/7 on project camelot i was a\nteam-building specialist personal development specialist i have\ngot outdoor experience i used to take people up in the mountains i\nstarted off my career when i was 21 or 22 years old in outward bound\nschools it is what in the older paradigm the english stiff-upper-lip military language would have called\n\u201ccharacter training but what it really is  it is\nabout a playground in which no harm is going to come to anyone but\nthere is the opportunity for people to learn what they really\ncan do i used to work with delinquent kids\nwho used to go abseiling and rappelling off cliffs and we used to go\ninto the mountains and camp out and they had transformational\nexperiences because they never realized that they could do any of\nthis stuff people can do anything people can do so much more than they are permitted to know richard branson who many people will\nknow as the founder of virgin which is quite a huge financial business empire in britain and i am not actually advocating doing this but one\nof the things that got him on his way was when he was a little tiny\nkid his mother rather than saying to him get\ndown off that tree right now would say go higher go\nhigher you can go higher bet you cannot reach that branch go\nright up to the top of that tree and little richard would climb up and\nhe was quite frightened he would go right up to the top of this tree\nand his mother would say that is\nwonderful you are such a brave boy you can do things that no\none else can do you are great you are the best kid in the whole\nworld now he is a\nbillionaire his mother \u2013 and this is the\nkind of thing that people get locked up for now \u2013 would take\nthis little kid drop him off in a different neighborhood and say now let us see if you can find your way home and\nlittle richard would wander around the streets and have no idea what\nwas happening knock on a door saying i am\nlost okay and then the person would\ntake this little richard back home to where he came from and then his\nmother would say that is\nwonderful you solved the problem you did so well you are so great you can do anything and\nhe is a billionaire and that is because his mother was so\ncrazy she trained him well did not\nshe yes absolutely but most mothers\nnow tell their children do not\ngo out the front door because something terrible is going to happen\nto you do not talk to that stranger because they are going\nto do something terrible to you do not take any risks i have a friend of mine in england he is somebody that used to be my climbing partner because i have\ndone a lot of rock climbing in my life his name is paul he is\na wonderful man a lot of people sign off their letters saying \u201ctake\ncare he signs off his letters saying \u201ctake risks i love it is not that great we should\nbe told life is a risk life\nis everything you do is a risk when you catch the bus or you\ntake your car to go out to where you are going it is a\nrisk when you get in a plane to go back to holland it is a\nrisk when you commit yourself to your\nhusband to your partner richard it is a risk by publishing\nthis video it is a risk life is risky you are never\ngoing to get out of it alive yes you are never going to get\nout of life alive life\u2019s a risk so enjoy it just give me a bit of a\nbackground again on project camelot and how you got started what\ninspired you to go on this journey mm right the reason for the pause there is i am thinking about what level\nto go into this take as long as you like using whatever language you might\nchoose i am a wanderer i am a volunteer this is what i came here to do i am pretty certain and just as many people watching this\nvideo and you yourself will recognize that when you finally think okay now i have arrived\nat something which i really want to do you look back on your life and you realize that all of the\nexperiences you had even ones that were not particularly\npleasant at the time were all part of the training program which you\nchose in your plans like that is why i did this that is why i did this this is why i experienced that this is\nwhy i spent the two years with this terrible person this is why i\nspent a year and a half in this terrible job this is why i chose\nthis terrible parent or whatever because it made me who i am today\nthat helps me now with this resource base i have got to do this\njob now at the time we do not understand\nwhat is happening we think oh\npoor me why am i doing this it is all part of the plan now i recognize that so much of what i\nexperienced has actually led me to this point i spent the first\neight years of my life in africa i worked in the outward bound\nschools i was a leadership and a team-building trainer my mother\nwas a writer who coached me in writing and presentation skills she\nwas an author she always used to say i should write a book i\nhave not done that yet but there is a book in here waiting\nto come you bet there is it is just a matter of time in my management consultancy career i\nlearnt how to handle executives how to handle people in authority how to handle meetings in large corporations how to present you\nknow it is like all of this suddenly comes into play and so i have arrived at the point\nwhere this is just a wonderful playground where i can start to deploy\nall of these skills and abilities at the time i just thought i was\nbeing a human being trying to make it all work but this is what it\nwas all about now i had an abduction experience 20\nyears ago which it in itself is a very long story and i do not\nunderstand all of that story and many people who have had\nabduction contactee experiences do not understand their stories\neither rather than feeling that oh\nmy god something terrible happened to me and these guys were abusing\nme when they carried me out of my tent in the himalayas at 7,000\nmeters in december i was\nabducted out of my tent this was not a military operation i was\nfloated over the glacier in the middle of the night in when the\ntemperature was about minus 14 minus 15 were you conscious when this\nhappened did you see it yes but i could not move i\nwas paralyzed it is a standard abduction experience in a rather\nunusual place it is a very very complicated\nstory about time and i still do not understand the ins and outs\nof it but i am as sure as i can be that what was happening then\nwas this was part of a set-up it was part of a set-up for what i am\ndoing now it is like i do not know what they were\ndoing it was probably a software upgrade there is probably a\nsoftware upgrade of some kind i think that some of the abductions\nthat take place are probably hardware or software upgrades i cannot\nprove it it is just my own silly idea but that is how i\nhave resolved that situation temporarily for myself at that time i had a girlfriend\ncalled angie who that was a very very strange story and i had a\nnumber of strange experiences which led me to conclude that she was\nnot fully human in the accepted sense of the word now i do not\neven know what i mean by that but there was certainly something\ninside her that was not human was this the one that grew like\ntwo feet overnight she grew two-and-a-half inches\novernight \u2013 not two feet oh right two-and-a-half inches and i\ndo not know whether it was overnight or not but it was\ncertainly within two weeks i mean you know it is one of these\nthings that is medically impossible and every now and then she used to say\nto me things that seemed to come from somewhere else they did not\nseem to come from this little 26-year-old girl doing an ordinary job who looked walking down the street like any other 26-year-old girl every now and then she would say something that came from a\ncompletely\ndifferent place and one of the things that i remember\nthat she said to me over breakfast one morning it is like we\nhad the coffee and the toast on the table and then she suddenly\nlooked up at me and she said the\nearth is a very beautiful place and it will not always be this\nway it is like what and then she kind of flipped back into her 26-year-old little girl\nmode and she did not even acknowledge that she had said it you\nknow she would say things like that she\nwould say to me you are\na very special person we will not always be together but i will\nalways love you and she\nwould say this to me over and over again she had say you are\nvery special you are very special at first i thought she was just being\nnice now i think she was trying to tell me that i am very\nspecial in some way now i am not saying that i am the\nonly person who is very special there are tens of thousands of\npeople who are very very special when she walked out on me she said my purpose in your life is\ncomplete how did you deal with that i could not i could not\ndeal with it at all i was devastated i had no frame of reference\nwith which i understood that at all only later did i realize that her\npresence in my life was part of this preparation at the time i had a\nvery deep sense that i was involved in something important and i had\nno clue what it was i thought my\ngod i have been chosen for something why am i experiencing this\nwith this girl why is she in my life i had another similar experience with\nmy best friend at the time who i went on the mountaineering trip with\nin nepal where i was abducted out of my tent he was one of these\nguys as well it is just it is ridiculous he would say things to me i remember\nonce when i was being silly about something i cannot even\nremember what it was he talked to me i mean he was my best buddy i used to in the days when i used go down to the pub i had go\ndown to the pub with him i used to go climbing with him he was a\nwonderful man his name was dave he talked to me and his voice changed he said you are way out of\nbalance he said i\ndo not know where these words are coming from but you are way\nout of balance i mean this is my friend he never said anything like that before or since i mean he was right my life was way out of balance at that time and i was being coached alex collier in his presentation in\nlos angeles when he came out of retirement \u2013 i hope not\ntemporarily \u2013 and he came to speak very very powerful\npresentation indeed he is another very spiritual\nman he introduced the idea just as like an open question to anyone\nwho was listening at that time was would\nyou be open to being mentored by an extraterrestrial race and some people ask us somebody asked\nme just yesterday where are\nthe benevolent ets where are they we are surrounded by these\nreptilians where are the good guys you know come on out we need\nyour help well maybe they are mentors\nsitting there right here and now waiting for us to wake up to the\nfact like maybe all we have got to do is ask we are not asking from\nthe point of view i am\nso small i am a pathetic human i cannot understand\nthings it is like okay we have got an agreement i recognize that i am open to\nlearning i would like to wake up in the morning with a very clear\nsense of something which i am confused about it is not like an intention but\nit is just like this\nis where i want to now some people talk about asking their higher self the same\nquestion and that is another very very viable technique ruth\nand i talk about this all the time we say okay what does our higher self say our higher self can often come up with\nsome very good information but we are also able to ask our\nfriends we have a mutual friend maybe we cannot mention his\nname without permission but he reverts to his guides all the time it was his guides who suggested to him very strongly that you should\nlook in the engine of your vehicle after it had been interfered with lo and behold he was right where did that information come from somebody watching there somebody\nlooking at the whole thing they are going hey we can tell you something if you are willing to open up and\nlisten to us there are non-physical beings or\nbeings that may be physical from their viewpoint but non-physical\nfrom our viewpoint because we are talking about over-lapping\nrealities and dimensions i saw a being in my bedroom 20 years\nago when all this stuff was happening with angie it appeared like a\nkind of hologram it was kind of phasing in and out of reality it\nwas real it was very real now i am sure for him he was solid but i saw him like a kind of hologram he kind of appeared looked\npretty physical looked at me there for about five seconds then\nfaded out again jake simpson our insider contact who\nwe have got on project camelot said that the military of some\ncountries have mastered this technology \u2013 because it is\njust technology \u2013 and they can walk through walls their\nsuper-soldiers can walk through walls he referred to it as a phase-shift you shift the phase i do not know what this means you shift\nthe phase of these electron clouds quantum probabilities and empty\nspace that we call matter such that they just move through each\nother why not the only reason why two\nthings hit each other and bounce off is because you have got the\napparency of a force through the various electromagnetic reactions\nthat are at a quantum level i am not saying this technically\naccurately you have got the strong nuclear\nforce the weak nuclear force you have electromagnetism and\nyou have got gravity \u2013 these are the four basic forces as\nbest as i remember it and the combination of these things results in\nthe apparency of things being solid and the fact that i cannot\nput this hand through this wall i have spoken with somebody who was at\na party where there were some people who seemed to be\nilluminati-connected illuminati basically they are black\nmagicians among many other things they can do all kinds of stuff and ultimately because everything is a solid expression of thought\nor spirituality whatever words you want to use we can actually\ntranscend this stuff without using high technology and so he watched a demonstration by\nsomebody who put his hand through the wall like wwwhhht like a special effect in a\nmovie straight in straight out and people can bi-locate people\ncan levitate if you read that wonderful book which\ni read many years ago that david icke referenced in his presentation michael talbot\u2019s the\nholographic universe there\u2019re a couple of chapters in there about miracles in the\npast david icke talks about fire-walking there are many many documented instances of people in a state of\nreligious ecstasy which basically is in a trance state some kind of\nan altered state where red-hot branding-irons do not touch\ntheir skin they have got big hooks in them and then the hooks\nare taken out of their body and then suddenly there is no\nwounds anymore in the modern day we have got\nthese psychic surgeons in the philippines who can reach inside\nsomeone\u2019s body take out a tumor remove it again and then the\nbody just heals over that is it and then he is got the\ntumor in a jar no anesthetic no nothing he just reaches in and\npulls it out these are\nfilipino psychic surgeons lyall watson in his books supernature\nand lifetide talks about this quite a lot there are a whole bunch of them in the\nphilippines wow there are about last i heard about 20 of them there is a guy in brazil whose name i\nbelieve translates as \u201cjohn of god he handles\nsomething like up to 3,000 patients a day they come in a long line they are about ten seconds each he says okay you need this you need this you need this and sometimes he picks up a rusty\nrazor blade opens them up with this rusty razor blade no\nanesthetic no nothing he just says right okay makes slicing\nsound pulls something out and that is it okay right next and then\nthere is no wound there is no nothing and they are\nfine that is incredible and his name is \u201cjohn of\ngod i had love to go and see him i mean he is on\nthe internet you can check him out you can go on tours you can go\nand see him and then you can be one of those 3,000 people and if\nyou get the rusty razor blade treatment make sure you have got\nyour camera so all of that is testimony to\nthe fact that as michael talbot would put it we are living in a\nholographic universe yes and we got into talking about\nthis because i was talking about my friend who told me about the\nparty that he went to with these strange illuminati characters where\nhe put his hands through the wall and before that we were talking\nabout this being that was in my room who materialized and before\nthat we were talking about seeking help from our etheric friends who\nare also in this non-physical world but all of this if you see it all as\na star trek\nholodeck where you have got all of these different things and\nwhatever you see depends on what as david icke would say it again what radio station you are tuning into all of these are\nmetaphors you have to kind of grok\nthis you know these concepts you realize that there is so much\nroom for anything to happen in life that you want to miracles become\npossible there is no such thing as coincidence one can plan one\u2019s\nown life you can meet who you need to meet and if you want to apply\nthis on a physical level you can step in a jump-room and you can end\nup on mars because it is just another application of practical\nmagic there is nothing really going on\nanyway it is just a dream why do not you make it a lucid\ndream and then you can do anything you want to some people do that the tibetan mystics \u2013 and i\nspent hundreds of years hanging out with them and i used to be one i think at some point \u2013 had these sorts of abilities they can\ndo all kinds of stuff over there it is never really been\nexported into the western world in the west we are very\ntechnology-dependent we exist in a very very controlled way we are\nlied to controlled manipulated from the moment that we are\nborn and we think that we are the most advanced race on earth and actually we are really the most primitive this is where i have my difference and this is a leap here i love the way that richard dolan in his\npresentation at the los angeles camelot conference and in other\npresentations he is made he argues the point very very\ncogently that just because a civilization is technologically\nadvanced it does not mean that it knows what is going on it does not mean it is spiritually advanced it does not\nmean that it is going to have grown beyond the point of being\nbenevolent and he uses this wonderful example\nthat just supposing we now had a time machine we could go back just\na thousand years and talk to some of the people in the year 1000\na.d and you could bring your camera with you you could bring your\nlaptop with you you could maybe bring your car with you you could\nbring your cell phone with you they would see all of this incredible\ntechnology that to them would be like magic they would say you\nare such advanced beings you must have solved every problem in\nwherever it is that you come from you must all be benevolent you\nmust all be like angels you must have handled the\nproblems of war poverty and disease because look at this technology\nthat you have got the logic does not work the\nlogic does not work just because you have got fancy toys\nthat do things that seem like magic it does not mean that we are\nat an advanced level of spiritual ability it just means you have\ngot fancy toys and some of the ets are like that that is what is wrong with\nthis hypothesis that says that just because they are flying\nabout they are using things that do not seem to be rocket\nships and seem to access to other dimensions and they can do fancy\nstuff with all of their toys it does not mean that they are\nadvanced beings spiritually it does not mean that they are\nbenevolent it does not mean that they are friendly it\ndoes not mean that they do not have their own problems it just means that they are\nbeings operating in this universe playing games like we all are they\nhave their own karma they have their own past they have their own\nagendas they have their own purposes they may be doing things with\nus to us that we cannot even imagine and it is very very\ndangerous to make the assumption that they are all wise and all\nbenevolent they may not be i just wanted to slip that in because\nit is so important given that we are talking about\ntechnology i see well on that vein i\nwant to get into talking about extraterrestrial beings either on or\noff earth what is actually going on who is running this planet and\n when are they going to come out and let us know they are\nhere ah there\u2019re a couple of\nsimple questions for you yes i do not know there\nseems to be a move towards something let us just build this up\nslowly larry king on his show larry\nking live has had more\npeople on his interview show talking about ufos and extraterrestrials\nthis year than he has ever had before why interesting last year the head vatican\nastronomer his name i cannot remember made a public statement\n\u2013 this is my paraphrase \u2013 saying that if\nextraterrestrials exist we must remember that they are all our\nbrothers and sisters under god so\nthat came right out of the blue where did that come from or why did\nhe say that last week approximately if i\nremember rightly the same guy held a five-day conference all about\nthe possibility of the reality of extraterrestrial life another interesting thing that is\nhappened is that nasa has announced that there is water on the moon\nas a result of the lcross space probe crashing-into-the-moon\nexperiment that they did richard hoagland who we know he is\nan interesting guy with interesting theories he is no fool we\nlike him he is a smart guy he makes a lot of interesting\ncontributions to these debates he predicted on coast to coast that\nthe next step in this chess game was that they would announce that\nthere is water on the moon because that is one of the\nthings that it is like introducing these ideas it is\nlike oh there is\nwater on the moon okay now most people realize that\nwhere there is water there could be life next thing they will\nfind something else so it is coming clay and shawn pickering who are two\nnew york-based researchers and what they told us is not new to\nthe extent that it has not been reported before michael salla has\nreported this story it is been reported on the open minds\nforum it created a little bit of a stir\nabout 18 months ago when they reported that they had been\ncontacted by a us navy source who disclosed the reality of meetings\nin the united nations of one meeting at the united nations behind\nclosed doors that was disguised as something else but was really\na meeting about preparing internationally for the disclosure of the\nextraterrestrial reality and after that it went to a number of other\nvenues in various places based upon the principle that if there\nis to be disclosure to the world\u2019s population the americans\nhave got to be in agreement with the russians and the chinese and the\ngermans and the french and the brits and the south africans and the\naustralians and everyone else about how they are going to play\nthis story out if you take south africa if the american president makes a\nstatement then the next thing that will happen is that the south\nafrican president will be asked the same question by the south\nafrican press saying what\ndo you know about this he is\ngot to give the same answer otherwise you have got a real\nproblem because you have got people giving different accounts what account to give and what to say and how to say it apparently is being discussed at very high levels\nand has been for at least 18 months and probably for much much\nlonger than that when clay and shawn pickering\ncontacted us  this is all on the project camelot site  they\nreferenced our interview with stephen greer we have had a lot of\ninteresting feedback about that some people really did not like\nit it is like how\ncould you challenge this guy how could you be so belligerent how\ncould you disagree with him so strongly when it is just meant to\nbe an interview they say clay and shawn pickering said this\nis the best interview you have ever done because the level of\npassion and disagreement and intelligent debate and heated\nintelligent debate mirrors exactly what is the reality behind closed\ndoors at the highest level of policy they said this\nis completely representative of the angst and the disagreement and\nthe concern that there is among good people at the highest levels of\npolicy they do not have the answers to\nthese questions either they do not know who they can trust they do not know what to say they do not know what it\nmeans if somebody comes along saying i am\nan et  here\u2019s some technology and we are giving it to\nyou because we like you now of course i am saying that\nin a sort of playful way but how can we understand and how can we be\nsure of the agendas of these beings some of them will be genuinely\nfriendly and others may not be it is very very important to\nmake the right decisions about these and it is very very\nimportant to give people the right information i think that whoever\nit is who is pushing for this disclosure \u2013 and it is\ncoming i believe something\u2019s coming we do not know when\nand we do not know what and we do not know how much truth\nit is going to contain pete peterson when we spoke to him at\nthe end of june of this year told us that he had been told by his\nown source now let me back up a little bit here because\nthis has become an internet rumor that is kind of gone wild i will just repeat again exactly\nwhat he said he said that he had been told by a source of his that\ntelevision time had been booked for the 27th of november across many\nnetworks in which obama was planning to make an announcement after\nthen immediately after that he said just\nbecause it is planned does not mean it is going to\nhappen we spoke to him a\nshort while ago and he said he had give it 50/50 that is\njust his personal guess this is the information that david\nwilcock was referring to when he went out on quite a long thin limb\non coast to coast now we love david he is a good friend of\nours he may know things that we do not know but based upon\nwhat we were all told by pete peterson at the same time i would not\nhave said something quite so strongly as david did the problem is with making a\nprediction like that is  like blossom goodchild last year  you\nget to look a little bit silly if you are wrong so i want to\npresent this with every caveat\ni can think of that who knows whether it is going to happen the\n27th of november it looks like if they were going to\nmake a run-up to this they should be saying a little bit more than\njust they found water on the moon it sounds like there are several other\nintermediate steps before they say something clay and shawn\npickering tells us that the heated debates behind closed doors are\nstill going on and they are not close to being resolved yet my personal feeling and i do want to\nsay this on record is that we are not going to hear anything on\nnovember 27th i had love to be wrong but i think it is too\nearly i think that may have been hopeful it may well have been booked but who\nknows what other provisional bookings they have made for the\ncoming months we just do not have that information pete\npeterson does not know either he was just reporting what he was\ntold it is coming we do not know\nwhen we do not know what we are being told and some\npeople in the disclosure movement think right our long battle for 30,40 50 years ever since roswell is going to\nbe over as soon the president or whoever it is makes his announcement\nto the white house press corps and i would say well\nactually that is where it might just begin because we do not know what they are going to say we do not\nknow how some of those questions are going to be fielded we do not\nknow what happens after that there may be a whole new game on in\nterms of oh my god they have\ntold us this and we know that that is not true now everyone in the world is\nbelieving that good comes from the president\u2019s mouth so now\nwe are doing a new level of problems to deal with in terms of\nwhat is true what is not true what is been reported what do people believe how is this making people react and why they\nare doing all of this you have to see this whole thing as a\nchess game and a chess game can be played out in many different\nways it could be a distraction to give people something to get\nfascinated with for several months while this all comes out while\nmeanwhile they are doing their micro-chipping quietly on the\nother i mean it would be a wonderful way\nto take the heat off the swine flu debate by suddenly announcing that\nets are real all of a sudden this thing about whether or not\nchildren should get vaccinated starts to feel not very interesting it is much more interesting and sexy to talk about this other\nstuff they could be doing it now there are so many things happening at\nonce at the moment the 2012\nmovie was released just a few days ago i have not seen it yet i am told it is not very good but it is very\nspectacular but they have released that for a reason and there\nis definitely is a plan to drive us into fear because fear makes us\neasier to control one has to think the way they think these people are very clever everything that happens is for a\nreason there may be a whole bunch of misdirects going on that are\ncausing us to feel and think and worry about and maybe react against\nthis thing over here and something very quietly is happening over\nthere we need to be smart enough to try and anticipate what these\ngames are once again i use the word \u201cgame advisably\nbecause we have to see it that way when our interview with deagle the\none that we did last night is published \u2013 and i hope to do\nthat this afternoon because it is very very important stuff \u2013\nhe presents a different scenario for what we might be experiencing not just up to 2012 but up to maybe as late as 2019 he does not\nthink at all that things are suddenly going to go pear-shaped in\ndecember 2012 he is a very smart man is\ndeagle he is sure that patrick geryl and cliff high have got\nthis all wrong he says that there is likely to be some very intense\nsolar activity that is going to result in physical effects on\nthis planet and that there will be a crustal displacement it is a very interesting theory this \u2013 not a pole shift  but the earth\u2019s crust is like\nthe skin that is formed on hot milk it is sort of looks\nlike its solid but actually it can move around it does not\nbreak up but it can break up and it kind of floats about on this\nviscous surface which actually is the hot magma underneath the\ncrust he says that his calculations and\ninsider sources indicate that over a period of time what is likely\nto happen is that there will be a gradual crustal displacement that\nwill happen at about walking pace that will happen over a period of\nseveral months geologically that is very very\nfast but it does not make for a good disaster movie because the\ncontinents will start to rearrange themselves at the rate of about\ntwo kilometers an hour a walking pace something like that but after three months everything is\ngoing to be in a slightly different place and then the weather\u2019s\ngoing to change and then the ice caps are going to melt and then\nthe sea level\u2019s going to rearrange itself he says that japan\nis probably going to disappear and all kinds of things that are\npretty heavy duty but the world\u2019s not going to end it is\ngoing to result in problems in the food distribution there is likely to be corona mass\nejections which will influence and affect anything that operates\nelectromagnetically we have had insider information\nourselves at camelot we heard back in april  from the wife of\nan electrical engineer who had suddenly been briefed that he had\nabout three or four years to handle the problem of every transformer\nin the british national grid burning out we corresponded with the wife of this\nguy there were several emails over a three- or four-day period\nbecause this guy was away and she said look i cannot answer your questions because i am not a scientist\nand i will put them to him as soon as he returns home and we heard nothing else at all\nbecause presumably \u2013 we can only assume and it felt absolutely\nreal \u2013 we could only assume that this guy got home and said what the hell are you doing we cannot talk to\nanyone about this it would be too dangerous and i have been\nthreatened you cannot do this please you should not have\ntalked to these people and then we have heard from other\npeople with very very similar things bill deagle confirms this there are electrical engineers all over the world working in the\npublic domain who have already been briefed that they need to\ntake care of stuff that might possibly happen and the population reduction plans this is such a big subject it is very hard to go at it\nin a linear way the population reductions plans are basically see the obvious question is look if you are going to have significant earth changes and a\nbreakdown in the infrastructure and a breakdown in food production and all of this which are going to be life-threatening of\nlife-ending for a lot of people why are they worried about reducing\nthe world\u2019s population at the same time through artificial\nmeans as they are deagle\u2019s response to this basically is that it is a matter of timing they are\ntrying to anticipate when these things will happen they need to have\nthe world\u2019s population reduced by the time\nthat these things really kick in because otherwise their own survival\nmay be threatened by too many people running around doing\nunpredictable things but before that they do not want\nto wipe people out too quickly which is one of the reasons why they\nmay not have done it until now because they want to keep up the\nmanufacturing base which they are dependent on because the\ngadgets which they use to keep them alive in their underground\nbases somebody\u2019s making these things they are not\nmaking them in their own factories you and i are making these\nthings metaphorically speaking so the people in the factories all\nover the world need to be able to keep up their production and so\nit is a matter of keeping things going for as long as possible\nand then just before the music stops metaphorically speaking then\nthey are going to say okay you guys are not needed anymore now we start to reduce the world\u2019s\npopulation and then the\nearth changes start and then they all go underground and then\nthey have got their plan\nb which is the bases on the\nmoon and mars now all of this deagle says may\nonly start to pan out as late as 2019 he does not buy the 2012\nthing at all and i do not either i suspect that the 2012 thing\nis a big misdirect and the very fact that we have got this\nroland emmerich movie coming out confirms to me that it is more\nlikely to be a misdirect it is like right if he is saying this then something else is going to be\nhappening in the meantime we are all meant to be believing this but there is something going on and we and you and a whole bunch of other people who are watching\nthis movie right now are busy trying to figure this out we are\nnot jumping on the bandwagon to claim that bill deagle is correct\nabout this but he is very very smart he is very very\nwell intentioned he is got his own insider sources and what he\nwas describing \u2013 which very soon after if not before this\nvideo is published we will have that full hour and a half audio on\nour site it is the kind of thing you need to listen to three or\nfour times because it is very very intense \u2013 it rang\ntrue to me it rang true to me it is not a disaster but it is\na big change it happens every 11,500 years and was the same kind of\nthing that we read about in the legends as the legend of atlantis the great flood so on and so forth a whole bunch of stuff happened but it was not a big wipeout it was just a little bit of a\nreset and a little bit of a reorganization and a lot of the high\ntechnology that existed back in those days disappeared and then that correlates of course with what hoagland has been saying all this time which is really really interesting he says all these ruins that are on mars and on\nother rocky moons iapetus one of the moons of is it saturn or\njupiter i cannot remember \u2013 it is got incredible\nstructures on it i mean the whole solar system seems\nto be littered with artifacts of different kinds but he says it is\njust humans having done their thing in previous ages he says it is\nnot ets building this stuff  it is us it is our history he said it is our\nhistory we do not know our own history very very interesting\npieces now of course there are probably et\nbases there as well we heard from \u2018henry deacon arthur\nneumann about the mars base that is occupied or rather jointly occupied by human military or human military intelligence whatever you want to call them but there are other ets there as\nwell there is life and people you know people everywhere but a lot of the stuff out there hoagland claims actually is us from previous ages we have been\nout there and we have left our ruins behind i do not know\nwhether it is true or not it is a fascinating thesis and\ndeagle is not let me put this right deagle is not in disagreement\nabout this we do want to point people towards bill deagle\u2019s\nwork and a lot of people say that he is\na fear-monger and a lot of people say that david icke is a\nfear-monger and actually i introduced david on saturday by saying\nthat he is one of the most positive optimistic courageous\npeople that you could ever think of and he says that the idea that\nthis might all have a bad ending never really occurs to him and\ndeagle is exactly the same but he is not saying and david\nicke is not saying that we are not going to have a tough\ntime we may have a tough time and some people may have to drop\ntheir bodies and pick up another one somewhere but that is not the end of the\ngame and that does not make it all into a disaster movie it\nmakes for quite a lot of drama and quite a lot of change and quite a\nlot of interesting things going on but in the biggest picture after all\nthis there actually is the opportunity for the human race to emerge\ninto what many many psychics have seen as being after all of this\nchaos some kind of a golden age which will emerge and one of the messages that i want to\ngive here is that if this was all going to be a dreadful terrible\nstory i would not be here you see i would not be here i\nknow that i would not be here i would not have come here\nin 1953 to do what i am doing now i would have gone off to\nsome other planet i mean there are all kinds of wonderful\nplaces to be out there where you can really have a lot of fun doing a\nlot of different things i am here because there is a\ngood chance that this game is going to result in a good outcome in\nthe meantime it is fun it is interesting it is a\nlearning experience it is a training course for you and me and\neveryone else too i am really pleased that i volunteered for\nthis but i did not volunteer for a dead end and all the wonderful children who are\ncoming in who they are trying to control with ritalin and all\nthese drugs and all these you know i mean all the indigo\nchildren they are coming in in waves and waves the cavalry is\ncoming they are little kids running around \u2013 the cavalry\nis here we get letters from people we get\ne-mails to project camelot we get more and more letters from younger\nand younger people people who are in their teens people who are in\ntheir early 20s and they have levels of awareness and information\nwhich they are holding in their understanding that i never had\nwhen i was that age when i was 20 even when i was 30 i\nhad not got a clue what was going on i had no idea at all i\nwas trying to figure it all out and these guys are really on the\nball some of them cannot spell very well but that is not\nimportant we have so many people saying i\nknow i am here for a reason i want to find out what i am\nhere for i understand all this information your information has\nhelped to wake me up your information has helped me realize that i am\nhere you know we\nget this from more and more people and younger and younger people and of course we are working as\npart of a huge team you are going to start getting these\nmessages as well if you have not already started to get them yes mm-hm and there are people working all\nover the world in different cultures in different ways and all of\nthis is happening it is a movement it is a movement and all of these young kids they\nwould not be here if this was a dead-end fixed rigged game they had\nhave gone to another table another planet they had be doing\nsomething else they would not be here they are here\nbecause there is a good chance because it is fun because we are working together because they can reconnect with\npeople who they have got an agreement to reconnect with many of us have known each other\nbefore this is why i am sure that since you started doing\nwhat you are doing you have been bumping into people who\nyou have only met for one or two days and you think my\ngod i felt i have known you all my life it happens all the time and the\nreason for that is \u2018cause they are not strangers they are\nold friends you have an agreement it is part of the life-plan\nto meet up and work together because this is what you have done\nmany times before the reason why it is fun to work with people\nis because it was fun last time so here we go again it is like a long series of\nmovies where you get the same characters again faced with a\ndifferent problem and here we go you know and that really is the\nway that it is and so that for me is one of the\nmost important messages of hope that there is that this whole\ncavalry would not be investing themselves here if it was all\nhopeless they are investing themselves here because there is\nsomething really valuable that could come out of this i do not think anything\u2019s\nfixed it is not fixed to have a good outcome it is not\nfixed to have a bad outcome but it is a fascinating game and\nmy message to anyone who is watching this who feels that\nthis that what i am saying is saying\nanything to them is you are probably watching this video right now\nfor a reason nothing happens by accident if you find yourself\nthinking what should i be\ndoing what should i be being even if german is your language and you are fascinated by ruth\u2019s\nbook then that is a good place to start whatever it is that you feel drawn to\ndo at this moment then that could be what it is that you are\nhere to do be smart be careful check things out with people be\naware for all the tricks you possibly can do but follow your\ninstinct if you spend all your time trying to think it out\nlogically you are not going to get anywhere you have got\nto jump off the cliff the angels will catch you because the angels\nare real brilliant that is\nexcellent thank you bill i just want to go back to the question of\nplease tell us about who is actually running this planet is it\nthe reptilians who is it what is\ngoing on okay okay who is running\nthe planet the anunnaki are part of the picture the anunnaki are an\ninteresting bunch of people there is a lot which i do not know\nabout them and these seem to be a good example of what i was talking\nabout a little earlier in this conversation that rather than saying oh my god these are people\nthat we have got to worship or we have got to fight or\nwe have got to propitiate to or we have got to appease or\nwe have got to negotiate with actually maybe they are people who came here with a problem and there is information from\ndifferent sources including some of my own information which feels\nreal \u2013 and i have heard this elsewhere \u2013 is that they\nmay have lost their planet because bad things happen out there it is\na violent universe for any race of beings any advanced\nrace of beings that loses a planet that is a tough problem to\nsolve because it is like somebody losing their house in an\nearthquake and then wandering around wondering where they can live they think oh that is\na nice house and that is a nice house but everyone\u2019s already living in the nice houses you know now this is a very poor analogy you\ncannot just wander into a beautiful empty house all the\nbeautiful planets are already occupied they have already got\npeople or beings who seem to be there now it is possible that \u2013\nand i present this as a hypothesis \u2013 it may be that they are\nworking through their own karmic history as a race just supposing a\nplanet was destroyed then the race had nowhere to go but because\nthey had not been very nice to people before that nobody wants\nto take them on board as refugees then they have got a problem one of the things that clay and sean\npickering said now they do not know anything about the\nanunnaki this is highly compartmentalized i think that at least\nsome of the anunnaki or the people who are called the anunnaki are\nreptilians and remember that the word \u201canunnaki as\ntranslated by sitchin simply means \u201cthose who came from heaven\nto earth it is like a generic term for\nextraterrestrials really visitors they do not call themselves\nthe \u201canunnaki i do not know what they call\nthemselves it is possible that these are\nrefugees looking for a place to squat a place to take over people\nto negotiate with a role to play a place to be \u2013 i do not\nknow if we imagine that there is a\nrace that lost their planet they are likely to be heavily\ntraumatized they are likely to be split into different groups they are likely to have disagreements between themselves about\nwhat they should do some of those beings some of those people might say okay we should\nask for help others might\nsay no we are a\nwarrior race we just go in and invade those people we have no\nrespect for them anyway and besides we like their real estate we have been told that the\nanunnaki have split into a number of different factions and actually\nthey do not necessarily get along well with each other some of\nthem may well be friendly some of them may not be i met barbara lamb who is a therapist\nwho works with contactees she is widely respected she is\na wonderful person i met her in los angeles in february and she\ntold me that a reptilian had materialized in her room physically held her hand for two minutes looked her in the eye and gave her\nthe information that he had been bred as part of a program to\ncommunicate with people chosen people with the message that they\nare not all unfriendly that was his role and barbara lamb\nunderstood this because she is heard all of these stories you know just because somebody\u2019s\neight feet tall with muscles and scales and green i mean i\ndo not know what they look like you know they probably look\npretty frightening but that does not mean to say that they are\nnot nice people as ruth said the bottom line once\nyou disentangle all of this mess that we have got down here at\nthis level of reality everyone is infinite consciousness even a\nnasty reptilian who eats babies they are infinite consciousness\ntoo they have just forgotten who they are just like you and i\nhave maybe and so there is room for\ncompassion in this this is where the infinite love thing fits in see there is room for compassion there is room for\nrealizing that these guys might have a big problem most people who\ndo something that is antisocial or violent or nasty they are\njust trying to solve a problem if somebody holds you up at knifepoint\ndown a dark alley and steals your wallet they are just trying\nto solve a problem if somebody bombs another country they are\njust trying to solve a problem if somebody takes over a planet they are just trying to solve a problem if your partner screams\nat you and throws a plate at you in the kitchen because they are\nupset they are just trying to solve a problem they are just self-medicating by\ndoing something that makes them feel better so any bad thing that\nanyone ever does is just they are trying to solve a problem it is just that usually when these things result in a negative\neffect on somebody else it does not really finally solve the\nproblem it is just very temporary it just feels like they are\nsolving a problem it does not actually end the whole thing this is what karma is karma is trying\nto solve a problem in a way that creates another problem creates\nanother problem creates another problem creates another problem and the whole thing never ends you have got to lift yourself up\nto a higher level to realize how to really handle these problems not\ntry and solve them by react react so so much about that but this is where compassion comes\ninto this that rather than fighting these guys we have got to\nunderstand that they may be here because they are trying to\nsolve a problem and they are trying to solve a problem in a way\nthat might not be good for their karma and might not be good for us\nphysically now you asked me who is running\nthis show it is certainly very real for me that there are\nreptilian entities who are operating behind or operating within senior figures who are influential in this whole chess game that is\nmodern geopolitics and also in the alternative media world as well if you have got reptilians who are\nsmart enough to take over a human body in whatever metaphorical way\nyou can imagine \u2013 they might stand behind them in another\ndimension they might be like what is called a walk-in where they say okay out of\nhere i am taking over this body now\n and they look like a human but who they were before that was\nsomething completely different this can happen at any stage of one\u2019s\nlife you do not have to be born in here that may happen with politicians it\nmay happen with bankers it might happen with industrialists it\nmight happen with ufo researchers in theory if we do not watch\nour backs it could happen to you and me these are the kind of\nthings which if you regard these beings as having the ability and\nthe strategic capability to figure out okay what position should we occupy on this chessboard then they are going to be occupying positions and they are going\nto be occupying people it is absolutely logical that if they\ncould do that they would do that and not only are the bad guys\noccupying positions and occupying people the good guys are occupying\npositions and occupying people who do you think we are now before i was saying how i was in tibet for a long time i think i have\nbeen on this planet for i mean i have not got any\nmemories earlier than about 2,000 years ago but maybe i just came in\na little bit early just to get used to it if i came here to planet\nearth from somewhere else hanging out in tibet to get the hang of it\nis actually a pretty nice place to do one\u2019s induction before\nyou really start to get involved in it i do not know for sure but i\nknow that some people have come straight in here this is their first\nlifetime i have talked to them i had another girlfriend this is a\nstory i have not told publicly i will not give her name because she could easily watch this i had another girlfriend who had\ncome here from the pleiades two lifetimes ago \u2013 not last\nlifetime in other words this lifetime is her second human lifetime the previous lifetime just like us she had a really really tough\ntime she had a very very tough time because if you come here from\nanywhere it is tough this is a tough planet it is\nnot easy to be here especially if you are used to\nother ways of operating other levels of technology other abilities\nthat one might have that you have to give up when you are here\nbecause things do not work that way with human bodies and human\nbrains because the brain is the interface the brain\u2019s got something to do\nwith telepathy even if it is a fundamental spiritual ability hardware and software work together you can have advanced software but if the hardware\u2019s not right the software will not work so that is got something to do with it now this is all part of your question\nabout who is running the planet behind the scenes here there is\nan invisible game going on \u2013 i will not use the word \u201cwar there are good aliens and there are bad aliens and they are\nvery very probably occupying human conditions and playing things\nout and they are probably hunting each other when bob dean said that there are\nhuman-looking aliens walking the halls of the pentagon and some of\nthem are being hunted which is what we were told by our source who\nwe call john robie who is a character in a movie [ed note to\ncatch a thief because we\nlike calling our pseudonyms characters in movies \u2013 he was tony\ndodd who has now passed on he was a very well known british ufo\nresearcher very widely respected a wonderful man i never met him\npersonally he communicated to us quite intensely he said these guys are being hunted down what he never told us specifically \u2013 probably because he never knew \u2013 is is it\nthe good guys who are being hunted down by the bad guys or the bad\nguys who are being hunted down by the good guys you see the bad guys are being hunted\ndown by the good guys or the other way around oh or possibly both you know who\nknows what is going on out there it is just the idea that\nwhen tony dodd reported during our site as john robie and confirmed\nby bob dean saying that there is one race \u2013 this is pretty\nmuch what bob dean said from memory \u2013 he said that there is one\nrace which he has been told about that looks exactly like us you\nwould not notice them if they stepped next to you in the train you had never notice them if you met them at a party you had\nnever notice them if you were working for them or with them or had\nthem working for you or if they applied for a job in military\nintelligence you would not notice they are just human and bridging slightly over that this\nis something that \u2018henry deacon arthur neumann said\nover and over again he said they are\nhumans there\u2019re people out there they are just like us some of them look a little bit different some of them have slightly\ndifferent skin some of them are big some of them are small some of\nthem have got different-shaped eyes but hell we have that on planet\nearth as well why do you think we all look so different it is\nbecause we have got genetic components from all these other\ndifferent races and they are all slightly different but\nfundamentally maybe with the odd exception you know they have\nall got two arms two legs a head two ears two eyes a nose and a\nmouth and a brain that is up here and they have got their\nown chakra system and they have got their own biology but they are pretty much human it seems to be the template for this galaxy at least maybe with one\nor two exceptions and if some of those humans are so similar to us\nthat you could not tell the difference i am sure they are\nhere they are probably very brave volunteers doing their own\nthing and if any one of those is watching this video come contact\nus because we had like to interview you i personally want to interview a\nreptilian if they can speak ahhh yes you had probably\nhave to have an intermediary to pick up their telepathic contact one\nof the things going back to now this whole thing is not\ngoing in a straight line but what clay and shawn pickering told us\nwas that the disclosure program which they have been told about by\ntheir us navy source in great detail concerns two extraterrestrial\nraces they did not know about any of the others they said\nnobody knows what the grays are doing they are doing their own\nthing henry deacon told us that he said we\ndo not know what those guys are doing they are doing their\nown thing quite interesting he [clay and shawn pickering\u2019s\nsource] talked about a reptilian race who are subservient to another\nrace which is a silicon-based life form that is not\nhumanoid that it is got tremendous abilities but is so alien\nin every sense of the word that it is really hard to understand\nwhat it is that they want how they operate anything about them at\nall because it is a totally different paradigm they are just crystals they are\ncrystals basically they are crystals that can apparently move\nand levitate and communicate telepathically and they can change\ntheir shape because just like you had imagine a big clever\ncrystal would it just grows something outside of it which is\nanother part of the crystal i do not know much about this and it is a very wild story and they do not like the\nenvironment of planet earth because it does not suit their\nbodies very well and so this is a novelty in terms of ufo\nresearchers in terms of ufo research and they have had a bit of\na tough time with their story because everyone says oh this is crazy this is nonsense so they do not have many people who are believing them but their source their us navy\nsource is part of a team of six who has been surgically modified which apparently is quite a traumatic process been surgically\nmodified to be able to communicate with these beings and he is\nhad deep interaction with them but one of the reasons why there are\ndebates about whether to trust them \nor not is because they do not answer many questions and they\ndo not reveal many facts but people but everyone just\nfeels wonderful when they are in their presence and they seem to\nbe benevolent but they are also withholding a lot of\ninformation but they are alien how do you figure this out everyone\u2019s still trying to work it\nout nobody knows there is more about this in this big\ninterview a four-hour interview the race that is subservient to\nthem is a reptilian race he said that their source believes that\nthey suffered an extinction level event they lost their planet he\nsays \u2013 this is their source when i say \u201che i am\nreferring to their source we have not met them directly we have\nbeen invited to meet them we have not met them \u2013 he says\nthat the reptilians all they want to do is to walk around all they want to do is to walk around they spend their life in big spaceships they do not have a\nplanet apparently it fits it sort of fits what do they look like he said\nimagine a miniature t-rex big teeth a tail and scales they weigh\n500 kilograms (1,000 pounds two and a half meters tall (eight feet\nhigh they are very very strong they are a warrior race they are highly intelligent they are very ruthless another source of ours has described\nthese beings as imagine the instincts and the ethical level of\nresponsibility of a crocodile but with very high intelligence they\ndo not think the way that humans do once again going back to david icke david icke was saying just a couple of days ago he also was\nreferring to these beings as they in his terminology they operate through mind they operate through a program they will\ndo whatever is expedient they will do whatever is practical they\nwill do whatever is in their own interests and they do not have\nany empathy they do not have any sympathy it sort of fits that behind all of\nthat \u2013 and this is where we go back to what ruth was saying which is absolutely true \u2013 behind all of that you have got\nsome form of cycle of abuse that has made them into what they these are tough kids on the block we have children like that too almost almost some of them you do not want to come near them\non a dark night you had be better off with a crocodile some of\nthem but behind them they have\nexperienced something that has made them into that they have had\na tough time and this is their response they are trying to\nsurvive in the world that they think is unsympathetic to them this\nis just their response they are trying to solve their own\nproblem by being in a certain way maybe these reptilian characters he says\nthat the difference between them and a t-rex is that if you\nremember what a t-rex looks like they have got these little\nvestigial arms these guys have got longer arms with very dexterous\nfingers so they are tool-makers you see if you think of the evolution of a\nbiological species you have got to go through the tool-making\nphase this is why dolphins have not evolved high technology because they cannot make tools they have got no fingers they have got no hands all they can do is make noises and play\ncomplicated games and swim around in the sea they will never be\nan industrial race or an electronic race because you have got\nto go through that phase by making things and they have been through this phase\nof making things they are highly intelligent they are\nhighly able post-industrial they have space flight they have the\nwhole thing and what i do not know is whether\nthese are the same as the anunnaki what we do know about the\nanunnaki and i had a fascinating conversation with david icke\nabout this i keep on talking about david icke because he is a\nreference point that many people watching this video will recognize\nand be familiar with and i had a fascinating conversation with\ndavid i was telling him all that we heard about the reptilians and\nthe anunnaki and he was telling us and it was absolutely matching\ntotally one of the characteristics is that\nwhen they are in contact in physical contact they will not reveal\nwhat they look like they regard their appearance in a ritualistic\nway or a way that has become ritualistic as sacred it is part\nof their custom and ritual and fixed way of operating that you cannot\nlook at their face or that we cannot look or humans cannot\nlook on their face it is not done and \u2018henry deacon arthur neumann who has encountered these characters physically in\nthe flesh \u2013 he never saw their faces because they are all\nwearing cloaks and headdresses and funny stuff like that this is\nwhat they do they are very ceremonial it is an ancient\nculture which has ritual deeply engrained in everything which they\ndo why not they can do anything they like they are aliens and when david icke was describing how\nthe ritual and the status and the sense of axiomatic importance\nthat is ascribed to royalty the divine right of kings and all the rest of it this all comes from the anunnaki this is how\nthey regard themselves and when you meet them it is\nlike meeting a king or like meeting a queen you have got to\ntalk in a certain way you have got to avert your eyes you have\ngot to hold your hands in a certain way you have got to approach\nthem in a certain way you have got to do everything in a certain\nway otherwise our source said i do not think it was a joke he said if you do not\ndo it right you end up on their dinner plate it is like there is\na certain way that you go about all of this you have got to\ndefer to them you have got to you know but what is\nreally really interesting is that if this is the same group as clay\nand shawn pickering are talking about and they describe these guys\nin great detail \u2013 you know you can see them when they are\ndescribing them they describe them vividly \u2013 they are\nsubservient to this silicon-based life form and the hypothesis is\nthat the silicon-based life form rescued them when they destroyed\ntheir planet so somehow they are operating symbiotically everything that i said here raises a\nhuge number of questions and i do not have the answers to them i do not know whether these reptilians are shape-shifters the silicon-based race apparently\nthey can shape-shift but they do not shape-shift physically they affect the perception in the brains or the minds of the people\nwatching so when this guy when this source the first time that he\ncame across one of these things if i remember rightly he was with a\ngroup of people in a room and he was announcing that he was going to\nhave an important meeting and he went to the middle of these\npeople in this room and he was briefed by a senior military officer\nfor five minutes until the military officer then became this big\ncrystal because it was not a military officer at all they\nperceived\na military officer and what was really interesting is\nthat all of those people in that group saw something slightly\ndifferent because this was a mental perception and then they were\ncompletely confused by this they all went off into another room and\ncompared well this is what\ni saw what did you see well he was wearing brown shoes no he\nwas not he was wearing black shoes you know he was two\nmeters tall no he was not he was quite short you know but they  saw a person and\nthe rest of it was something to do with what they were sort of\nexpecting it was an individual response to something that they were\nbeing evoked to see or evoked to sense and hear but they [the\nsilicon life form] can only maintain it for about five minutes then\nthey collapse into their real state which is a physical state the question immediately to their\nsource was well is this\nsome kind of a hologram or an illusion or a and no it is absolutely physical they are a rock they are a\nrock in a suit you know it is a really weird\nthing he said they are\na rock you know he could not so it is a big crystal\nthing it is straight out of some bad science fiction movie it is not what you expect but they have the capacity to\ninfluence how they are perceived for short periods of time fascinating stuff absolutely fascinating and the reptilians if it is the\nsame group of reptilians are subservient to them the silicon-based\ngroups do not seem to hang around on planet earth they are\nout there somewhere and nobody knows where they are\nfrom this is another problem they are not answering the question\nwhere they are from i need to listen to the interview again but i think the response is something like you\nwould not understand which is not very helpful it may be true but it is still\nnot helpful and there may be different branches of\nthe reptilians but the reptilians are a theme they are a theme they are coming up over and over again there are people who have\nencountered them there are people who have been contacted by\nthem there are people who have had experiences like barbara lamb\nhad there are the shape-shifting experiences in our most recent interview with\njordan maxwell bless him he came out saying david\nicke should not be persecuted for what people perceive as being his\n\u201ccrazy ideas he is absolutely right in what he says i have had the same reports they are separate reports and then he told this incredible story\nabout this girl who had been left alone in the house in an american\nmilitary base \u2013 i mean this is straight out of hitchcock or\nsomething worse \u2013 you know looking in the mirror behind there is this reptilian being who steps out of the closet and\nstarts gliding across the carpet towards her and this is a twelve-year-old i\nthink it is a young daughter of an american military officer with\nguards around the house because this guy knew that there was some\nkind of a threat but did not know what the threat was and this\nthing came from a closet left big scratch marks on the door straight out of a bad movie and then disappeared this girl was\ncompletely freaked out and jordan got this story from the girl who\nis now a woman telling this this happened on an american military\nbase these things happen all time they cannot control it just\nstepping into a dimensional portal they can control where they\nappear this is why they appear in cupboards and funny places like\nthis otherwise they had pop in the middle of a cocktail party that does not work so you know or in the middle of a street or in the middle of a shopping mall no they always appear in\ncupboards and things or little corners or basements or you know they can control where they appear when they do appear and the rest of the time they are\nhere manipulating one of the chess pieces on this chess board which\nis a prominent figure whose role it is to influence other people so\nit is a perfect strategy this is why some of them are\npoliticians this is why some of them are industrialists they are\nprobably in the media and they are probably in ufo research if i was a reptilian with an agenda\nlike that that is exactly the pieces that i would occupy it\nmakes perfect sense and it makes for a great movie yes does not it okay tell me are they actually eating\nthe children some people say so in bill\ndeagle\u2019s 2006 granada forum lecture there is a part where\nhe says i could tell you\nwhat they do but i am not going to because i would fall apart bill deagle is a good man he could not talk about what he knew he could not talk\nabout what he knew he was in the middle of a presentation henry deacon arthur\nneumann told us that in his place of work in his classified place\nof work we know where that was he attended a briefing all about\nthis subject and he walked out of the briefing because he could not\nstomach it he told us he was amazed at two things one of them he\nwas amazed at how everyone was just sitting there listening to this\nand taking notes and he was also amazed that nobody stopped him from\nwalking out what did they tell him he was hinting heavily like many\ninsiders who have got something important to say he will talk\nindirectly about it and the way that he alerted us to this story\nwas we were sitting in a restaurant with him talking about all of\nthis stuff we have spent hours and hours and hours and hours\nand hours with him met him on many many occasions and we had\noften meet him for dinner and he was making a reference to a short\nstory a short science fiction story which i read many years ago but\ni cannot remember if it was by philip k dick or if it was by\nheinlein or whoever it was but the title of the story was to\nserve man ed note the\nauthor was damon knight this is the story and it was a little\nbit of a silly short story and most science fiction short stories\nare about 12 pages long and they are quite fun and they have\ngot a little punch line and you have got maybe 20 of them in a\nbook and this story was called to\nserve man and the theme was these aliens had\nappeared and it had been discovered that in some document that\nsomebody had seen with them that there was this document that said to serve man and people were saying oh this is great  they have come here to serve us they have\ncome here to you know to\nhelp us to assist us and\nit actually turned out that what it really meant they were going to\nserve us up on a plate it is actually a very bad play on words and \u2018henry arthur was\nmaking pointed references to this as he looked in the menu of this\nmeal and i did not get it and kerry did not get it we\ndid not really get what he was talking about and he kept on\nmake he was becoming more and more pointed and more and more\npointed until he virtually had to spell it out for us when he\nrealized that we had understood that there were at least some of\nthese aliens who are eating people then he said okay i do not need to talk about that anymore and it seems to be a theme and one of\nthe problems in this whole research area is that \u2013 and it is\nalso the problem with the president of any country going out towards\nthe press and saying oh yeah roswell was real it is like after half an hour or an hour or two hours or two\ndays or two weeks someone then starts asking the question well we have heard about this is this true you see and it goes to unsavory places it goes to places that you\ndo not want to go our research takes us to these places our research takes us to what the illuminati are doing to what is\nhappening to the vatican to what the reptilians are doing to\nextremely nasty places where i never i do not want to go\nto those places it does not feel like fun anymore really when\nyou are looking at all this stuff you think oh god i do not want to deal with this stuff it is not nice but if one is going to be a really really honest researcher you have got to follow the data trail and this is what david icke does this is what bill deagle does it is\nnot what everybody does some people say nah i am not going to go there i am only going to talk about\nnice aliens or i am only going to talk about earth changes  i am not\ngoing to talk about aliens at all or i am only going to\ntalk about what the politicians are doing or what the economy is\ndoing but if you look at it from a high\nenough place you see that all of these things are interconnected even the nasty stuff and this is where again when you go back to\ndavid\u2019s opening statement and ruth\u2019s opening statement if you hold that line that we are infinitely capable infinitely\nwonderful infinitely beautiful spiritual beings and all else is\nillusion drama and play maya then you can handle it it is like oh okay you\nknow it does not feel very nice but\n it is\njust one of those things in a dream that just feels a bit yuck you\nknow and then you move on it is the only real way to handle\nit how you communicate about it to people who do not have that\nviewpoint i do not know do you ever come across\ndisinformationists when you are interviewing people people who\ntry to feed you deliberate disinformation how do you suss them out and how do you vet your witnesses hmm what a question i do not\nbelieve i do not believe \u2013 i am choosing my words\ncarefully here \u2013 i do not believe that there has been very\nmuch deliberate disinformation in any of our interviews and i will qualify that that\ndoes not mean that everything that we are reporting we believe\nis correct some of it has\nto be wrong because you have got people contradicting each\nother you have got dan burisch saying that there are only three\nraces visiting us and clifford stone saying there are 57 and\nprobably more someone\u2019s got to be wrong but they both believe that they are\nright they both really do believe that they are right and one\nthing i want to say here about dan burisch is he believes everything\nthat he is told us he is not lying to us he believes it but that does not mean that it is true as richard hoagland said very\ngraphically in his interview to us and to other people the\nlie is different at every level and why would we believe that disinformation does not also work\non the inside one of the things that they do and i\nlearned this a long time ago is that let me think of an example i am actually going back to the serpo story because this is\nwhere i had some people who first helped me to understand this for\nexample if there is one source who said twelve\npeople went on this mission and then another source on the inside says ten\npeople went on this mission another source says six\npeople went on this mission and these are informal briefings it is actually not very\nimportant it is just a little bit of information then if any of that information leaks\nout they know where it came from if it is the story where six\npeople went on the mission that then leaks out onto the internet then they know that it was the guy who was told that it was six who is\nresponsible for the leak because it went down his channel you see and they do this with documents too if you ask bob and ryan wood from majestic documents they will\ntell you that they do this with documents they deliberately put\nspelling mistakes and typos into official documents and there\u2019ll\nbe different typos and different spelling mistakes in different\ndocuments given to different people so that when they leak they\nknow where it came from so clever so simple you see they do this\non purpose they do this on purpose ed note this process of\ndifferentiating the docs is called \u201csalting the docs it\nis a widespread practice in the intelligence community and so there are different levels of\nthat there are other reasons for disinforming people of course on\nthe inside so that they get confused if someone\u2019s confused they are easier to control they do it with us and they do it\nwith themselves at junior levels there are huge numbers of\ndifferent levels here and the guys at the top are trying to control\nthe people at the bottom and to keep them running around in\ndifferent directions one of the things that bill deagle\ntells and has been saying ever since his 2006 granada forum lecture\nthat he started to get the big picture sorted out because he was a\ndoctor working actually taking care of people physically in many of\nthese classified locations someone\u2019s got to take care of them he was the doctor he was on the inside working there and he would\ntalk to somebody who did not know what was happening in the room\nnext door to him in this classified establishment but the guy who\nwas in the room next door to him had been the previous guy who deagle\nhad seen his previous medical appointment and had told him his\nstory so deagle was getting all of these\ncomponents from all of these people he was talking to  because\neveryone\ntalks to their doctor and so he was able to say to the guy here ah you do not know what is happening in the room next door to\nyou i just spoke to him yesterday this is what he said and so deagle was starting to get the\nbig picture here and this is just a little anecdote about how\ncompartmentalized things are long before camelot in the year 2000\n this is a fascinating story which i have never made public \nlong before camelot i was on holiday in thailand i have been to\nthailand a number of times i have got some friends over there and i met a black ops guy actually there are quite a few of these\nguys who hang out there this is where they go when they are on\nthe run or when they are trying to hide or when they are\ntrying to pretend the rest of the world does not exist this guy had worked for bell labs fascinating story i realized that he was an unusual guy because he\nwas talking to me like an advanced ph.d level physicist i did not\nknow anything about him at all but i finally asked him well where did you go to college what did you used to do and then he said come\nwith me and we walked\nalong the beach and he said i\nnever went to college and i found that almost impossible to\nbelieve he said for\nmy high school science project i was with a couple of other guys and i wish i could remember exactly what he told me he made some\nkind of a vacuum plasma-powered laser gun or something you know this was his high school physics project it is like something\nout of these silly disney movies he was 17 years old he was a kid he made this thing that was a classified \u2018star wars weapon and he made this incredible device the next thing he knew he got a knock on the door\nfrom the nsa saying you are\na smart kid we can take care of you sign here we will give you\nlots of money and we will give you anything you want we will\ntake care of your education he is a 17 year old kid smart\nkid he said yeah sure this is what happened to dan burisch by the way same story almost and so they put him to work in bell\nlabs and they said to him we will\nteach you anything you want you have got a budget of anything\nyou want we want you just to learn stuff get smart and invent\nstuff science kid\u2019s\ndream but what they do with people in bell\nlabs \u2013 this is the point of this story \u2013 he said that\nwhen you are going through to your place of work they put\nspecial goggles on you which blur everything around you so that all\nyou can see is this immediate area around you to make sure that you\ndo not trip over something or bump into a door and so that you\ncan see the doorknob when you are opening it the rest of the stuff you cannot\nsee it is a blur so when you are walking through these\nother offices and laboratories you cannot see what is\ngoing on you cannot see what is written on the wall you\ncannot see who is there you cannot see what they are\ndoing but you can make it through to get to the door and all of\nthese guys have got these goggles on when they are moving until\nthey get to their place and then they take their goggles off and\nthen it is like right  you are in your\nplace and just as dan burisch described in\ns-4 there are lines painted on the floor which you can also see so\nyou go along these corridors like a tram and if you wander off then\nall the bells start ringing because you have got a gadget\nattached to your ankle and the next thing you know you are\nsurrounded by security guards because you have gone off your tram\nlines and if you really go off the tram lines and keep on going off\nthe tram lines they are going to shoot you straight away because they know that something\u2019s badly wrong that kind of\nstuff he told us that this is the\nenvironment they are working in and the reason why he quit because he did not want to work in a place like that you are\nunder total intimidation all the time even though he got to play\nwith antigravity devices and everything else you know after a while\nit was no fun very very interesting story i actually went back there to try and\nfind him and i could not locate him anymore he had gone off\nsomewhere else he had quit he is one of these guys who\nquit because a lot of these black ops guys quit they really\nsuffer there is another story i never told anybody you see if these things come to you if you are doing a job this information comes at you and\nsometimes it comes really early and you do not know what to do\nwith it i was 18 years old hitchhiking in\nnorthern canada this is in northern british columbia it is\nmy first university vacation i was 18 years old and i had a 200-mile\nride with a scientist who talked to me as an anonymous hitchhiker i\nnever knew his name he never knew my name he talked to me he\npoured his heart out for 200 miles because he was doing research\nabout implanting chips in people\u2019s brains this was in 1972 working for the canadian military he was a troubled man he did not\nknow what to do i cannot remember much of it  i\nwas only 18 i was a kid i did not know what was going on i\nthought wow this guy is\ntelling me about all this stuff is he crazy or what and i listened very hard and all i could remember after 200 miles was\nthat he was telling me about the experiments he was being made to do to put chips into peoples brains to control their behavior\n\n\n\n\nmany years later it is like okay now i remember okay now this fits with this and this fits with this this fits\nwith this but these guys\nare troubled you see they are really really troubled what peterson said to us pete\npeterson bless him he is a good man they are all good\nmen who we have spoken to and this is all the context of your\nquestion peterson said that he was talking to us because he did not\nlike the feeling of \u2013 this is an exact quote he\ndid not like the feeling of having to take three baths a day to\navoid the feeling of being covered in excrement once someone gets a little further on\nin their lives petersen\u2019s over 70 now he is a lovely\nman and he is done stuff they have all done stuff that\nthey have to live with jake simpson \u2013 i am sure\nthis is okay to say this he is a wonderful man too he is\na really good friend of ours they do all of this psychological\nprofiling and they pass tests and you know they get to go on\ncertain missions and so on and so forth he said that there was a\nparticular test that he failed which then confined his military\nintelligence history at one point the test that he failed it was\na psychological profiling test it was not an actual test but\nthey determined that he would be unable to kill a child oh my goodness and therefore there were certain\nmissions that he did not go on you know there\u2019re certain\nthings that he was not i mean bless him because he\ncould not kill a child but it means that in this whole world\nthat we are inhabiting of espionage military counter in\nthis whole thing these people who often get they are\ngood people and they go into these programs they do not know they are not told everything at the beginning they do not\nknow what they are being called upon to do henry deacon arthur\nneumann told us you see there is stuff there that he\nhas not told there is stuff there that he cannot talk\nabout because he cannot bring himself to talk about it and we\ndo not know what it is because he is never told us there are mars veterans just like\nthere are vietnam veterans not because there is a fight just\nbecause people they do a tour of duty on mars they spend\nsome time working on a project and they go to mars and come back and go to mars and come back and all of this kind of stuff and then\nthey get moved on to another project maybe it is my term i am\nusing a mars veteran he said that later on after he did\nall this stuff with mars he was working with a guy in a small\nclassified project within noaa the national oceanic and atmospherics\nadministration it is like nasa but it is noaa it is\na public body but they have classified projects too that is\nwhen he told us that he knew about \u201cthe second sun that\nwas coming in he encountered that in noaa they are just\ntracking it i do not know if it is a big problem or not but it is out there somewhere he said he did not really\nknow much about it he said they talked about it sometimes and there was this other guy who\nworked there who by coincidence happened to be a mars veteran he had\nalso done his stuff on mars and \u2018henry arthur said\nthese two men would go into their office they would lock the door and they would weep\ntogether he never told us why he could not say i do not\nknow why i do not know why kerry and i have been guessing for\ntwo years we have no idea we have no idea and it might not matter and we never\npressed \u2018henry on that there are places which he you\nknow you ask him questions and they had bounce off he changes\nthe subject or does not want to respond but anyone who is\nbeen in these programs they have suffered they are suffering\npeople another story that \u2018henry told us he was involved in the 9/11 operation that morning we\npublicized that but it is just a good it is just an\ninteresting story to tell because as an electronics specialist one\nof the jobs that he had was to set up the control system which\nresulted in those two planes being flown into the twin towers \u2013\ncontrol of that model aircraft from thousands of miles away he set\nup the electronics for that he told us all about it but as most people do in these\nprojects he did not know what he was working on he was just\nworking on a control system he did not know what it was going\nto be used for they did not tell him why should they need\nto know but on the morning before all of that\nhappened on the 11th of september he and the people in his place of\nwork were given a briefing and the essence of the briefing was on\ntelevision today you will see a whole bunch of stuff that is\ngoing to be very dramatic but do not worry about it because\nit is just one of our projects and he said one of the things that\nshocked him \u2013 and it is a little bit like that other story\nhe told about this briefing that he went into \u2013 he said the\nthing that amazed him was that everyone else said okay and just went back to work and he was thinking oh my god what are we working on it is going to result in the\ndeaths of thousands of people and the destruction of these two\nbuildings and god knows what and then he had a few hours in which\nhe realized that he had the capability to sabotage it because he was\nworking with the control system he could easily put something in the\nsoftware that would make those planes miss \u2013 and he did not\ndo it and he lives with that he lives with the fact that he could\nhave averted 9/11 he could have had those planes drive into the\nhudson and they did not do it and he has to live with that you and i and everyone else watching\nthis they cannot imagine what it is like being somebody who is\ncarrying that in their soul and that is why they talk you see that is why they talk they talk because they are trying to\npurge their souls they are trying to atone for what they feel\nthey have done and on the inside there is no escape this is why we are protected this is why you may be protected as well or may come to be protected\nas you come and do more and more work because some of these guys there is nothing they can say on the inside they cannot\nspeak out they cannot go and ring up their local newspaper and\nspill their story or call you or call me they cannot do this\nstuff because if they move then that is the end of them or\nthe end of their children or the end of something it is not\nsmart for them to do that so what they do very quietly is they\nwill do something very very indirectly that supports you and me\ncontinuing to do the story they are rooting for us you see they are rooting for us there are a lot of people that are\nrooting for us we know that and we have been told that by a\nnumber of people  the \u201cwhite hats on the inside they are doing everything that they can do to help you and me and a lot of other people out there do our work now then you get the whole chess game\nbeing played because knowing that this is happening then of course\nthis disinformation will come trickling down so i use this just as an example\nbecause it comes to mind after we met with peterson for many many\nhours and he told us a whole bunch of unbelievable things some of\nwhich were not on the video after that we have had a number\nof phone conversations with him and then in some of those phone\nconversations \u2013 i will not go into any detail here at all \u2013\nin some of those phone conversations he said i have\njust heard this from one of my mates i have just heard this from\none of my friends on the inside now we do not know whether to\nbelieve that or not not because he\nis necessarily providing us with any disinformation but because then\nhe becomes a problem to them but at the same time they are\ntrying to i mean one has to think in a military way you\nhave to think like a spook you have to think like you are on\nthe other side of the chess board trying to figure out what to do they know that he is still in\ncontact with us they are not going to shoot him in the head because then that confirms everything he is ever told us so\nthat is the last thing they do but what they do is they see if\nthey can twist it round and then they twist it round by offering him\na little bit of a tidbit of information hoping that he will\nbelieve it and hoping that he will tell us and hoping that\nwe will believe it and hoping that then we say it so then we have to use some kind of a\nfilter and some people going back to the clay and shawn pickering\nstory some people in the ufo community have not touched that because\nthey feel they cannot correlate this information about the\nsilicon-based life form to anything else that they have ever\nheard they are worried that this might be a very complex very\nsubtle very clever disinformation ploy to get people fighting in the\nufo community it happens all the time and they will\nuse credible people they will use people who believe the story because a source who believes what he is saying is going to be\nmuch more valuable than somebody who is been ordered to lie you\nsee somebody who believes what he is\nsaying is going to be really credible and they are going to\nsay well i really believe\nthis information and i have got these documents and i spoke\nwith this person and i also heard this from another person and this\nis what i really think is happening and everything they say is true and they are absolutely credible they look you in the eye you can feel they are good people you\ncan feel they are being honest and you still do not know\nwhether the information is true this is the problem because we\ndo not know the provenance and so what we do i mean all we can\ndo if somebody tells us something we say right how do you know this who told you how sure are you is it single\nsource did you hear this from two different people how long ago did\nyou hear it what happened just before you were told that we are trying to get the lie of\nthe land and what i try and do personally if i can is when i am\nwriting a report i always say i always put little caveats\nin this and i am always wanting like to take every opportunity\nto clarify \u2013 both kerry and i do this that\nthis is what we were told the person who told us we believe that he\nbelieved it maybe it is not true and this loops right back to this\nthing about the 27th of november there are all kinds of caveats\nthere see but the problem is \u2013 and this is the problem that\nwe have in this job that we are doing \u2013 because even\nthough we put the caveats\nthere and peterson put the caveats\nthere and we are thinking well you know i do not know about this but this is what he said and it would be cool if it were true then\nit gets copied and copied and it gets emailed and it gets on\nsomeone else\u2019s blog and then someone else states it on a radio\nshow and so on and so forth and the next thing you know it is\nlike this is what project\ncamelot is saying and then\non the 28th of november we will be liars and we are not we are just\nbeing reporters but we are trying to be reporters with as much\nresponsibility as we can we are not fox news that says we\nreport you decide you\nknow we are not we are not removing ourselves from\nany responsibility here but at the same time we are trying to\nput together what we feel is credible information we can kind of see\npatterns we are trying to say to people we\nthink we see this pattern but maybe you see a different pattern but\nlet us check it all out we are learning all the time we\nknow that some of our information is not correct because it cannot\nbe because we get people contradicting each other we do feel that\nbetween 80 and 90 percent of our information is accurate i used to\nsay 95 percent i think it is probably between 80 and 90 that is\nquite a heavy load of good information we are on the lookout for people\nwho feed us crazy stuff people send us crazy stuff by e-mail all the\ntime that is because it is easy for a kid to write a crazy\nstory and say hey i am\na whistleblower sometimes you can kind of tell\nimmediately you know when somebody says they are a ph.d scientist and they cannot even spell you know then it is\nlike okay there is\nsomething wrong here and at the same time sometimes you\npick up one of these little threads and we do use our intuition for\nwhat it is worth kerry and i both use our intuition when we are\nboth thinking there is\nsomething important here there is something important here then we tend to follow it and then we will invest some of our\ntime in checking it out it is very important not to\nfrontload people meaning if somebody says \u2013 this is an\ninvented story an invented example if somebody wrote to us and\nsays i was at a mars\nbase anyone can say\nthat then rather than saying oh this is what \u2018henry deacon told us is this true you see then the kid in the basement playing the joke says yes it is you see that is\nnot a very good question to ask you have got to ask open\nquestions you have got to say what is\nit like what did you see you\ndo not ask them any questions to confirm anything at all because then all they are going to do is say yes and so on and\nso forth sometimes we come across information\nthat we just do not buy at all and there are some people in the\nresearch community that we just do not we just do not\nbuy their information there is something wrong with it now we may be wrong in some of that\ninformation we may have bought some information that does not\nfit we have got a lot of information about dan burisch for\nexample people say he is\na liar he is crazy you know he is this he is that he is not a liar and he is\nnot crazy his information is not all correct i am certain\nabout that but he is a good-hearted guy he is heavily controlled he is now been turned against us and that is because we trod on someone\u2019s toes after the\nzurich conference we do not know what we did to tread on those\ntoes but dan burisch is now corralled by a bunch of people who\nregard us as some kind of an enemy and we are not an enemy we will\ncontinue to present his information with as much intellectual honesty\nas we can do it is a tough battlefield you\nwin friends you lose friends you become disconnected from people but we do think that we know who is good-hearted and who is\nnot good-hearted we think we can kind of tell that probably as you\ncan and one of the things we were told and this makes our lives more difficult but this is one of the\nthings that also keeps us alive we were told by a very friendly\ninsider source he said listen he said do not\ntry and prove anything never try and prove anything and actually at that time it just\ndid not seem because we were not trying to prove\nanything anyway we do not have any documents we do not\nhave an alien in the cupboard that we can wheel out in front of the\ncamera saying here look at\nthis we do not have\nanything like that we do not have convincing photographs we\ndo not have affidavits from anybody we do not have\nanything all we have is stories and we are\ntrying to paint a picture we are trying to put this mosaic\ntogether so people can see for themselves so that people can use\nthis to correlate their own experience but there is a very subtle point\nhere because some people say you\ncannot prove anything you are saying you are coming\nup with all this stuff and there is not one document not one\nphotograph not one affidavit nothing you cannot prove a\nthing and besides the fact that we do not\nhave\nthat stuff we are not withholding it or anything but this is\nthe fuse in the circuit that enables us to continue to work actually it was hal puthoff dr hal\nputhoff the very famous physicist and the guy who ran the remote\nviewing program at sri \u2013 i regard him as a friend i met him\nfor a couple of days a wonderful man and he was the first person\nwho said he said look it is very important it is important for the authorities\nto maintain plausible deniability he said they want\nthis information to come out but it is got a built-in\nshock-absorber in the system that they want\nall these stories about ets and these stories about abductions and\nthese stories about military hardware and these stories about what is they want\nthis stuff to be slowly percolating into the popular culture but\nwithout any proof at all because this means that the people\nwhose reality would be threatened seriously if there was a\nphotograph of an alien or a conclusive document with kennedy\u2019s\nsignature saying i was\ngoing to do this signed date the day before he was killed or something then you get people\nreacting to this in shock jumping out of windows civil unrest effect on the economy blah blah blah destabilizing governments because suddenly you have got this stuff in people\u2019s face and they know and you get and the religious question for\ngod\u2019s sake as it were so the plausible deniability is in\nthere all the time because no one is being forced to take anything\nonboard if they cannot handle it if they cannot handle it they just say this person\u2019s\ncrazy bill ryan\u2019s crazy mel\u2019s crazy alex jones\nis crazy david icke\u2019s crazy that is their shock-absorber and then they go and live their\nlives and the world continues in a stable say but the people who can take it on\nboard do and they say you\nknow what i feel this is true i do not need any proof i am\njust going to think about this now and it fits with what i heard\nfrom this other guy and this is why it is important and workable and it is all working on a drip feed we are\nactually not only protected by the \u201cwhite hats but\nwe are useful to the \u201cblack hats because they have\ngot a problem they have got a problem because\nthey are sitting on all this stuff it is got to come out somehow they have had a program in place for decades now where\nthey are seeding this information to the popular culture as\nearly as 1952 or whenever it was when they made the first version of\nthe day the earth stood\nstill they were trying to tell the world\nthen something about what is really going on ever since then we have had i mean it is like any kid any teenager\nwho watches movies you ask them if ets are real and they will\nlook at you like you are crazy of course they are real it is obvious they have been watching cartoons about it\never since they were four years old for them it is part of\ntheir reality they think people who think that it cannot be\nreal are crazy you see so it is working and this is in the\npopular culture they have been seeding all this stuff in there we are very very useful to them we are useful to them because we are helping this process we were never part of the plan but that does not mean to say\nthat they are not opportunistically pleased that we suddenly\nappeared on the scene we have not been manipulated into doing\nthis but it is part of how this all\ngoes together if this does solve their problem so that the world is\nable to take upon disclosure and we are somehow part of their\nstrategy because somebody really does want to make an announcement\nthat tells the truth i am actually pleased to be part of that we are not knowingly being used but if it is the truth it is the truth and so let us do that and in the meantime of course they are reading our emails they are probably listening to\nthis conversation they are going to watch this video and\nthey are going to analyze what i know they are going to\nfigure out what it is that i am saying what it is that i am\nnot saying someone\u2019s going to do an assessment to see whether\ni am being responsible they are continuing to update my\nprofile they are going to find out whether i am reliable they are going to see what else they are going to throw at\nme that i might or us you know when i say \u201cme i am only talking about me because kerry\u2019s not here they do this with us all the time and\nto the degree that we are useful to them we are going to\nbe allowed to continue i think we are doing them a big favor they are interested to know who\nwe are talking to they read all our e-mails they figure out\nwho is waking up but you cannot avoid that you cannot\navoid that the only way to avoid that completely is to go into a\nhole stop communicating and go and do something else all your life and that is not the plan either you see we have to work with\nthem so it is a kind of symbiosis you\nsee it is a symbiosis it is a sort of ecosystem where\nall of these you know where you have got the sharks and the\nmice and the elephants and the lions and the tigers and the snakes \nthey all live together in this ecosystem and that is kind of\nwhat is happening on planet earth at the moment now this is a\nreal metaphor but that ecosystem is kind of evolving in a particular\ndirection in the meantime everything\u2019s\nkind of finding its own level the energy\u2019s flowing the\ninformation is flowing and you get this whole thing played out on\nthis huge cosmic tapestry which has got something to do with\nconsciousness increasing the consciousness needs to have information\nso that it is got something to process so people can de-confuse\nthemselves the kids who are coming into this\nworld think what the hell\u2019s\ngoing on ah now i know why i am here now i know what the game\nis now i know where these chess pieces are now i know what to trust\nand what not to trust and everyone\u2019s figuring this\nout and that is all part of the learning because that is\nall part of their responsibility individual responsibility to\nutilize this training course and to learn what they can learn and all of this is against the\nbackdrop of a whole bunch of nasty people who may or may not have\nlost their planet an awful long time ago who are trying to control\nus because they are frightened of the power that we have as\ninfinite consciousness and as they say the guy who said this at the\nbeginning of the third bourne\nmovie you could not\nmake this stuff up it is\nwonderful what a and it is like david icke says i\nwould not be anywhere else doing anything else at any other\ntime it is a\nfantastic time to be alive and it is just the place to be this\nis where the action is we are on the cutting edge and for anyone watching this that is\nwondering whether this is the right place to be i defy you to think\nof anything else anywhere else that was not quite so much fun\nas right now and the opportunity is to really make a difference lovely all right on that note bill thank you very much for your time and it was absolutely the\ngreatest pleasure to speak to you and get to pick your brains of all\nthe wonderful information you have i really hope we can sit down and\nhave another chat sometime soon because i am sure that you have\ngot a lot more to tell so i thank you for your time it is been a very great\npleasure thank you part 2\n\n\n\nkerry\ncassidy (kc okay this is kerry cassidy project camelot\nwhistleblower radio and we are talking to michael tellinger having\na fascinating discussion about well actually the lost ruins of\nenki and the anunnaki and the early human civilization which is a\nlot earlier than most people are prepared to accept so\nmichael are you with me here michael\ntellinger (mt i am with you kerry great well i have got some very excited people out there just\nlistening to you and hearing the link-ups that you have been making indeed with actual channeling and the anunnaki i have\ngot someone over here that is also been writing to me talking to me\nabout how excited they are to be getting some validation on certain\nsubjects regarding the ruins that you have been discovering and so i\nthink that that is real exciting and perhaps we can take some calls\nat the last 15 minutes of this hour prior to that i had just like to\nget into more depth with you so basically you are in a position to be getting more information a\nmultitude of ways and i am wondering where does credo mutwa fit in\nwith this has he been participating for example in the\nchannelings or was he even instrumental in introducing you to this\nwoman jackie and so on no not really kerry i went to credo to present him with a copy of\nadam's\ncalendar\nwhen we first released it just over a year-and-a-half ago i spent\nthe day with credo and i videotaped our discussion for five hours i am about to release that incidentally that video on my website www.zuluplanet.com\nfor those that are interested in credo and what he has to say it is\na fascinating discussion for five hours with credo and myself so\nthat'll be available on zuluplanet.com in the next that is very exciting i cannot wait to hear that and was credo in\ntouch with the anunnaki or was he in touch with reptilians or both or what is his take on all of that well i think he is got probably a broader take than anyone else i have\never heard of or that i have ever met or spoken to we spoke you\nknow in detail about the anunnaki and so forth but\nthe most important thing that came out of that meeting with credo was\nthat he confirmed to me that adam's calendar was he was the first\nperson to confirm to me that adam's calendar was what we thought it\nwas that it was a very important site on planet earth he\ntold me \u2013 and you will see that in that interview \u2013 he told\nme that it is the most sacred site on earth the other thing that he\nsaid he told me that it is where heaven\nmated with mother earth and i did not understand that at all now there are two important sites in southern africa adam's calendar is\none of them that is in south africa very close to where i live\nat the moment i live in a place called waterval boven which means\n\u201cwaterfall higher up or \u201cupper waterfall which is pretty much in the center in the heart of one of these\nancient lost cities of enki we are surrounded by absolutely\nastonishing stone ruins where i am right now then\nthe other ancient important site is in northern botswana it is called\nthe tsodilo sites \u2013 serpent sites and both of them are\ndirectly linked to the creation of the human race now i did not quite understand the link between those two until quite\nrecently and what it seems like is that the serpent worship site in\nnorthern botswana the tsodilo site that is where the anunnaki did\nall their experiments \u2013 all their cloning experiments and\nmessing with the dna and so forth until they finally had what they\nbelieved was the fertilized egg or the genetic structure that they\nwere happy with and\nthen it was at adam's calendar that the actual insemination or\nfertilization process took place and this was i mean you can imagine if you say this to people out there that have not been\nin touch with this kind of material or this research they just freak\nout you know they cannot deal with it so when i take people to adam's calendar and i take them through\nthis sort of two-and-a-half kilometer stretch of the mountain and i\nshow them all the stuff and all the different elements that fit\ntogether i mean they are blown away it is truly a\nlife-changing experience and i think it is a very spiritual\nexperience and it raises you to a different level of consciousness\nthat you never imagined you could go to before when\nyou go to the main site adam's the actual calendar itself there is one area in there that is sort of surrounded by three\nmonoliths that have now fallen down one of them is a very\nsphinx-looking-like monolith that is now broken \u2013 or statue should i call it and\nin the middle of those three which is right in the center on the\nnorth-south dividing line that splits the calendar right down the\nmiddle right in the center of that is where jackie and the other\npsychic ladies all confirmed that that is where the insertion or the\nactual fertilization process of the seven anunnaki birth-mothers or\nbirth-females took place that is where they were inseminated\nand impregnated with the fertilized eggs that then carried the first\nhomo\nsapiens now\nthat is when the words of credo came back to me that\nis where heaven mated with mother earth\nsuddenly had a completely different meaning and you can imagine oh yeah absolutely fascinating well i am looking at your site zuluplanet.com and i am seeing as you are speaking some of the photos\nof the area which the landscape is absolutely stunning i have to\nsay that as well so i think the land itself must exude some pretty\npowerful magic or call it what you will yeah i had a few people over the past year or so that i have taken\nthere that are you know highly psychic and they measured energies\nthere i mean they have been there with all kinds of tools and devices\nto measure the energy and the ley lines and so forth i can tell you\nthat confirming from at least 20 different people that have been\nthere there are at least five ley lines that run right through\nadam's calendar yeah that is really amazing i mean i have to say that i myself am\nvery drawn to this area and i have been saying that camelot should\ncome down there and film you and i am still going to offer that\nagain if there are people listening to this show who want to\ncontribute to our finances to make that possible you know i am going\nto go down there and do some filming because i think it is\nreally very interesting and\nthere is also an aspect of what you are doing in other words what\nit means to uncover the real history of humanity as opposed to you\nknow the lies that we have been told over centuries and centuries as\nschool children and so on and what you are saying in terms of how it\nchanges people i\ndo believe that it would change humanity in general if even this idea\nwere to become to be talked about and accepted in general on the\nplanet there would be a different way of looking at you know what\nit means to be human and perhaps even affect things like wars and so\non absolutely and this is why i am so you know passionate about this\ndiscovery and these findings you said it earlier this is right\nat the moment i am completely and utterly consumed by this you know this is what i do day in day out i do not you know i do not have\na job this is what i do i wake up in the morning and i do more\nresearch i go up the mountain and i do more research and i find\nthings and then i put pieces of the puzzle together and have more\nmaterial to be able to extrapolate our theory further and\nthis has led to some very very profound \u2013 more connections\nthat you are not aware of yet that i had like to bring up \u2013\nwhich links directly into first of all what credo mutwa has been\nsaying what zecharia sitchin has been writing about and then also\nsome of the more scientific people that you have interviewed like dan\nburisch and david wilcock and their discoveries and their findings\nlink directly into this this\nis what i do when i do my presentations and my seminars i tell\npeople very clearly that you cannot separate anything from anything when you start reading and researching ancient human history you have\ngot to be prepared to have a very open mind and deal with every\naspect of everything that you find because\nthe smallest little clue or the smallest little statement that\nsomebody makes today that has absolutely no meaning to you like this\nis where heaven mated with mother earth you know a few weeks or a few years later suddenly that penny drops\nand you go oh\nmy god how would i have been so blind this is such an important\npiece of the puzzle just\nto tell you for example the work that dan burisch has been doing you mentioned earlier the lotus project that he is been working on well looking at your interviews with him and looking at his work i\nsuddenly realized that that is directly and inextricably linked to\nthese ancient ruins right here and the effect that the stones have\nand had\non these structures for\nexample i discovered that the stones used to build these ruins are\nat least 50 percent silica dioxide which is basically quartz\ncrystal the rest of it is iron and aluminum so we are dealing\nwith a substance and\nthese are very strange stones this is not an average kind of stone\nyou pick up on a mountain these stones were specifically brought\nfrom the river beds \u2013 we assume\nthey were brought from the river beds \u2013 because they are all\nrounded and they look like stones that have been you know well\neroded through the work of water over millions of years these\nstones are a very special consistency of silica dioxide and iron and\naluminum  which immediately made you know the alarm bells ring\nvery loudly for me saying well if it is silica if it is quartz pretty much 50 percent\nquartz crystal if you can call it that we are\ndealing with substances that can hold information transfer\ninformation transmit information conduct all kinds of energies\nand so forth then\ni discovered dan burisch's work where he talks about his discoveries\nthat silica oxide stones and rocks have this capacity to transmit or\nemit these pockets of electromagnetic energy and suddenly you know you realize okay we are dealing with something really special here this all\nlinks together and\nnot only that but when he talks about the fact that they took you\nknow he treated yeast cells and brought them back to life and they\nturned into animal cells of sort of unknown origin and they could\ncreate with crystals spontaneous life i go okay hold on we are not just dealing with an ancient city here and gold\nmining and the knowledge of levitation and using different energy using sound energy to you know move things and crush rock and\nlevitate things and so forth but we are also dealing with a very\nadvanced knowledge and understanding of how to generate life exactly it sounds like there is a conductive quality that these\nsites might actually have making even possible doing such things as\nbeing in contact with enki and other beings that are off-planet possibly in other words it sounds like it could be conductive\nmaterial i do know that with dan burisch's work one of the things\nthat was very obvious is that there was as you say the ability to\ncreate life or to allow life to come through it yeah which is an interesting thing is that kind of yeah where you are going with this absolutely it is so clear to me now that these guys were so way\nahead of where you know the way that we think today and\nthese structures that we are finding were not only you know they are different types of structures and it is again it\ntook a long time it took at least seven years for us to figure this\nout and two-and-a-half years of my personal time to figure out what\nthese different structures were for and the different shapes some\nof them might have been just energy devices devices to generate\nenergy and then channel it down these ancient roads \u2013 or these\nchannels which we now call channels \u2013 that they channeled this\nenergy and\nthen others were places where they would crush the rock and\nother places where i found these hexagonal shapes about 3 meters\nacross \u2013 maybe not even two-and-a-half two to three meters\nacross \u2013 these honeycombed hexagonal-shaped ruins that are\nclustered together always on slopes on mountain slopes on the\nhillsides at a very steep angle which would allow water to pass\nthrough them and then separate the different metals through\nvibrational frequency and so forth and be able to collect them at\nthe bottom which would be the easiest way to do that but\nto come back to so is it possible they were not just in other words my mind is\ngoing a mile a minute here and i have to i am sorry for\ninterrupting here but i had like to know if it is possible that they\nwere not only discovering gold but they were also possibly doing\nsome transmuting of different metals even possibly working on\ncreating gold yep that is one aspect yeah and then the other aspect that comes to mind is that with the power\nin these stones to actually allow for a certain amount of maybe teleportation or something that boriska one of our indigo children\nthat we interviewed talked about which was when people died on mars that they were their souls or their essences were incased in he\ncalled it in\nstones and basically were brought to earth i am\nwondering \u2013 and this is really far-fetched-sounding \u2013 but\ni am wondering if there was something going on like that that perhaps\nthe souls that actually were put into these genetically-engineered\nhumans were possibly even from you know from their home planet in\nother words possibly even using the bodies as vehicles i know this sounds quite far-fetched but yeah kerry you know it might sound far-fetched but it is as\nplausible and as possible as anything else we are discussing and i will\ntell you why why it may actually just be so you\nmight have actually just put your finger on a very important aspect\nof this ancient civilization here because i now believe that these\nwere not just you know dwellings and places for worship and places\nfor work and crushing stone and separating the ore for example and as you said also transmutating the metals from maybe the\nphysical gold to white powder gold and so forth um incidentally that is where i believe the biblical word \u201cmanna actually\nalso emanates from here which was the nama namaqua the sonqua the\nsonqua people lived in a place called namaqua nama\ncould be the original word in my opinion for what later became\nmanna\nin the bible they just you know twisted it a little bit since\nthis was the place where the first gold in the world came from and\nthey were also transmutating it into white powder gold it is quite\nplausible that this was the namaqua the land of the white gold that in the bible then became \u201cmanna\nfrom heaven but i am digressing a bit here oh right that does sound logical i have to say and follows some\nof the work that we have heard from jordan maxwell as well but go\nahead i had love to hear the rest what i believe as well is that many of these stone circular\nstructures \u2013 now that we know that they are pretty much silica\noxide very strong crystal abilities \u2013 i believe now that many\nof these were also cloning tanks they were actually cloning humans\nhere en\nmasse and i am not talking babies i am talking cloning humans into an adult\nform because what you have got to ask yourself is well the physical evidence is\nhere we have over 10-million stone ruins so now you have got to\nstart putting the numbers together okay how many people lived here as i said earlier anything between 50- and 200-million people you\ndo the sums and you know assumptions yourself but\nlet us say that even there were 50-million people you know to breed\nand to create 50-million people from babies is not going to happen\novernight and if you want to run gold mines and you want people to\nwork in these gold mines you are going to have to come up with a very\nadvanced cloning project to create these people that can work in\nthese gold mines so\nit is now clear to me that we are dealing \u2013 because of the\nspecial properties of the silica oxide and the way that they could\ngenerate life and create spontaneous life and create transmutate cells from dead yeast cells into live cells and all\nthese incredible and weird properties \u2013 i believe that many of\nthese were advanced cloning chambers they were actually cloning\nhumans into adult forms yeah that actually makes sense i have to say and there is also an\naspect of that that would have been you know for and this is\njust again i do not know obviously what i am talking about here but its amazing how there could be an aspect because enki and\nenlil were famous  and i do believe that this element is correct \nfor not getting along and therefore enki was also involved in doing\nthings that were perhaps on a certain level secret yep from what his brother would know yep and so it is possible as i said before that there could be\nsort of a teleportation of souls or energy going into these clones one thing that we are getting \u2013 and this may sound like a\ncompletely different topic \u2013 but we are getting information\nright now that there are synthetic beings here on the planet some of\nwhich are created by our government and some of which may be\nreturning that were originally created in the times of atlantis but\none of the things that has been told to me by a whistleblower is\nthat not only that we have some dolphin-human hybrids there were\nbeing created in the lab by our government in an undersea base and\nthat these beings were being inhabited in essence by humans that are living now in\nother words the body is created and then very much like the movie\navatar that these humans are then inhabiting these beings inhabiting their\nbodies and then allowing them to do whatever they need to do in\nother words i do not know carry out a war carry out exploration of\nspace and so on and so forth if the body is destroyed the human is\nnot yeah and so by the same token if you take that and you take that into\nthe days of the anunnaki it is possible that something like\nthat might have been going on with them because they were so\nadvanced right yeah and this is we have got to maybe spend a bit of time on this because this is very important the kind of lives we live today in\nthis ridiculously dumbed-down state that we are in as a species totally controlled by the media and the drug companies and our\ngovernments that are just obviously doing everything in their power\nto keep us dumbed down and marching like little soldiers we have\ngot to step out of this this terrible dream and tap into plug into reality \u2013 what is been going on on planet earth for millions of\nyears and what is been going on in the universe for billions of\nyears i think it is really exciting that there are people that are\nopening up to this and waking up to this reality one\nof these things you mentioned earlier i want to come back to which\nis again another direct link you said teleportation and etcetera well many of these sites that we found \u2013 adam's\ncalendar being one itself \u2013 adam's calendar is still an active\nportal okay and that has been confirmed by a number of psychics and not just my friend jackie and her group but various others that\ni brought there it\nwas interesting i had a team of people a team of psychics from\ntwelve different countries \u2013 24 people from twelve different\ncountries \u2013 from new zealand brazil germany czech republic usa canada china  it was quite astounding and\nthey were all highly psychic people when i took them to adam's\ncalendar kerry it was like watching a bunch of 5-year-olds let\nloose in a candy store it was quite incredible i can imagine i have to say they gave me so much information i felt like a sponge i just stood\nthere i should have shared with them everything i knew and\neverything i felt and they just gave back and they just gave me all\nthis information that they could feel and pick up and psychically intuitively feel so i learned so much from that particular group but\njust to come back to your teleportation adam's calendar is an active\nportal that i know and we have seen some very strange things there\nover the last few years that are really weird the magnetic and the\nenergy fields there are absolutely weird \u2013 gps does not work at\nall inside the adam's calendar circle it just goes completely\nhaywire makes no reason why it should do that and then a few meters\noutside of it it works absolutely perfectly so\nthat seems to confirm that there is a weird activity going on there and then various other sites stone circle sites that i have found are\nalso active portals that i have been told by some psychic people and\nthis is another interesting thing that directly links to the work of\ndavid wilcock i know in his work he talks about the montauk project and you have interviewed various people on that as well they talk\nabout the montauk \u201cchair the chair that they\nreverse-engineered and they found that it had 22 frequencies \u2013\n22 specific frequencies out of which all the other frequencies\nemanated well that is exactly the direction that my research is going in as well and this 22 is becoming a very important number because 22 is in\nmy new book that i am working on with an absolutely brilliant\nscientist and he is obviously channeled from the highest level his\nname is [phonetic\nspelling] \u2018vilim deswart and\nwe are busy finishing a new book called the\nsecret numbers of god which i think is going to just also open up a whole new chapter and\ndoor to understanding how all these things fit together vilim has pretty much decoded the entire universe all the sacred geometry\nnumbers how it works and why it works and how it links to the\nsource or god and created the link between space-time and\ntime-space and how it works with a singularity he unpacks this so\nbeautifully and so simply with basic geometry that you actually go how\nhave we missed this all these years it is so simple well he is also unpacked the fact that you know 22 is a very important\nnumber twenty-two is actually the number which describes how we\ninterconnect with the divine and that there are 22 images or\npatterns that actually describe the infinite in a limited world or\nthe 3-d time of god or the creator the creative source how it\ntransmits and how it manifests itself in the physical world in 3-d\nspace there are 22 patterns and 22 images so\nthis is all important so\nnow we have got the montauk chair that has got 22 frequencies we have\ngot our new work specifically\n\u2018vilim\ndeswart\u2019s work that shows that there are 22 images and patterns and frequencies\nthat pull all this together and\nwe have guess what in these cloning chambers where i believe the\nanunnaki cloned the human race \u2013 and millions and millions of\nthem \u2013 guess what we have we have silica oxide crystal-like\nrocks that had the capacity to generate life okay and guess how\nmany chromosomes the early humans had twenty-two pairs of\nchromosomes okay the 23rd is a sex chromosome the x and the y that were slapped on there later once they wanted us to procreate on\nour own so\nthere is a very direct link in all of this and i believe also the\nresearch going on with the dna and the chromosomes and how they are\nreceptors of light and information \u2013 transmitters and receptors\nof information and light and all these things i believe that in\nthere lies the secret to teleportation itself that your chromosomes and these 22 chromosomes and the 22 frequencies are responsible for\nallowing us to teleportate or travel through space-time and\ntime-space oh wonderful this is so great okay we are continuing on the other side of the hour we are going to break\nright now and thank you so much michael tellinger we will be right\nback on the air with michael tellinger this is project camelot\nwhistleblower radio okay michael so we are going off down the rabbit hole  and\nwe are yeah talking about teleportation at this moment and the number\n22 and how that factors in with the fact that these stones are\nsilicon \u2013 basically crystals for all intents and purposes and\nthat they may indeed that you have got a portal operating\nthere you are\ntalking about in some ways almost what seems to be \u2013 and this\nis sort of maybe a corny way of putting it \u2013 but a direct\ntelephone line between this planet via the adam\u2019s calendar and\nthat area of the globe back to wherever the anunnaki originally came\nfrom yeah it certainly seems like that kerry and the more you look at\nit the more it rings true and that is just incredible you\nknow i\nwish i could play to you right now the ringing sounds of some of\nthese rocks it has such an effect on people i am coming back\nto the sound effect now and just also the important moment that i\nfelt when it suddenly broke for me that this is what is\nhappening here that sound was used to create these devices that\nsound was used for the energy that sound also\nremember that dan burisch\u2019s work \u2013 he suggests very\nstrongly that this spontaneous generation of life the cells that\nthey created in his project lotus and the reconstitution of dead\nyeast cells came as a result of some sort of audio or sound\nfrequency everything\nthat we study even in the bible it says you know in\nthe beginning there was the word and the buddhists believe in the om\nas this primordial creative force the sound the om and then you\nrealize that the om has six aspects and six frequencies that make up\nthe central aspect of om the six around the one \u2013 the six days\nof creation and the seventh one is in the middle and so forth and\nthese are all linked to vibrational frequencies in music if you\nunderstand that and then you get the 12 spheres around the one you\nknow which is the 12 disciples around christ and all these things those\nare all images imagery of vibrational energies and frequencies that\nmany people still have not figured out yet and this is how it\nall fits together so beautifully when you start putting it together it just starts to fit like a glove everything seems to work and\neverything fits and\nthis is what is so incredible with the work that i am doing with\n\u2018vilim\ndeswart and\nhis absolute clarity on unpacking all this stuff and showing how 3-d\ntime transmutates into 3-d space and how it all works so easily and\nso simply and then when we compare it to the structures we have\nhere and you just go okay exactly\nwhat you said we are looking at an ancient site that was\ndirectly connected to the rest of the universe they could come and\ngo as they wanted they could create life they used the 22 basic\nfrequencies of light or sound or whatever it is that you want to call\nit the primordial frequencies that can create life and give you the\nability to go from 3-d time to 3-d space and so forth and we are also talking about the idea being that in essence \u2013\nand this is something camelot has been also sort of exploring and\ntapping into \u2013 which is the idea that we are all time\ntravelers in essence yeah and that this capability is built into our bodies yeah it is built into our the abilities that we have that we\nhave forgotten that we have yes and i think it is linked to the fact that we have got\nthese 22 chromosomes once again originally it seems like we had 24\npairs of chromosomes but two of them were fused chromosome 2 and\nchromosome 4 if i remember correctly now were fused at some stage you know early back in time now who would have fused it you\nknow so if you come back to the concept of cloning and creating a humanoid\nspecies that can become a time traveler by the anunnaki cloned by\nthe anunnaki they would have and if it is indeed so which i\nbelieve it was that they took a species that already existed and\nthey just messed with the dna and they created a new more advanced\nstructure for a being that could do all these things they fused two\nof the chromosomes so that we ended up with 22 chromosomes so they could create them or they could suck this energy out of the\nether and create these humans on earth to you know do menial work\nfor them initially but also later the species evolved into you and i\nthat are now discussing all these weird things and right well i think that there is some aspects of this which obviously there are millions of aspects that we are tapping on\nhere but the idea of fusing chromosomes and actually we get into\nthe \u201cjunk dna the aspect that there was a point at\nwhich humans were interfered with to basically stop their\ndevelopment to dumb them down to keep them on this prison planet  \u2013\nin essence you could even say where the souls might have gotten\nlocked into the bodies losing their connection with the source and\nso on and so forth yeah yeah yeah there could be aspects of that that you are actually tapping\ninto there yeah exactly exactly i am not sure how one can describe it but i think you put it very clearly there were definitely aspects of\nit and there is a lot of evidence that we have been dumbed\ndown and we are stuck on this prison planet some of us are\ntapping into higher levels of awareness and consciousness and\nallowing our dna to fortunately whoever it was whether it was malicious anunnaki or malicious other\nbeings that did that dumbing down fortunately it is very\ndifficult to keep the dna dumbed down because as we now know \u2013\nyou know this well \u2013 our dna allows itself to keep evolving and to keep improving and keep upgrading itself and bruce lipton\nshows that very clearly himself in his work yeah so this is more work that david wilcock has been you know pointing to if nothing else he is basically joining dots that other\nscientists have come across yeah and so we are talking about a whole sort of transmutation even of\nthe human species at this point yeah and i want to come back a little bit if i may to some of the\nstatements that are also made about this ancient civilization in the\nlost book of enki because it talks about you know enki building his \u201cbeloved\ncity and also by the way this is what came out in my channeling with\nenki that came out and he mentions this \u201cbeloved\ncity and how much he loved it and how he loved the people this\nis again very consistent with the translations of the sumerian\ntablets and the constant tussle between enlil and enki the way he\nspoke and the way that the entity that came through the channeling\nspoke and referred to this place here and the energy forms and the\nenergy that they used when i first heard it i did not\nunderstand it it took me another six months or so to try and figure\nit out and understand what the hell he was talking about but\nhe spoke about the circular the\nconcentric cities the cities they built in concentric circles and that went out and\nthat is exactly when you look at the structures down here everything is built in concentric circles and that is just\nabsolutely amazing wow we are going to so many different areas here and i have to\nthank you for being willing to go down all these different paths obviously as you say you need to have an extraordinarily open mind to be\ndealing with what you are dealing with to be entertaining all\nthe possibilities there and i have to say that i think it is\nfascinating how this area of the world has even been overlooked and\nmore or less ignored and perhaps that is been purposeful maybe exactly \u2013 purposeful and maybe there was a good reason\nfor it because just imagine if this kind of information was\nunleashed 50 years ago it would have just been shoved under the\ncarpet but\nnow because of people like you and bill and other projects of a\nsimilar nature exposing lost ancient knowledge and of higher\nconsciousness and higher developed civilizations that we have\nforgotten about as a dumbed-down species this allows us now to take\nthis knowledge and actually do something with it to take this\ninformation and share it on a much larger platform that we may not\nhave had 10 or 20 or 30 years ago it would have been lost and\nprobably lost for another much longer period as well as to possibly communicate across large distances with the\noriginal creators who some will say who are still here some are\nactually on the planet now from what i understand if\nyou listen to clark mcclelland you will hear him talk about\nseeing some very very tall beings that were interacting on the nasa\nspace shuttle and so on and so forth apparently giving orders of\nsome kind so there is a secret level to this that goes all the way\ninto the negative side of the equation and what is really going on\nbehind the scenes it\nmay be that we are awakening or that you are awakening down there a\nconnection with the more positive side the positively-oriented\nintentions for the human race originally and opening some of those\ndoors once and for all here and so i have to applaud you for all of\nyour efforts and for your wonderful enthusiasm in this area what\ni would like to do is take calls from the listeners because this has\nbeen extremely exciting i think radio very extraordinary where\nthings are being discussed that are really groundbreaking so if we\ndo have callers feel free to call in the\nphone number is on our website on www.projectcamelot.org and also on the microeffect.com if you go to that website and you\nwant to find the call-in number but\nto continue perhaps you can also talk about a little bit more of\nwhat you are finding out just in terms of this area and these\nreally exciting things that you are discovering maybe even more\nof the channeled information that you have been getting i\ncannot even imagine what you may be asking or tapping into\nthere yeah kerry i have been very fortunate to also people\nfrom all over the world e-mail me and it is just growing at an\nexponential rate at this stage so i have been also very\nfortunate in people sharing their specific talents and gifts with me one\nof them is a chap in america i am not going to mention his\nname but he sent me some channeled information and some remote\nviewing transcripts that he had of coming to south africa about\n280,000 years ago and describing the gold mines of south africa\nunder those early anunnaki and early settlement days they are\nabsolutely staggering it is mind-blowing stuff you actually when\nyou read it you feel as if you are here the\nother information the channeled information that i was given was\nthat i was here over 200,000 years ago i was part of this i cannot\nnow remember if i was one of the anunnaki or if i was one of the sort\nof earthling slaves or what my function was that was not quite\nclear i need to go back and channel that information again but that\nis probably why i am so obsessed with bringing this information\nout and\nthen the other interesting thing i want to come back to if i can\nvery quickly is the confusion that exists between the anunnaki and\npossibly the draco and the lizard people and the reptilians and orion\nor the talls i certainly have not been able to draw any clear\ndistinction between those because they do cross over on many\noccasions and\neven here at adam\u2019s calendar we have distinct alignments with\norion\u2019s belt also just to mention for your listeners what i\ndid not mention we have the first carved sphinx the first\ncarved horus stone we have the first pyramids and these are going\nback to 280,000 years okay this is not just a few thousand years\nago so\nthis is all linked to adam\u2019s calendar and very beautifully\nlinked with a fibonacci and a golden mean spiral clearly showing us\nthat these people had a clear understanding of energy and the flow of\nenergy and clearly a lot more things than just that so\nwe are dealing with the origins of all these symbols plus also\nthe ankh what we believe to be the egyptian ankh the ankh is actually a\nsouthern african a south african symbol that came from this first\ncivilization here in south africa and i believe the ankh to have\nbeen the source of the frequency the vibrational frequencies that\nwere used to kick-start these cloning tanks these mining processing\nplants the teleportation chambers and whatever the\nankh was the frequency that got it all going it was like a key like\na tuning fork that got all these things going and this is where the\nringing stones come into play it really really is extraordinary i mean what you are\ntalking about is just so actually mind-blowing and mind-expanding you know mike we have some people calling in and i do want to give\nthem a chance to ask their questions yeah let us go ahead so if you would not mind i am going to take holly it\nlooks like from virginia who is on the line holly are you there hol\n yes i am here okay hello there and you are welcome to ask michael a\nquestion hol\n okay this is not a question but actually a comment what you have\ndescribed is really similar to what i read from the book the\nancient secret of the flower of life\nby drunvalo melchizedek and i have been a fan of project camelot the first time when i heard the interview with bob dean and what he\nsaid that human was really genetically engineered by the anunnaki i\nsaid oh i have read this from the book \u201cthe ancient secret of the\nflower of life and\nit has been described in detail there and now when i listen to you i plan to go and buy the book the\nslave species of god but from what you have said it is really similar of what okay hol\n drunvalo melchizedek said and i think that this is really\nlike something true here because i am also like follow\nthis very closely and i can say that a lot of information are coming\ntogether this is really something true not something that people\nmake up or anything so i am really excited and now that i feel\nthat you are like talking with those psychics and then have a lot of\ninformation i am really like excited and looking forward to\nhear about those things so\nwhen are you going to publish or let us know about the things that\nthe psychics have told you all right if i could answer that thank you very much the one\nthing that i have not mentioned at all in this interview for two\nhours  is that my new book has just been released it is\ncalled temples\nof the african gods\nand it is available on zuluplanet.com you can order the\nhardcover book or you can even download the e-book if you want it\nimmediately we have\nonly printed 3,000 copies of the book because that is all i\ncould afford so i had like to sell those online as quickly as i\ncan so we can get some money to print some more because that is absolutely wonderful and thank you caller i will go\nto the next caller now and michael you know i am definitely\ngoing to be one of those people downloading your e-book that is\nreally exciting all of your research is absolutely fascinating and\ni will be very interested in hearing about your next book even after\nthis janet\nfrom new jersey i believe is calling in and are you on the line janet jan\nhi kerry hi michael hi there hello janet jan\n what you are saying michael is just fabulous i have a\nquestion about the anunnaki you claim that or you suppose that\nthey made the human beings the angelic human beings well anna\nhayes from the voyager\nseries\nsays pretty much everything you say except she claims that they did\nnot make the angelic humans \u2013 us \u2013 they made the\nneanderthal what do you think about that i do not think that they made the angelic beings personally at this stage where my knowledge lies at the moment i am of\nthe opinion that they just made the homo\nsapiens not necessarily the neanderthals but the homo\nsapiens but\nit could be the neanderthals as well because we are dealing\nwith another species down here in south africa called the boskop the\nboskopoid humans\n[https johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/brain/paleo/lynch-granger-big-brain-boskops-2008.html that is a huge mystery to historians archaeologists anthropologists they have no idea where they fit in but they\ndefinitely fit into the neanderthal kind of humanoid and they could\nhave actually been the \u201cfirst people that were cloned it is quite possible one\nof the great mysteries in all of this and this is mind-blowing imagine we have got this huge ancient city that covers the whole\nof southern africa it never stopped it just went on and on and on and we have not found a single skeleton now that is a huge huge\nmystery you know you had imagine we had be finding yeah actually i was going to ask you that i was actually going to\nask you that when i think we went to break and i was mentioning the\nwork of klaus dona because there have been large skeletons\ndiscovered in various other places around the planet but it is\nvery interesting to hear that you have not recovered any large\nskeletons in that area that you are talking about no nothing i must tell you that after what seven years of trying\nto get some sort of engagement from the south african government we\nfinally have an open door i have been invited to do a\npresentation to sahra \u2013 the south african heritage resource\nauthority \u2013 on the fifth of february i am doing a\npresentation to all the stakeholders tourism and archaeology and\nheritage and the parks board people and so forth i am\npresenting all this research and information to them the\nwoman that runs it here in the mpumalanga province is so excited\nabout it and she is become i suppose if i can call her the\nchampion \u2013 nkosazana machete\n[https www.eskom.co.za/content/501096%20-%20comments%20from%20sahra.pdf by\narchaeology palaeontology untt of the heritage resources agency south africa has a unique and non-renewable archaeological and\npalaeontolagical be made by the sahra mpumalanga provincial\noffice (mrs nkosazana machete www.eskom.co.za 501096%20-%20comments%20from%20sahra.pdf and\ni hope that with her support and help now we can finally get the ears\nof the government and start getting some funding i\nmust tell you as well i mean you mentioned the word funding\nearlier at this stage all this research and the foundation that\nwe have set up called the makomati foundation \u2013 and that is\nanother website listeners can go to \u2013 but all the funding that\ncomes into the foundation has come out of johan heine\u2019s pocket\nand my personal pocket so we could certainly do with a little bit of\ndonation from people that can afford a few bucks you\nknow go on to the makomati website and if you can help us so that\nwe can go out and do some more research absolutely otherwise buy the book buy the book so i can sell some\nbooks so i can do some more research well you know that would be wonderful and we would love to\nencourage people to do that and thank you caller we will go to\nthe next caller after this but what i would like to say is the\nmakomati could you spell that for the listeners yes it is m a k o m a t i m a k o m a t i it is\nwww.makomati.org actually we just changed it to makomati.org because it is an\norganization a non-profit organization a foundation for the\npreservation the maintenance and research on these ancient ruins and\non that website you will see some beautiful photographs as well and there is a donation button that you can go to so wonderful go ahead sorry you wanted to take some more callers if you want to take\nsome more no well if there was anything specific you wanted to cover because we do only have five minutes left so if there is\nsomething specific you wanted to say very briefly we have i mentioned earlier we have a very\ndistinct link to orion\u2019s belt orion rising so that orions or\nthe talls as some of your previous guests have also called them we\nalso have a distinct link to various other star systems like draco very distinct link to draco and tuban and\ntherein lies a slight conflict between the draco the draconians and the lizard people and then the nordic or the talls or possibly\nthe anunnaki i am not quite sure how the two fit and how they\ncross over i have not yet figured that out and i hope to get\nmore clarity on that in the very near future because it has become\nquite confusing because they constantly overlap yeah and i think we are also talking about different times and different timelines that may be yeah converging in the same area because you cannot have\ntime travelers who are in essence able to also cover different\ntimelines and so you have got different beings that may have had\nan impact even on the creation of humanity and so on and had their\nimpact at different times in the process yeah yeah so i guess you are tapping into all of that we are about\nto actually close down here and i am very sorry that we did not\nget a chance to get to the other callers michael this has been a wonderful illuminating discussion i think for all\nof the people out there and for myself i really want to thank you\nso much for coming on the radio show today i\ndo want to stay in touch with you i had love to take a trip\ndown have project camelot do some filming and interview you down\nthere in person and really get into this even on a deeper level i\nthink that would be fabulous so we had love people to\ncontribute to that effort as well please\nbuy michael\u2019s books and let us closing music\nover-rides kerry\u2019s voice]\n\nend of part 2\n\nclick here for the audio interview \n\n\n\u00a0brian o\u2019leary i knew the media would take\n                  over no actually that is kerry she is\n                one of the speakers too so she gets a pass on this one.kerry cassidy that is a great start i want to hear\n                  it again.brian o\u2019leary welcome to montesuenos vilcabamba ecuador south america earth milky way galaxy and this is truly remarkable because when we first put this\n                  conference together which was less than a month ago i think from this remote outpost all of a sudden all of you decided\n                  to come here and i am blown away i would have been surprised that\n                  in a program like this at such a remote location that maybe\n                  we had have 20 people and we had have an intimate\n                  seminar and gathering and conversational affair but no look\n                  what happened and so i say welcome how many of you have traveled from afar in other words let us\n                  say from another continent that is most of you wow well congratulations once again and welcome once again bienvenidos i thought i had start out with a very short\n                  kind of meditation because obviously we are in a time of great\n                  crisis and opportunity and today is all about that it is\n                  all about further defining the crisis behind the scenes mostly\n                  from a gentleman whom i have known for a long time and\n                  who has extraordinary information both logically in the left\n                  brain 3d world and also from off-planet sources and that is george green he is sitting right over\n                  there george is going to be the main speaker today and i am\n                  sure many of you who know him already know of his work are\n                  really looking forward to it.but i thought i had start with a short mediation and\n                  the meditation is really simply a very easy one just close\n                  your eyes and just take a deep breath then exhale any negativity\n                  and the chattering mind and all of that kind of interference and breathe in again and this time imagine this tremendous\n                  amount of light that is present in our beautiful valley it is very accessible here and then exhale again and\n                  then inhale again and imagine this light just filling your\n                  body and protecting you and allowing you to be an agent of\n                  change and with each successive breath let that light accumulate\n                  around you your neighbors the house the village all of\n                  ecuador and the entire world and especially towards those\n                  that are suffering and just give thanks for this opportunity\n                  to come together and then slowly come back into the room open our eyes and i wanted to do this i know george is going to do one too because part of the context of the crisis we are in is\n                  that there is just so many extraordinary things going\n                  on we are kind of in fast-forward toward an unknown destiny but it is quite extraordinary is not it because\n                  the results of this at least in our linear minds the\n                  results could either be total catastrophe nuclear war whatever escalation of what is going on in the middle east earth\n                  changes you know what the crisis is you would not be here if\n                  you did not know a lot about what the crisis we are\n                  in is and that it is also far more serious than you would\n                  be lead to believe by the media or by our political leaders.and so we meredith and i moved here to ecuador rather\n                  suddenly and i can give you all the reasons but the main\n                  reasons were that we saw unrest coming up in the us and we\n                  were like the second visible gringo to move here by visible i mean not wanting to go let us\n                  say into the woodwork and just stay there because we are\n                  still actively many of us now in this room are very\n                  much actively involved in interacting with the culture but\n                  we were basically the second and that was four and half years\n                  ago and we rented a one-room tiny modest cottage which was ostensibly\n                  going to be a ma-and-pa retirement home and then about a year\n                  later when our visions exceeded our wildest thoughts because\n                  we wanted to build a small house here at this site it was\n                  just a foundation then and the bathroom over there that used\n                  to be an outhouse the kitchen used to be the original farm\n                  house here and so meredith and i were off on a trip  and this was\n                  about maybe a half a year into our construction  and the\n                  builder made a mistake he built this huge roof here and we\n                  did not ask for that we just wanted a small house but we looked at each other in amazement and we said to each\n                  other wow this is bigger than we are and that is\n                  been the story of montesuenos ever sense we finished not\n                  really finished but finished this phase of the construction a few months ago we had what was called the phoenix gathering this bunch of visionaries came in from all over the world now you have come in from all over the world  and besides\n                  the carbon debit of using fossil fuels in jets i say it is\n                  really great  but that of course in the future may not\n                  be the situation so in a way that makes this all the more\n                  poignant to be able to personally get together like this before\n                  something else might happen.i do not want to come from fear however and that is one\n                  reason why i said the little meditation was that there was\n                  the presence of some fear prior to this conference now those\n                  of you that are astrologers would say oh that is\n                  just because mercury\u2019s in retrograde and the full moon\u2019s\n                  in cancer or whatever but you know it really has been an extraordinary\n                  week that way we almost felt like canceling the conference the element of fear was so high and then it just evaporated and that seems to be true of this place it is maybe a\n                  little bit like mount shasta it is the weather\n                  moves in but it moves out just as fast as it moves in so i mean i am looking at all of you and i do not\n                  see any any of you from the cia here it is\n                  ok you are welcome you know i often urge\n                  some of the people that are involved in cover-ups and all of\n                  that to join us and you know take part in this enlightenment or whatever you want to call it.so anyway this is montesuenos it is a retreat center we hope you can come back i would love to meet all of you\n                  personally and spend some time with you and we do have residency\n                  programs here and all sorts of things so that is fine and i also want to introduce meredith my artist-wife meredith you should introduce this painting.brian oh i will i will get around to that there is\n                  a painting behind me that she did it is called the\n                  last supper of gaia but we will get into that a little\n                  bit later and indeed it is a last supper resurrection whether\n                  you want to take christian jewish or indigenous metaphor it is all we are headed somewhere we are\n                  on this journey and it is quickening.what i wanted to talk about today just very briefly  because\n                  i want george to take most of the day because his information\n                  and sharing is just wonderful and he is come from afar and the piece that i have been working on is free energy and i can tell you categorically that in the 1990s well\n                  maybe i will go back a little further here i was a typical\n                  left-brain academic reductionistic materialistic 3-dimensional\n                  physicist a physics professor at princeton university and\n                  i took a lifespring training one weekend and i had\n                  a remote viewing experience and then i had a near death experience\n                  in an auto accident then i had some healing experiences and\n                  then i left princeton my colleagues did not believe in fact you\n                  know here i was swilling thimblefuls of sherry at the joseph\n                  henry luncheons every other tuesday and the other professors\n                  there of which there were seven nobel laureates all\n                  males would swill the sherry and talk about how ridiculous\n                  claims to the paranormal are and having just had paranormal experiences i said gee this is not my tribe even though i had some 40\n                    years in it well now we fast-forward to 30 years later and i am\n                  really glad i went on a metaphysical journey which sent me\n                  in many directions but i was always thinking of solutions what is it that\n                    we can do for the culture that can really make a difference and what is the truth of the matter of why it is suppressed\n                    as well as why it exists so i go back and forth between truth-telling consciousness\n                  and the consciousness of actually going into the solutions\n                  and thinking positively and in a way i think that is our job\n                  here is to be able to be respectful and understanding of where\n                  each of us is at personally in our growth and understanding\n                  of what is\n                  happening and what could be.so i got into the free energy business if you would call\n                  it that it is not really a business because as george\n                  knows i cannot really sell my books people are not\n                  reading books anymore well i sell a few here and there so\n                  that is not why i am not in any kind of commercial\n                  business this way it is more like well my exploration of various\n                  modalities in so-called \u201cnew science has now been\n                  a journey that has taken me three decades and has sent me in\n                  many unexpected directions one of the least-expected directions\n                  was when i traveled the world and visited many researchers\n                  and inventors of so-called free energy devices and at that point i was skeptical even though i was openly\n                  embracing the ufo et phenomenon a lot of paranormal things\n                  and healing and blah-blah-blah i had not tackled the\n                  energy piece but also because i had been a professor at various universities\n                  of science policy assessment and advised presidential candidates and congress and so forth on energy policy i thought i had\n                  be an and since my phd was in atmospheric science i was kind of a natural to begin to look at the question of\n                  climate change atmospheric pollution water pollution and\n                  so forth and believe me it is dire it is just as dire as the\n                  doomsdayers say about what is coming down on the planet \u2013 just\n                  sheerly physically you know just looking at the physical\n                  observations without any esoteric at all it is very clear\n                  that human interference with the planet it creating an accelerating\n                  instability that will trigger other phenomena and it is just an outrage to me i mean i invested my\n                  heart and soul after having studied deep ecology and done\n                  more spiritual things i just began to realize that gee we are losing our earth and we are doing it fast and it is our species that is doing it and many of us come from the most powerful nation in the world\n                  and our leaders bush was one extreme of course i am\n                  wanting to say good riddance are you here mr bush no i\n                  did not think so.well no no i actually i have to introduce a prop\n                  here i have an alter-ego the alter-ego\u2019s called the\n                  lapis pig he is a jim henson\u2019s creature shop muppet and he is therapy for me he is basically that part of me that i\n                  want to leave behind he is the physics professor at princeton but is also out for his career and for money and his hero\n                  is dick cheney and his fixation is money so this\n                  is the lapis pig.lapis pig good evening ladies and gentlemen pig\n                  snort noises] have you paid your registration fee snort snort] only if you have tendered monies are you to be admitted\n                  here and you shall do this or else you will perish snorting\n                  pig noises brian well anyway that is my alter-ego and\n                  whenever i get stuck on some sort of issue like money or career\n                  or trying to impress people or whatever it is i get out the\n                  pig and act it out and his mate by the way is the ivory pig she is up\n                  there in the puppet window she is a valley girl and\n                  you can see how they had get along very well because he had\n                  go in plutocratically and make as much money as possible and\n                  she would get her swimming pool and this and that but now i understand that here in ecuador \u2013 and there is\n                  a lot of things happening in this country and i hope your visit\n                  will be a little longer and this is a bit of an advertisement but we may have a room available here for the next three days one suddenly freed up but i hope some of you stay a little longer and kind of check\n                  out this place it is a beautiful country politically\n                  i think it is as favorable as any that i know of on the\n                  planet right now in terms of intention it is not perfect right now the government is kind of trying to walk this line\n                  between giving in to the multi-national oligarchal empire interests and wanting to become as independent as possible and of course that feeds right into the re-localization movement which i know many of us are really getting more and more interested\n                  in  growing our own food everything local barter systems\n                  and local currency etcetera etcetera and just ride out this\n                  period no matter what happens globally and i think this is one of the better spots to do that meredith\n                  and i think that really we just love living here and we\n                  also love the people here our only concern is over-development the\n                  gringos are coming the gringos are coming we have had a lot of people come to town and visit us\n                  and ask us questions i know we have susan and walter here who have been here for almost as long as we have i am\n                  sure susan you have had thousands of questions asked\n                  of you oh what is it like here oh can we do this and actually susan has some property too so you know there are places you can settle that are very beautiful here but we are hoping there will not be too too many people as they say down here the podocarpus freeway the loja freeway and you know the lapis pig wants to build a statue of himself\n                  up on that flat top mountain and then have oil wells and condominiums\n                  and golf courses and tramways anyway that could happen here it is like this could become another san fernando valley we hope not the ivory pig might like that but i think that\n                  many of you would not i think we are all kind of naturalists\n                  at heart.so i want to get back to this energy piece just a little bit\n                  and it is in part because george just brought back with\n                  him \u2013 and it is the first time i gaze my eyes on\n                  it  is my new book the energy solution revolution it is available here but it is kind of my estimate\n                  of what is going on around this question of breakthrough\n                  clean energy because what i discovered during the 1990s when i traveled\n                  the world and visited many of the inventors and i wrote some\n                  books about my travels and interviews with these people and\n                  observations of their experiments is that the concepts are\n                  very real there is abundant energy that comes from the\n                  vacuum of space and it can be tapped under certain conditions for example you can have special magnets that resonate with\n                  this hypothesized zero point and the physics of all of this\n                  is understood actually from the theoretical perspective actually this potential energy field is forced into existence\n                  by quantum theory and by eastern thought the vedas knew this it goes way back the knowledge that the universe has a tremendous\n                  amount of potential energy and we know it also from consciousness that we can tap into\n                  that energy force it is sometimes called etheric energy it is sometimes called orgone energy it is\n                  sometimes called there are a thousand names for it but it is all pretty much the same thing and it is\n                  more akin to eastern thought and indigenous thought than any\n                  kind of lapis pig western scientist.in fact as soon as i started to do experiments in consciousness and\n                  some of the work was done with my colleague at princeton robert\n                  jahn who is the dean of the school of engineering he did some of the pioneering work with random-event generators where a human being would go into the laboratory and focus\n                  their intention on a particular result like flipping coins except this is an electronic device and it actually became\n                  one of those situations where there were significant results\n                  over time it is like flipping a coin and you get you\n                  say you want more heads than tails and indeed you get heads those kinds of things are the result of human intention in\n                  other words the mind or the heart or whatever you want to\n                  call it the human being can influence the results in the\n                  material world well those experiments were just totally messed up by the\n                  physics department the engineering here was the dean\n                  of the school of engineering the energy-engineering department the dean of faculty tried to dismiss him even though he had\n                  tenure and this happens to many people it happened with john mack a leading abduction researcher at harvard and it is happened\n                  to many other people professors are stripped of their credentials the\n                  inquisition is alive and well in america and elsewhere\n                  in the world so these things do happen but bob jahn\u2019s work is nevertheless seminal work it is now being followed up at a more popular more pervasive\n                  level by other researchers that show beyond any reasonable\n                  doubt that human consciousness you know there is a little bit of static i\n                  do not know what that is all about but i guess it is\n                  all right voice it is soul energy.brian it is just the energy yes so when i started to travel the world and visit all of these\n                  researchers it dawned on me that you know it is\n                  kind of a simple deduction but it is possible that if\n                  we had a billion little power-packs that could generate electricity\n                  from the ether or from the vacuum of space that we could\n                  solve the energy problem it is a pretty obvious deduction so it occurred to me that gee maybe i should report\n                    on this maybe i should do a little research on this maybe\n                    i should network with people so you know we held some\n                    of us with scientific backgrounds held various conferences brought in some of the inventors at one point a software billionaire was going to fund the\n                  whole effort that was back in the early 1990s and then he\n                  suddenly backed out i will tell you why he backed out for this we need the lapis pig.lapis pig if you would like to know my opinion i am not dipping into the river of optimized profits and will therefore wait until people blunder with their devices\n                  until we get the one that is most efficacious financially brian and that is exactly how he reacted he did not\n                  want to dip into the river of optimized profits and so one thing after another one time after another these\n                  wonderful devices and some of them are magnetic motors some of them are little solid-state devices some of them are\n                  cold fusion devices some of them are on the concept of sono-luminescence there are many many different technologies there is\n                  ways of splitting water where you get more energy out of it\n                  than quantum theory would predict  and that is traditional\n                  quantum theory not the quantum theory that you really need\n                  to get into which involves consciousness.so you kind of get the picture is that science is struggling just like many of us struggling into the 21st century and\n                  it just happened that the societal choice that was made by\n                  a lot of people was cutting-edge technology might be\n                  the internet that is like magic but this could happen with energy too but the problem is\n                  that it is been suppressed it has been turned because\n                  it is a huge threat to the status quo to supplant an about 5-trillion-dollar industry mostly vested in fossil fuels\n                   to just supplant that with something that is cheap clean safe decentralized and so what do you do about this well my project in writing\n                  this book \u2013 it is been a six-year project just came\n                  to a culmination \u2013 and i came up with many many reasons first of all first and foremost i would say the scientists\n                  are suppressing the work because people that call themselves\n                  scientists are really technicians of the current western paradigm and if you break those ranks you are out i mean once i left princeton that was it my career was\n                  kind of shot what i had to do was get very energetic and go\n                  to a unity or christian science church every sunday and hold\n                  forth and that kind of helped my kids get through college\n                  in the end so you know i was able to piece together a quasi-career\n                  over the last 30 years and just get by pretty much and then there are just so many of these free energy devices\n                   that is the point getting back to that thought is\n                  any one of which could be a big breakthrough but it is\n                  been suppressed and the scientists are among the first to\n                  suppress it there are so many suppression stories but why\n                  go through them you know they are there they are\n                  documented.you know what i mean bertrand russell said the\n                    resistance to a new idea increases as the square of its importance and when you are talking about really important concepts there are diversionary tactics that happen in the culture and the scientists are usually the first line of defense against\n                  importance and in favor of the status quo.and then you radiate outwards there is the media of\n                  course the media has been terribly irresponsible i used to\n                  have access to media all the time when i was a \u201cmainstream\n                  scientist you know i had be on the cbs evening\n                  news and the today show and blah-blah-blah but as soon as i began to even embrace the possibility that\n                  maybe ufos are a real phenomenon or that energy sources could exist\n                  that transcend our current paradigm as soon as i stepped\n                  into that territory i was persona non grata.and that is true of many many scientists and the situation\n                  can even get worse if you are really effective at what\n                  you are doing the situation can even get worse it lead me to write one of the chapters in my new\n                  book is called confessions of a scientific heretic a legend\n                  or a story about the carrot and the stick and carrots\n                  are dangled in front of people that are reasonably especially\n                  scientists that are reasonably effective in their breakthrough\n                  ideas to save the planet and the carrot is to divert\n                  them away from that that is the general story.and then the stick is well if you do not do that whack you know it could a threat it could be assassination it could be any number of things.you know i have been through the mill myself i can say\n                  it from direct and personal experience and many others have too and so tomorrow\u2019s theme is going to be more along the\n                  lines of truth-telling and what is really happening out\n                  there that is been suppressed and now needs to be more\n                  into the public light  and that is our ability to step outside\n                  the box of normal inquiry so there are a number of different\n                  free energy technologies.i talked about consciousness i think it is really important\n                  for us to know that even though we are being divided\n                  and ruled right now still i think the answer in terms of consciousness\n                   if there is an answer at all if we can solve this human\n                  condition and global crisis dilemma  then the one technology\n                  or tool that i think is very powerful potentially is combined\n                  positive human intention now there\u2019ve been some popular books written about\n                  this like mctaggart the intention experiment i\n                  write it up in some of my earlier books about how scientific\n                  experiments show without any doubt that we through groups\n                  of people coming together aligned in intention can really\n                  affect the material world they can heal people they can purify\n                  water and they can do it even on a global scale i mean people\n                  are beginning to do experiments like that i think that would be one of the things the indigenous peoples\n                  could help facilitate this coming together in those kinds\n                  of experiments because there is absolutely no danger\n                  in an experiment like that and some experiments actually show that if the intention is\n                  positive the combined intention it is far more powerful\n                  than combined negative human intention.and so i think that this is really the how shall\n                  i say it the holy grail to use a camelot phrase a\n                  holy grail of our time it is the basis of the science\n                  of the 21st century that is longing to be born it is not\n                  born yet i think it was max planck that said science progresses\n                    with each funeral and sometimes we have to wait for\n                    the old order to die out well we may not have that kind\n                    of time right now so we need to come up with ways of coming\n                    together and combining our positive intention that is\n                    the ultimate science i think.free energy in and of itself i think is also a possibility it is just that we do not want dick cheney running\n                  that one too it then becomes more of a human problem a social\n                  problem a political problem economic problem than it is\n                  a technical one the technologies are there but whenever anybody\n                  tries to develop it it is so thwarted in one way or another and so you have to ask the question well can we create\n                    a world in which it is possible to facilitate this development this kind of development and i always hold out the\n                    hope that maybe we can we can discuss this later of course or if we cannot  and george will talk about this quite\n                  a bit later let us say we cannot well then localization\n                  makes a big difference and we need to work on our own spiritual\n                  growth as george\u2019s books so aptly tell especially the\n                  most recent one the ground crew that we need to\n                  come together in local communities become independent become\n                  centers of light and maybe even i do not know if you ever read a book by morris berman\n                  called twilight of the american culture but he is\n                  a mainstream sociologist and he basically says well yeah we are in for a dark age folks let us just prepare\n                  for it and he uses the metaphor of the monastery or the\n                  monastic kind of little centers of light in an otherwise dark\n                  age and that might be what comes down i do not know or\n                  maybe i do not know if we can get help from off-planet maybe maybe not depends on the degree of help but these\n                  are all questions that george can address much better than\n                  i can.the point being though that we can do it in principle but\n                  we need to be less divided and ruled and we also need to get\n                  off of the sheeple principle and the credibility of free energy you know i was\n                  just giving you some examples of the suppression and i have\n                  come to the conclusion and my colleague wade frazier has come\n                  to the same conclusion which is that to understand free energy\n                  and its potential you almost have to have a certain degree\n                  of sentience it defies logic that people that are otherwise very intelligent what wade would call the structuralists people like\n                  noam chomsky naomi klein and so forth that a lot of these\n                  progressives that are great critics of the way things are in\n                  our culture they do not want to embrace more transcendental\n                  questions like well maybe it is possible there exist\n                  technologies that could be researched that would provide clean cheap safe abundant decentralized free energy as a solution but it does not even enter the minds of people and i\n                  know this because i used to have media access about all this\n                  stuff about two months ago the bbc gave me a call and they said we are\n                    doing a special on new energy and i said great and they said we had like to interview you about\n                    free energy and i said great but this is the first time i have ever\n                  been invited to a media appearance and then uninvited obviously the producer ran it up the flag to the executive\n                  producer who said not allowed.in other words the lapis pigs are in charge no question\n                  about it you do not even have to be paranoid conspiracy\n                  theory because it actually can be cool even though it is\n                  denigrated by the mainstream culture i had like to think\n                  of conspiracy theorists as truth-seekers and not necessarily\n                  always paranoid which is the societal definition.so ok getting back to free energy there are so many sources\n                  of suppression but i think the main one in its own way is us we are\n                  the biggest suppressors it is not the bad boys the guys\n                  that are doing horrible things in the new world order and stuff yeah they are controlling things a lot but to the degree that we can become awakened and that we\n                  can take action is the degree to which we will be able to prevail so i really think that we are the biggest suppressors and when you peel the onion it is like a metaphysical\n                  journey in a sense and it is also an intellectual journey when you peel the onion of free energy where people give all\n                  the reasons in the world oh yeah tell me when i can go\n                  down to k-mart and get mine well that does not\n                  really help what helps is how can i help what is going on here what kinds of devices are out there can i build one can\n                    i get support for this do i need to be quiet about it or\n                    should i be publicly transparent so all of these questions\n                    immediately come to mind if you can even grasp the possibility\n                    of this now you know i remember back in 1961 i was just graduating\n                  from college and john f kennedy got before a joint congress and he said i believe that by the end of the decade we\n                  shall land a man on the moon we shall not flounder in the\n                  backwash anyway jfk you know he set a transformational\n                  goal.now we are setting aside all the stuff of well did\n                  we in fact go to the moon well we at least went around the\n                  moon we know that but landing maybe maybe not i will\n                  have to watch a cd on that one but the point here being that every once in a while a transcendental\n                  goal is publicly acknowledged and it was with that spirit that\n                  i felt for so many years a very positive experiment i was\n                  an eagle scout i grew up in the \u201940s and \u201950s and you know when world war ii was over we were the good\n                  guys it was a happy time pretty much and a visionary time.and when kennedy set that goal i was just ready to get right\n                  in there and be a part of it so in 1967 i was appointed as\n                  the first astronaut to go to mars when it was still in nasa\u2019s\n                  program plan however one year later because of vietnam it was cancelled then i became a vietnam protestor and so in those days things were very positive now the whole\n                  atmosphere is repressive suppressive and we just have to\n                  acknowledge that but realize that well i always like to hold out hope that we can have leaders\n                  who see the light and that can set a transcendental goal even\n                  if it is something as simple you know i did a little work with dennis kucinich on this\n                  question how do you as a politician phrase this so that\n                  it is palatable because it is not palatable\n                  to the powers that be to develop free energy believe me you\n                  know it takes away from their power and their profits.so how do you do this so i was designing a few statements\n                  and speeches that he actually gave for a while but then he\n                  kind of withdrew from that i do not know if anybody gave\n                  him a phone call or what but what i drafted for him was basically we cannot\n                  leave any stone unturned in our quest for clean energy i mean that is a politically positive statement then you can\n                  at least slip it into a renewable energy program.and one of the things that i studied for this book because\n                  i get this happening every day i get about ten emails a day\n                  trying to vet this and this and this concept or technology whether it is free energy or whether it is just the\n                  latest renewable traditional renewable energy source so like one day i might get what about the air car what\n                    about this kind of bio-fuel that is based on algae what about thin films for solar collection what about this\n                    new material for windmills and to my way of thinking in a most general way the news\n                  is bad it is none of the above when you really come down\n                  to it if you are going to support 6 billion people on this\n                  planet now some people do not want to support 6 billion\n                  people on the planet we have to put that into consideration but let us assume we want to provide for everybody.well windmills would cost the capital cost to have\n                  a wind economy for the entire world and associated grid system\n                  would be about 30 trillion dollars well that kind of money of course we can use to bail out wall street but to come\n                  up with a solution no and it is very materials-intensive and it is land-intensive and it is intermittent\n                  and diffuse and solar energy is even more expensive and i am not\n                  trying to say that is bad or wrong i am just saying well hmmm are these really the answers but you see what is happening now is that there is\n                  not only a dumbing-down of this kind of analysis  kind of\n                  almost deliberately-rigged dumbing-down  but you get promotional\n                  hypes from various quarters and right now obama\u2019s beginning\n                  to embrace the dirtier of the more renewable technologies \n                  like clean coal or nuclear that is not renewable that is\n                  nightmares he is not very far along in the curve of course there\n                  could be reasons for that we find out later but the point\n                  is he is not far along on the curve but all the \u201csolar-topia people and i\n                  do not object to that we could have a future with traditional\n                  renewables but that is like discussing dirigibles and\n                  balloons which the wright brothers already flew it is not the kind of thing that is going to be our future actually consciousness will be our future i mean we will be able to do magic however do we have a future and that is a big question because of the turning that\n                  we are involved in now.and that is i think one of the reasons why we are\n                  going to be developing the theme of camelot in the most general\n                  way and then we go to project camelot because in a sense camelot was an attempt the jfk presidency was\n                  an attempt to come up with a kingdom if you will or whatever\n                  you want to call it a political unit that is compassionate\n                  and would seek the truth.and right now i think we are in a position to want to\n                  have a truth and reconciliation process in the united states certainly in israel in israel right now there is apartheid going\n                  on just like south africa there has to be some sort of process\n                  to initiate the truth and there are some truths of course that\n                   like david ray griffin in his writings  there is\n                  some truths that are discarded and instead become sacred\n                  myths that is\n                  his phrase for it so like 9/11 the official story is a sacred\n                  myth the nonexistence of free energy is a sacred myth that\n                  all we can do is wind solar and so forth and look\n                  backwards without looking forward.but you see the free energy question even when you\n                  think of sheer logic the inevitable conclusion you come to\n                   and you do not even have to be sentient you do not\n                  even have to believe in it  all you have to have is a head\n                  on your shoulders to be able to use some logic saying well maybe this is possible so let us research it after all the amount of investment for the research would be equivalent\n                  to a few hours of fighting in iraq you would think that might\n                  be worth it but no it is not even mentioned in fact it is\n                  a no-no it is definitely not to be considered because i have been looking at these questions socially\n                  rather than technically i kind of burned out on the technical\n                  stuff you know i trained as a physicist i went and visited these\n                  inventors i have described them i have written them\n                  up so now i have gone on to say well logically if\n                    this is possible why do not we do it and what is\n                    holding us back and of course we know it is the\n                    powers that be and people allowing tptb to do that to us so that is up to us you see the social and political\n                  process is up to us but any logical person any intelligent\n                  person who is not in denial would say well let us\n                  check it out let us see if this is possible let us\n                  see if we can have truly clean energy and that would\n                  solve many of the problems that we have now in the environment.what i want to do is discuss briefly meredith\u2019s painting\n                  that is behind me it is called the last supper of\n                  gaia and then i wrote this book miracle in the void which\n                  is the chapters of the book correspond to the disciples\n                  around the table of gaia it is a feminine version of\n                  the standard last supper paintings so here on the left side you have the disciple of denial he is hiding behind the american flag watching television\n                  that is plugged into the grid system and it is basically\n                  dumbing-down and there is almost no hope at that stage but you see some of this work that we have done is based\n                  on the work of elisabeth kubler-ross that when you lose a\n                  loved one or get a terminal diagnosis that there are various\n                  stages of grief that you need to go through various emotions and the first one\u2019s always denial this cannot\n                  happen it is not this is not for me and so this is the disciple of denial and then usually you go to anger this disciple up here in\n                  this painting it is the comet colliding with jupiter so you get a thing with the excalibur sword and jupiter in\n                  the comet hitting jupiter that is the disciple of anger the bumper sticker i had for many years in california before\n                  we moved here said the truth will set you free but first\n                  it will piss you off this cannot happen i do not want it to happen who did it i think there are probably a lot of people\n                    right now in that zone i have been going through that\n                    zone and it is not necessarily a linear progression either it is you can be angry and also in denial but you kind of get the picture is that a lot of people are\n                  really angry with what is going on and probably increasingly\n                  so so that is another phase of grief.and then bargaining how do we fit the\n                    round pegs in square holes maybe the us government can do\n                    it maybe obama can do it and then when that does not work  and it usually does not you know rationalizing these things  then depression nothing\n                  else seems to work  very very much into depression and this is what usually happens when a loved\n                  one dies in this case the loved one is the earth i think\n                  as we resonate with the earth we feel a tremendous amount\n                  of unconscious fear denial of what is going on anger\n                  about how it is\n                  being raped bargaining about well maybe this would do\n                  it maybe solar will do it maybe obama will do it maybe maybe maybe and then depression when none of that works.and then the good news is that then you go over to\n                  the other side of the table and the disciple way on the right\n                  is the disciple of acceptance and that is usually the\n                  final phase of the grief process where you say well ok this stuff happened gaia\u2019s dead i accept the co-existence of the old and the new that we are\n                  almost like splitting into two different consciousnesses one\n                  is the consciousness that is directed toward solutions and the other one directed into the accepting the what-is as it is but not doing it in a way that is totally passive\n                  and where you are just sitting here and denying it or\n                  in depression where you are just not very effective at\n                  anything you know just sorry for yourself.according to elisabeth kubler-ross people need to go through\n                  these emotions and i think in a sense humanity is going through\n                  these emotions with respect to the loss of mother earth that is\n                  why it is so important now to kind of passionately use\n                  whatever means we can to address that question about what we\n                  can do and i think there are really solutions so there is acceptance then the disciple of creativity enlightenment empowerment joy and transcendence and then there is the transcendent gaia meredith really ought to be here to interpret it but this\n                  priest here holding the sword he is laying down\n                  his weapons his battle weapons and by the way we have the\n                  excalibur sword here we are going to do a ceremony tomorrow\n                  morning with that to set the stage for camelot.so and there is the resurrected gaia so this is kind of the symbolism of what we were working on\n                  for years oh i guess about ten years ago after i traveled\n                  and visited the free energy inventors.now one final thing and then i am going to hand it\n                  over to george we have had one workshop here so far it\n                  was called the phoenix gathering i do not know if you have\n                  ever heard of this group but there is a lot of phoenix\n                  stuff going on it was called the phoenix gathering these are visionaries that came in from all over the world and they were kind of randomly came they were self-selecting there was a dynamically facilitated very intensive workshop\n                  that lasted here for a week we had professional facilitators we had just lots of ideas thrown out there into the pot and the idea was through democratic discourse could we come\n                  up with a consensus and the answer was well yeah somewhat and\n                  i was trying to figure out why could not we come up with\n                  more of a consensus of course you could say the three-letter\n                  word ego but what i was able to observe  because i spent most the\n                  time observing this not participating quite so much although\n                  i was trying to promote free energy as a concept  but the\n                  group kind of were split about well ok what do we do\n                  about it there was one group that i would call the\n                    pragmatists and\n                  that was lead by a very articulate lawyer from new york city\n                  who really knew how to do a conference you know get a synopsis\n                  together a pr\u00e9cis like a legal brief very\n                  loud birdsong interrupts] thank you bird!so that was one of the pragmatists very practical\n                  people people that were probably more into bargaining right\n                  now saying well maybe solar will do it maybe obama will do it using existing\n                  systems and by the way i wrote a public appeal an open appeal to\n                  obama from a very concerned citizen about some of these questions that the kind of change he talks about change that\n                  his kind of change is more incremental and at most structural and what i am talking about is systemic change even going beyond well let us go back to the constitution let us restore the clinton-roosevelt-keynesian kind of\n                  plans to tinker with the system so we can have the good old\n                  days again get out of this depression that is what most people think about and that is\n                  what i might call structural change but that is\n                  not enough either it has to be systemic so whole\n                  new systems need to be defined so that is part of what we were trying to do at the phoenix\n                  gathering but it did not come to that what happened\n                  was that whenever a bold idea like free energy was presented\n                  to the pragmatists they said no nah you have got\n                  to prove it to me if there is one ready at k-mart i will\n                  go and pick it up for myself so those people were not really very useful in that kind\n                  of discussion and they are not they were kind of forced\n                  into that discussion because it was an intensive workshop so they had to put up with some of my blithering about it so those were the pragmatists.then there were what you would call the spiritualists these are people that see the big picture people that come\n                  from a very spiritual holistic perspective that would include like\n                  we had a couple of healers in the group and you know i really\n                  resonate with that as well these are people who are very very well they are\n                  quite accepting of these kinds of things but at the same time they are not very powerful politically and they are\n                  only part of the democratic process so they are the spiritualists.then there were the deep ecologists now these are\n                  the people that really thought the earth was ruined the sky\n                  was falling and by the way there is a tremendous amount\n                  of validity with each point of view i think.so we heard from the deep ecologists and one of\n                  them was so angry  but he is very angry about the state\n                  of the earth justifiably he is going through the anger\n                  phase of grief such that he steamed out of the conference he just exited just like that he was so angry he was just\n                  taking it out on you know the other people around there because it was pretty intimate you know it is 25 people we are sitting around a circle and interacting whatever.and then there was a fourth group ahh the truth-seekers now the pragmatists would call the truth-seekers paranoids or conspiracy theorists i call them the truth-seekers these\n                  are people that really want to know what is going on but you know it is really hard to know and as a trained\n                  scientist it is very hard i had great trouble putting\n                  up my own discriminator and being able to vet this or that\n                  idea and there were a lot of ideas thrown out there so it\n                  takes a great deal of study \u2013 why i need a research assistant anyway it takes a great deal of study to be able to effectively\n                  vet this or that concept well that is what truth-seeking is all about and i\n                  know that kerry and bill and george have all done wonderful\n                  jobs in trying to uncover the truth and that is going\n                  to be a theme a very important theme in this conference and i went away from the conference the phoenix gathering thinking well all four cultures are represented but very\n                  few of the people there represented more than one of those\n                  cultures and would not it be nice in a better world to\n                  bring them together and not to deny the existence of another\n                  culture it is like israel palestine i guess it is sort\n                  of like you have got to be able to embrace the other cultures that is one kind of nugget i came up with and i think\n                  as we come together in communities and by the way the most significant conclusion of the phoenix\n                  gathering was re-localization i mean that is the common\n                  denominator i think of just about any kind of sentient gathering\n                  that is going on these days it makes so much sense grow\n                  your own food just be local in everything form community barter local currency so forth and so on i love those ideas and it is not to deny them it is just that sometimes\n                  some of the other ideas fall through the cracks so in any\n                  kind of democratic discourse in the future it would be really\n                  good for people to learn to tolerate and understand the other\n                  cultures as well.and in a way i think i identify much more with indigenous\n                  cultures than i do with the western culture as we spend more\n                  and more time here in ecuador.anyway i thank you for you patience and i think i am\n                  going to give the floor over to george after a quick stretch\n                  break click\n                  here for\n                  the\n                  original\n                  audio there are people all over the earth that have had\n                  experiences similar to mine and we are all waiting for\n                  the right time to stand up in unity \u2013 in unity \u2013 and\n                  come forward and speak to the world and immediately this rush came over me i thought ahhhh this\n                    is it and he said have you ever worked for the\n                    cia or the fbi and of course i am 22 years old i do not want to have anything to do with this i am\n                    thinking why is this happening to me so what makes this fascinating is that as a child growing\n                  up my father on numerous occasions had told me a story of\n                  him being on the streets of paris during the war \u2013 because\n                  of course he is from europe \u2013 and how a man approached\n                  him and what my father said was that they asked him to become\n                  part of this psychic army the russian psychic army and he kept saying to me if they ever come to you do\n                    not go with them do you understand do not ever go\n                    with them because if you do they will own you i was shown an image of being in an underground base\n                  that what took place there was so dark and ugly and horrifying\n                  to me that it was difficult for me to deal with what are you doing here why cannot\n                    you just leave me alone and then i walked on board\n                    the craft the knowledge is that we are not alone that\n                  we are being watched that what we are doing is being\n                  looked upon by other beings that do have a certain amount of\n                  knowledge that we ourselves do not have i have seen the future through them with their assistance i believe that because we are being awakened\n                  to begin sharing this information with people that there are great\n                  changes that are coming and that we need to all understand\n                  that whether it was going to be a meteor hitting the earth or whether it was going to be war breaking out or whether\n                  it was going to be famine or there was going to be earth changes\n                  that took place \u2013 any of these things  that man had\n                  the ability to change this timeline of what it was that was\n                  going to be coming.kerry cassidy hi i am kerry cassidy\n                  from project camelot and we are here with miriam delicado and she is\n                  got a website called alienbluestar.com and she is got\n                  a very interesting story to tell she is a contactee and\n                  she has a special relationship with the hopi and the mayan\n                  peoples as we will see as we go forward hi miriam how are\n                  you today?m very well thank you thank you so\n                  much for having me kerry.k absolutely it is a real pleasure i have\n                  read your book it is a wonderful book and why do not\n                  you just start at the beginning whatever feels comfortable and tell the people your story and let us go from here.miriam delicado okay to start it is\n                  a very very big story and it is difficult for me to be\n                  able to convey to people the story of my life which is what\n                  i tried to do a little bit in my book blue star is\n                  give people an overview of many of the things that have happened\n                  to me i have had a very interesting past twenty\n                  years of my life where i have had numerous contacts with\n                  extraterrestrials from other places and often people have\n                  asked me where it is that these beings are from and that is\n                  a very big question so we will get into that in a little\n                  bit.but to give the viewers an overview you know my life started\n                  out very strange right from the very beginning and my life\n                  was not an ordinary one when i was growing up i first started\n                  to notice that i was different probably when i was about two\n                  years old and i actually have memories that could take me\n                  all the way back to being a baby as well as most of\n                  my remembering came back to me when i was about two so when i was probably about 9 years old my psychic abilities\n                  started to kick in and numerous strange things started to happen\n                  to me i was having very vivid dreams and all sorts of things\n                  along those lines that i really could not explain i used to play this little game when i was a child about\n                  watching the people in the cars as i was driving past\n                  them in a car and i would try to think of what they were saying\n                  or thinking in their heads and when i did that it was fascinating\n                  to me some of the things that i would hear them thinking about but at the same time i was always scared that they would know\n                  that i was you know probing into their minds and i never\n                  wanted to get caught doing that so that is a very very clear memory for me ever since\n                  i was very very young it is not something that i do\n                  now it is not something that i do consciously ever at any point because of course i would have to ask someone\u2019s\n                  permission in order to do that so right from the very beginning\n                  i was a little bit different.and as my life moved forward these abilities of mine just\n                  became stronger and stronger and by the time i was a teenager i was doing all sorts of things i was having dreams that were\n                  prophetic and you know to use terms that people would understand i saw a number of visions that actually came true within a\n                  very short period of time and i also had encounters with sort of beings that i was not clear with where\n                  they were from or what focus they where they came from and it was really unnerving for me growing up because even\n                  though i knew that my father had some sort of abilities as\n                  well i was not close enough to him to be able to talk\n                  to him about it and that made my earlier years very difficult just for that reason alone.now my father was an interesting character in my life because\n                  he seemed to possess certain abilities as well and when we\n                  were kids we were always you know a little bit nervous around\n                  him thinking that he would always know what we were doing.so when  jumping way forward into my life into the year\n                  1988 which is 20 years ago it was interesting when i did\n                  have this encounter on the highway in northern british columbia\n                  with extraterrestrials and this was a physical encounter that\n                  took place that changed my entire life but when it happened it was almost immediate that i knew\n                  that my father had had contact simply because a number\n                  of the things that i was told by these beings my father used\n                  to talk about when we were kids all the time  about how the\n                  world would eventually change and how we needed to learn how\n                  to survive and what it is that we needed to do this type\n                  of thing so i always knew that he had had contact.k did not he also work for the you know an agency a secret you know in intel in some capacity?m not that i am aware of.k because you talk about him being approached and\n                  he also warned you about being approached at some point is not\n                  that right?m yes k and how do you know that unless you know you have\n                  been approached m that was a very interesting story that my father\n                  used to tell me as a child it was a fascinating story that\n                  always you know made me really nervous and i had no clue\n                  as to what he was talking about so what i need to do is step\n                  forward past 1988.it was a couple of years later and i was working\n                  at a little yogurt shop and this is a really fascinating piece\n                  to this puzzle of my life and even i myself am still to this\n                  day made a little bit wary of it so the year was you know a couple of years\n                  after 1988 and i was working in this yogurt shop and i was\n                  just having a normal day or i was trying to and this man\n                  walked past the window of the shop and he looked directly at\n                  me into my eyes and when he did he came right in the door walked right up\n                  to me looked me straight in the eye and he said do you\n                  work for the cia or the fbi and i said no i do not and immediately this\n                  rush came over me and i thought ahhhh this is\n                  it and he said have you ever worked for the cia or the fbi and of course i am 22 years old i do not want to\n                  have anything to do with this i am thinking why\n                  is this happening to me i said no i have not and then he proceeded to tell me he said have\n                  you ever thought about working for the russians and of course i said absolutely not and he then proceeded to tell me how the russians had been\n                  working with people like myself for a very long time and that\n                  if i joined them that i would never be alone again that i\n                  would be surrounded with people that were like me and i said\n                  i was not interested.and what he was talking about was the psychic program and\n                  he said that the psychic program had been going on for a very\n                  long time and of course i knew all about this and i very\n                  nicely politely with a smile on my face looked at this man\n                  and said that i was not interested and he kept pushing and saying do you know how strong\n                    you are and i smiled at him i said yes i do know how strong\n                  i am and he said but can you control your abilities and i said actually i can and then he said that they would still be very much interested\n                  in working with me and i told them that there was no way i said what i would like you to do is go back to the people\n                  that sent you here thank them very much for their interest\n                  and tell then that there is no point in ever coming back\n                  because i will never be interested so what makes this fascinating is that as a child growing\n                  up my father on numerous occasions had told me a story of\n                  him being on the streets of paris during the war \u2013 because\n                  of course he is from europe \u2013 and how a man approached\n                  him and what my father said was that they asked him to become\n                  part of this psychic army the russian psychic army and he kept saying to me if they ever come to you do\n                    not go with them do you understand do not ever go\n                    with them because if you do they will own you you\n                    cannot run and you cannot hide because they will\n                    find you with their minds and so of course i was always very frightened by this and\n                  it did not make any sense to me growing up but in that\n                  moment as soon as the man walked into the store and said do\n                  you work for the cia or the fbi i knew exactly who he\n                  was what he was there to ask me and i was very adamant that\n                  i was not interested and i am not interested for anyone to\n                  do something along those lines.k okay yeah i remember that story from your book\n                  and i think it is a real bell-ringer i think your father\n                  had what maybe native american blood somewhere in there he is certainly got i do not know european what\n                  would you say your background is just in terms of genetics i guess?m my mother is german and as far as i know all the\n                  way back she is german my father is yugoslavian and as far as i know his family history going far like\n                  way way way back i believe that there is some interesting\n                  blood there but for me to say anything for certain would not\n                  be fair to him or to anyone because i am not sure but as far as native american blood goes no i do not\n                  believe that there is but with his bloodline if there is\n                  anyone interested in looking it up that would be able to go\n                  very far back meaning you know even thousands of years i think that it would be fascinating to see where it led.k okay so let us go to your incident in 1988\n                  and tell a little more about that kind of capsulate it if\n                  you will.m in 1988 i was living a very normal average life\n                  as a young adult i had just moved from a small town into\n                  the big city in vancouver british columbia and my friends\n                  and i had decided to take a road trip to my home town and\n                  on the way up there everything was normal we took the drive\n                  and everything was fine but on the return journey everything everything changed.there were four of us four adults and a young child in the\n                  car and the trip we were driving for hours i was sleeping\n                  in the back seat of the car and then it started to get dark\n                  out the people that were driving wanted a break so they went\n                  into the back seat and i went up into the front into the\n                  passenger side with my friend and right away these big balls\n                  of light they looked like truck lights actually that is\n                  what we thought that they were for the longest time came\n                  streaming up behind us rather quickly in the car and as that\n                  happened we were wondering why they were traveling so fast.now these particular lights followed us for hours and hours\n                  in the darkness and every time we came up to a car or any\n                  kind of house or buildings at all the lights would fall back\n                  and disappear so after hours of this going on eventually we went through\n                  a town where we thought for sure that we had lost the lights and as soon as we got to the other side of this town into\n                  the forested area the absolute moment we said okay we are\n                  clear there is no way they can catch up with us and\n                  literally in the blink of an eye there they were these balls\n                  of light that were probably about this big holds hands about\n                  12 inches apart]and they came up behind us and then \u2013 poof  and at\n                  this point after hours they had been appearing and disappearing appearing and disappearing and in the blink of an eye so\n                  my friend got very very nervous as i did neither one of\n                  us were comfortable with what was happening at all and the\n                  people in the back seat were still sleeping.so all of a sudden i screamed at her and i said pull\n                    over the car right now it is not you they want it is\n                    me and i went to grab the steering wheel to pull her\n                    over when all of a sudden she just sort of flopped you\n                    know like a raggedy ann doll flopped her head over and\n                    started pulling over and stopped at the side of the road and by that time the car filled with light from every direction and these balls of light were sitting behind the car so at\n                  that point  i was the only one conscious at that time \n                  when i turned from the back of the car to the front i saw\n                  a craft on the road now i could not make out any detail because it looked\n                  almost misty and very very bright and these beings that were\n                  about four feet tall walked were walking towards me they were very androgynous almost childlike in their nature and they had big round black eyes they did not\n                  have any oval eyes at all these were round black eyes and they were directing me to get out of the car which i\n                  did and i was very scared i was not terrified though and that distinction needs to be made i was not terrified i was scared so i got out of the car they led me down the highway a little\n                  bit and at this point i was not even thinking about my\n                  friends i was just wondering where they were taking me.and on this embankment on the left they led me up the\n                  embankment where i saw when i looked up a larger craft that\n                  had two beings standing in this doorway and they had blond\n                  hair  and i mean blond as in snow white hair  and the most\n                  brilliant blue mediterranean water blue eyes that you have\n                  ever seen and quite incredible and the beings the short\n                  ones took me to the craft and when i got to the doorway i\n                  walked onboard the craft but what was interesting was that just prior to all of this\n                  happening i had had a dream in the back seat of the car and in this dream that i had this man and woman told me they\n                  said we are coming for you soon do not be afraid we\n                  are your friends we are your family do not be afraid and then when i saw these two tall beings the moment that\n                  i laid eyes on them i said in my mind what are you doing\n                  here why cannot you just leave me alone and then\n                  i walked onboard the craft.k and did you have any memories of what happened on\n                  the craft at that point?m from the moment i walked off that craft i had very\n                  clear memories and i have had those clear memories for twenty\n                  years.k clear memories of what happened on the craft or just clear memories up to the point you have told us?m both once i was onboard the craft i remember a\n                  great deal of what happened to me i do not by any means remember\n                  the full three hours i do not and i do not know\n                  if i ever will or not because up to this point i mean i have not had hypnosis done to recover memories so that is\n                  a very important point for me to make to anyone watching is\n                  that these memories have come from conscious memories so in other words i walked onto the craft i had this encounter it took me some time but i did come to realize that it was\n                  a total of three hours it was very clear math that i did to\n                  work this out so there was three hours of missing time and\n                  i remember quite a bit of the information that they gave me\n                  at that time.there were ah there were things that have stayed\n                  with me so clearly that even as i am looking at you i\n                  can still see the images in my mind every time i hear about you\n                  know k can you give us an idea what was conveyed to you\n                  at that time and does that have something to do with what\n                  you are doing here now visiting sedona and hopiland the four corners area?m it has everything to do with it twenty years ago\n                  i was given messages and these messages and information that\n                  i was given were so crystal clear to me that two days after\n                  i walked off the craft i had a clear understanding of all of\n                  my psychic abilities and where they came from and how i had\n                  them and why i had them i had a great understanding of my father that i had never\n                  had before in my life i knew that he had had contact i had a clear understanding that there were many other people\n                  in the world that were like myself and that all of these things\n                  were related.and after two days i started writing quite a bit of this down i did not by any means write it all down but there\n                  were key points that i did put on paper now at the time even\n                  with some of them i did not understand the full extent of\n                  what it was in this information but it was about the four\n                  corners area as being one of the \u201csafe lands in\n                  what they termed the end times  if these end times came in\n                  the form that they were giving warnings about so they gave me warnings about possible futures in which the\n                  planet could potentially have destruction and the people could\n                  potentially have a very difficult time.now these warnings were just possibilities but they were\n                  things that they had made very clear to me crystal clear to\n                  me that humanity had a choice in whether or not we were going\n                  to end up on this destructive path or a positive path so many of these things were told to me twenty years ago but getting into it a little bit deeper they also told me\n                  a great deal about the four corners area in particular.so of course i did not at that time as i was still trying\n                  to process all of this information truly understand what it\n                  was that they were saying how this particular area was a \u201csafe\n                  land and how at this time there were certain people\n                  that would gather together in this area the four corners area is a really important area to these\n                  beings and it is because it is one of the center points on\n                  the earth where gatherings will take place for many people and it does not necessarily mean that everyone needs to pack\n                  up leave and go to the four corners area because it is\n                  a \u201csafe land what it means is that even if an individual travels through\n                  the area they are going to be able to have information coming\n                  to them within their own selves in order to assist them and\n                  help them to know where it is they need to be on the planet.if there is a great cataclysm that does take place there are certain areas on the earth that will be in safe zones but that does not mean that you are going to be able\n                  to go there and be taken care of what it means is that these\n                  areas will not have that great destruction but it still will\n                  be in chaos so that needs to be clarified to everyone and\n                  that there are these particular safe spots and safe lands all\n                  over the earth.now the indigenous people all over the earth have known these\n                  things for thousands of years and they are the ones that have\n                  all of this knowledge as to where all of these particular areas\n                  are and if we take a look at their myth stories we are going\n                  to be able to find that information and at the same time this has been guarded by them for thousands\n                  of years so that if we needed the information it would be\n                  made public for everyone so it is really important the\n                  hopi as well as others on the planet play a part in this now there needs to be some very clear understanding here\n                  about what i am going to say because i do have friends\n                  that are in hopi and i have talked to people there but by\n                  no means at all am i a spokesperson for them or do i speak\n                  on their behalf whatsoever.so what i am going to do is i am going to share\n                  my experience with you i am not going to talk about hopi i am going to share my experiences that revolve around\n                  them.k maybe you can tell us where the link up came you\n                  were told by these beings in 1988 somehow i assume this is\n                  when you were also told to come to hopi at some point there\n                  was also some kind of a i do not know if it was a stone\n                  or a necklace or something that you had and you buried in\n                  your back yard do you want to share that story before we kind\n                  of move into the bigger picture?m yes the relationship between these beings and the\n                  hopi for example again this is only from my experiences and it is fascinating even to me it is fascinating when i was onboard the craft i was sitting in what i call\n                  a \u201clight chair and it was you could look\n                  at it just like this points to the chair she is sitting\n                  on except instead of it being a chair it was made from\n                  pure light so it almost glowed and i sat in this chair and\n                  i looked across the room and i had a being on either side\n                  of me and a screen popped up and the screen was actually\n                  quite large it was probably about this as large as\n                  the chair and you know two or three feet high and as i looked\n                  at the screen there was information that came across it and\n                  images these images would be accompanied by information that was\n                  given to me by these beings either through telepathy or \n                  meaning they would directly speak to me  or it felt like\n                  there was just a constant flow of information being sort of\n                  placed within my mind now one of the things that they shared with me was the creation\n                  of man and this is very much related to the hopi and all of\n                  the indigenous people and ourselves so to make this story really short they explained that they\n                  had a hand in creating mankind but by no means were they god that they were the helpers of this earth to insure that they\n                  were overseers so that they would be here to watch over the\n                  earth to help man become more than what they currently are so in the beginning life was created but nothing came of\n                  it so they it is like saying that they threw\n                  the seeds of life across the land just to see what would come\n                  up and the idea was that a vessel would be made so that the\n                  sparks of life  us  could then enter and experience life\n                  in this world but nothing ever came of it in the second world they gave this life more form but still\n                  thought that it would evolve into something more and again\n                  nothing of any real value was produced in the third world that they created and again these\n                  are the things that were shown and told to me and in the third\n                  world they said that the form  meaning our bodies  were\n                  created and then our souls would come into the bodies and\n                  when they did we had all this knowledge we had all this ability\n                  to communicate with one another we had telepathy we had an\n                  understanding far beyond what we currently do right now.but it was like giving children matches to play with without\n                  allowing them to evolve more along the lines of emotionally and to be able to handle all of this knowledge so they kind\n                  of went crazy they played around too much they were becoming\n                  destructive and the things that they did were very dark and\n                  evil at that point so again the world was sort of cleaned out cleaned off and\n                  again these new vessels were created  meaning the vessels\n                  that we have now so there is been a slow evolution of \u201cmankind over\n                  time.as this took place one of the things that happened was in\n                  this third world i was shown an image of these people and\n                  it was sort of like looking from above and i looked down into\n                  this room and i saw these people and these people i was told were living the life that was intended which was the spiritual\n                  life and so because they had this great knowledge and because\n                  they had a\u00a0 true understanding of why they were here and\n                  the bodies that they had seemed to be doing very well they\n                  were spared and taken from the third world and brought into\n                  this the fourth world.now one of the things that happened in this vision is i was\n                  told that one day i would find these people and i would know\n                  what to do so when i went into the four corners area for the very first\n                  time in 2003 i knew i had to go through hopi but i really\n                  did not know why the only thing i knew was that there\n                  was a reason for this and it was a very big reason and it\n                  was very very important so when i did go through hopi i had what i would call a \u201cpsychic\n                  flash where i saw some of these hopi people and they\n                  changed right in front of my eyes and it was in this flash\n                  that i had all of the visions that were given to me onboard\n                  the craft as well as what they wanted me to do as well as\n                  what was happening on the earth where we came from where\n                  we are going it was just mind blowing it was so much but most important i realized that these were the people that they wanted me to\n                  find i realized that the hopi were these individuals that\n                  were taken \u2013 \u201cindividuals meaning people\n                   that were taken from the third world into the fourth world and that they had a great purpose at this time so it was no surprise to me that i came across them at all and their role on the planet is very important for the future\n                  of everyone.it is my hope and i hope with my heart that all of us \n                  meaning the hopi the indigenous from all around the world and everyone else that has an understanding and a caring and\n                  a passion and a desire to help this planet  will truly come\n                  together and be able to save us from this destructive path\n                  that i was shown.k you came to hopi though and it was an interesting\n                  sort of series of events that put you there and then also and\n                  i do not know this may encompass beyond 2003 but\n                  your experience of meeting and i do not know his\n                  name he is an hopi elder i believe and you ended up\n                  staying at his house do you want to tell a little of that story because its kind\n                  of it is really compelling in the sense that\n                  here you are a complete stranger a white woman walking into\n                  this tribal setting and in some strange way they seem to have\n                  accepted you and welcomed you in.m in 2004 i took a trip again by myself and during\n                  this particular journey i knew before i even went there what\n                  was going to happen and i was very nervous on the first trip i bought a ring at a little store in hopi and i went back there in 2004 and talked to the woman that\n                  sold me the ring and i was trying to tell her some of these\n                  things that had happened to me and the way that i talked about\n                  it was i kept telling her i had these visions or i\n                  had these dreams and how i came to all this information and\n                  she was really taken aback by the things that i was saying and she said to me i think you should speak to one of\n                    our elders so she hummed and hawed about who she should\n                    send me to and then she told me go to this mesa this is\n                    where this person is this is their name and i was thinking oh wow this is it i knew this\n                  was going to happen so i go up onto the mesa and i find this man and he was not\n                  very impressed that i was at his door initially and he was\n                  kind of humming and hawing like what are you doing here i\n                  cannot help you and i said no i am only here to share this with\n                    you that is it so i again started this amazing story about how i had these\n                  visions and dreams about certain things and how i found them\n                  to be completely related to hopi prophecies and that they\n                  were not just related they were almost \u2013 almost\n                   identical in their nature and the story of their\n                  creation story again exactly the same as what these tall\n                  blond entities and beings had told me so i was telling him all of this and then finally he looked\n                  at me and he said wait a minute are you talking about he\n                  kind of leaned across the table and said are you talking\n                  about aliens?and i thought ahhhh it was such a relief it was such a relief in that moment because i had to wait for\n                  him to bring it up and i said yes and he said okay okay now talk to me now tell me this story so i continued talking to him and he appeared to understand\n                  and know what it was that i was talking to him about and at\n                  that point you know after i had been speaking to him for\n                  hours he looked at me and he said why are you here and i said i am here to share with you and he said no why are you here i do not understand and\n                  he was just kind of shaky about it and i said well i am only here to share this story\n                  with you and he said you know i have had people come from all\n                  over the world he has himself as well as hopis they\n                  have people come from all over the world and he said they come with similar stories but not like\n                  this he said all of them come here and they ask\n                  me questions and you have not asked me a single question why and i said what could i possibly ask you that i do not\n                  already have the answer to so that made him even more nervous and it is not because\n                  i believe that i have all of the answers it is because i know\n                  that for myself i do not need a hopi to tell me something i know what i need to know and i am content with that.now what happened after being with him for some time is even\n                  more fascinating because i left at one point he asked me\n                  to leave because someone came to his home and i walked out\n                  of his house and i walked along the mesa at which time i\n                  started walking towards the hopi woman\u2019s home who sold\n                  me the ring she told me where she lived her daughter was\n                  outside so i started talking and sitting with her daughter and very quickly after that she started speaking hopi to one\n                  of her friends and i think it was that moment that i said\n                  to myself that is it there is absolutely not an\n                  ounce of questioning left anymore because in that moment\n                  she said a word in hopi that i recognized as being one of the\n                  words that these tall blond aliens spoke to me and i asked\n                  the little girl i said what does that mean and\n                  she said it is thank you saying thank you to a woman\n                  in hopi and i said wow that is amazing so the two of us were walking around for a little while and\n                  i went in to get a pop from this little place something to\n                  drink and when i was in this area i all of a sudden heard\n                  in my head what are you doing here very clearly as if someone was standing right beside me and when i looked to my right at this long counter there\n                  standing at the counter was one of these beings blond hair blue eyes they are probably about i do not know 6 4 built as if they were you know had been\n                  working out for their entire lives  just really really strong\n                  looking and he stared at me and said what are you doing here and i again said well i am coming home what are\n                  you doing here you know why are you asking me type of thing and there was no conversation with him but i knew who he\n                  was completely and i wanted to walk up to him and say oh what are you doing here let us sit down and talk but\n                  again i just kept walking with this little girl thinking no it is not the right time i was walking out of this area and i said to the little girl did\n                    you see that man in there yeah i said did you recognize him she said no i have never seen him before and i said okay so i thought wow that is so\n                  strange there is something about that that i had like to\n                  share that is not in the book which is fascinating that\n                  has to do with this but to continue i went back to this elder\u2019s home and\n                  when i did i said to him this is what happened when i\n                  was with the little girl i heard this word being said as one\n                  of these words that these beings spoke to me in so there i was sitting at this elder\u2019s table and out\n                  of my back pocket i pulled out a piece of paper and i opened\n                  it up and i said this is the language that they spoke\n                  to me in and i pushed the piece of paper over to him so he tried to i said they are all phonetically written because\n                  i did not know how to write this and he said well why do not you just tell me what\n                  the words are so i read them out and as i did at least 6 of the words\n                  on the piece of paper were hopi one for sure i know for sure is navajo and he told me that other words that were on this\n                  piece of paper that he thought were navajo words so these beings in 1988 when i had never had\n                  any exposure to hopis or navajos in any way shape or form as a 22-year-old young girl living a very normal life these\n                  beings spoke to me in a language that i knew for twenty years\n                  at this point today i knew all that time that one day i would\n                  find the people whose language this belonged to i just did not\n                  expect them to be hopis i always thought that i had find\n                  them in the jungles of south america or something so this being that i saw in the mesa what happened\n                  after that trip in 2004 when i returned home was i went for\n                  dinner with a friend of mine and i was telling him all about\n                  my journey and that type of thing we took a drive in his car him and his wife were in the front seat and in the back seat\n                  i was sitting behind the driver and his nine-year-daughter\n                  was to the right of me so as we are driving down a very busy street in vancouver very busy street one of the major streets a jeep rolls up\n                  beside the car and as it does i looked and there sitting\n                  in the car was this blond being blond-haired blue-eyed being that was sitting and completely head cocked to the one\n                  side and looking at me directly without looking at the road\n                  at all did not look at the road at all just sat there\n                  and with his head just stared at me and i thought no\n                  way that is all i could think but here\u2019s the great thing the little girl said oh\n                    my god look at that man he looks so weird he does not\n                    even look human m everyone in the car just sat back and thought you\n                  know was quickly trying to get a glimpse of this man and\n                  so then again there i was having confirmation by another\n                  individual of all of these things and during a two-week period after i returned from that trip i had three encounters like that one in a store one on the\n                  public transit bus and then the one in the car with my friends very strange very very strange even to me it is fascinating.k okay maybe we could just kind of move ahead now\n                  to a little more current and what you have been hearing and maybe share a little bit about the fact that you have how\n                  you have began to come forward and especially how you\n                  got to write your book.because i have to say that i came across you via i\n                  think i heard you on a radio show briefly and then i saw your\n                  site i saw your face and i knew instantly that we should\n                  talk and it was a drawing of your face it was not actually\n                  you but i just had a connection and i just knew but the\n                  book then i got the book and that just confirmed what\n                  i had thought so can you tell me about the writing of\n                  the book?m big question very important question and especially\n                  relevant for today the whole purpose behind writing this book was first\n                  of all it was a request made by them so in 1988 when i was\n                  onboard that craft i was actually asked by them to do this they asked me to come forward and share this story to tell\n                  people who they were and where they were from so that if and\n                  when the time came that if they had to make their presence\n                  known on a global scale that we would not be afraid so this was very important to them this was the whole purpose\n                  for them sharing the knowledge that they did with me and helping\n                  me to try to understand the earth to understand ourselves and to understand them the reason that it was written at this time was i\n                  have to give you a bit of a timeline in 1988 i had what i\n                  call my awakening encounter and that is the point where everything\n                  sort of stems from i always revert back to 1988 when i am\n                  describing to people what has happened.so i am told in 1988 all of these things and asked to\n                  share them so i started doing some of these things that they had\n                  asked of me and then all of a sudden they said no no no stop stop stop stop quiet quiet quiet no more talking and i knew that eventually one day i would be told when the\n                  right time was to come forward and start sharing this .so at the very beginning of 2003 i was sort of woke up one\n                  morning they said okay it is time it is time it is time to go to the four corners area  whatever\n                  that meant i was not sure but it was time for me to what\n                  i would say for lack of a better term to start my work so\n                  that happened in 2003 and after that of course encounter\n                  with the hopi elder and as well as a number of other things\n                  that happened prior to that in the four corners area that were\n                  related to 1988 i said okay i must start writing so\n                  the process began.then in 2007 near the beginning of the year i had quite\n                  a few messages given to me in many different forms they came\n                  to me in dreams they came to me you know in my head saying you\n                  need to finish the book you need to finish the book you need\n                  to finish the book and they told me that it was very important that i had it\n                  done by november and i really did not know why but they\n                  said november 2007 i had to have the book done by because\n                  there was a timeline of what was going to be taking place on\n                  the planet so i pushed and pushed and pushed myself in many ways to be\n                  able to have this task completed which just under the wire i have done so the book was done i finished writing it and\n                  then i was told to begin sharing this story with whomever would\n                  listen now i was told in 1988 that i was to find the others like\n                  myself and that we were to come together and that these gatherings\n                  would begin now they have given me information and that again starts to step into what i believe has to do with the indigenous\n                  people of the earth because of what these beings told me and\n                  they said that in the \u201cend times that there would\n                  be many changes that would take place so they are\n                  on many different levels they are not just one and it is\n                  not simple to describe these things.i was told that one of them would be on a spiritual level changes would begin to take place on a physical level changes\n                  would begin and also on an earth basis for the earth itself that changes would happen so all of these things were sort of being correlated and being\n                  written by humanity itself in the path that we are to take for example that there were the possibility that war would\n                  break out for example this is something that really disturbs\n                  me it scares me it upsets me and even as i say this i could\n                  cry because and i might just cry voice breaks choked\n                  up]k it is okay go ahead.m because if anyone were to have lived the life that\n                  i have for the past twenty years to have had the experience\n                  after experience after experience confirmation after confirmation\n                  after confirmation of all of these things they too would\n                  not hesitate in anything to help in whatever way they could\n                  to stop this process because we have a responsibility as human beings i\n                  was told that we have a responsibility to do what we can to\n                  save this earth we are not the saviors of the\n                  earth we are supposed to be the caretakers of\n                  the earth we are here to be the stewards of this land that is part of why we are here to be able to experience one\n                  another and the earth itself but the way that we are living our lives based in things\n                  like greed as being the primary focus for most people we have\n                  forgotten about why it is that we are supposed to be here to\n                  begin with and that is the beauty of each other and of this\n                  land.and one of the things that i always ask people every single\n                  person and i say to them you really need to ask yourself\n                  this question are you happy it is a very simple\n                  question the answer is what gets very complicated because as it was explained to me by these beings humanity\n                  was on a path a collision course and if we did not change\n                  it this was going to be the end result destruction in whatever form whether it was going to be a meteor\n                  hitting the earth or whether it was going to be war breaking\n                  out or whether it was going to be famine or there was going\n                  to be earth changes that took place  any of these things\n                   that man had the ability to change this timeline of what\n                  is was that was going to be coming now people have said to me well you are trying\n                    to create a prophecy or you are talking about prophecy but here\u2019s the thing for anyone out there that understands\n                  even remotely the smallest amount of this this is easy to\n                  understand what it is that is happened here we have\n                  been given a gift a very special gift and that is the gift\n                  of seeing beyond where we currently are now if we stay on the same path they have said this\n                  is going to be the end result but the gift is if we can change\n                  the course that we have been on then all of these things will\n                  be averted and they will not happen so this is the reason for the book this is the reason that\n                  i have come forward because i do not want to be talking\n                  to you i really do not i wish i could put on a mask\n                  and not be here but i am because in my heart in my mind in my entire being i know that we are on a path that is frightening and some people get scared i am not scared these tears\n                  are not fear these tears are very much sadness because i\n                  have seen the future through them with their assistance so\n                  i hope that we will be able to come together as humanity to\n                  change that and i believe i believe that we still\n                  can i do not think that it is possible at this point\n                  in time to stop everything i think that we have come to a\n                  time where it has become apparent and is becoming more apparent\n                  every day that we are on a collision course in many different\n                  areas our food supplies have in the course of the last year become\n                  scarce in certain areas in the world things like rice mad\n                  cow disease the avian flu the list goes on these things\n                  are all becoming apparent to everyone in the world fuel \n                  the cost of fuel gas prices affecting everyone in the world but all of these things can be changed very easily and that\n                  is how we are going to change the earth  with helping one\n                  another.k okay so you have a mission and you are on your\n                  mission and here we are this is october actually not october this is september of 2008 right and it is a beautiful\n                  world outside my door today however there are a lot of things\n                  going on right now as we speak the american economy is going\n                  in the tank there is possible war with iran right you know behind our backs could be happening could be gearing up and\n                  there are other things as well so how is this impacting your\n                  sense of what you are doing what your sort of your\n                  set mission and what the next milestones are if you will that you are planning to get to?m considering that this is 2008 that is a very\n                  interesting question for me because it has been i do not\n                  even know how many years and i do not even know if it\n                  relates back to 1988 but at some point in this course\n                  of my life in the last twenty years 2008 has been a year that\n                  has stuck with me because i have known for years that between august\n                  of 2008 and november 2008 that there would be major changes\n                  on the earth and what i mean is i am not talking\n                  about changes of the earth itself but of the people and maybe in some form it would have something to do with the\n                  united states now i made this very public statement in january of this\n                  year i said that these things were coming and that they would\n                  involve the united states and what the united states did and what happened here would affect the entire world forever so considering that the american economy is doing as it is and the price of oil that does have to do with the united states\n                  in part there are we are at the beginning of a flow\n                  that is not going to be easily rectified if at all so what people need to understand is that these things were\n                  told to me years and years and years ago and so what i am\n                  saying is that 2008 there is going to be economic repercussions\n                  across the earth that are never going to be fully recovered so that is the first change i have also seen that there are the possibilities of changes\n                  taking place on a global scale of things that are more geared\n                  towards the political structure of the earth in the next probably\n                  4 to 6 months that there were going to be some changes\n                  that were going to be taking place around this time so that\n                  finishes off 2008 it is like a precursor to what is\n                  to come now the other year that i am concerned with and i have\n                  had great concern over since 1988 is not 2012 as people have\n                  often asked me 2012 to myself in the knowledge that i have\n                  been given by these beings is not a specific date for me to\n                  be even thinking about however the year 2010 is so what is coming in 2010 i am\n                  often asked this and all i know is that there is the potential\n                  of great destruction all over the earth can i say that that is\n                  war no i will not say that can i say that it is a meteor\n                  coming i cannot say that what i am saying is that humanity\n                  has a role to play in how this turns out in 2010.so let us say that 2010 rolls around and nothing happens you know what i am not going to sit here and say oh i\n                  was wrong i am going to be clapping in glee that we have\n                  averted what it is that i have seen for all this time so it is never too late the eleventh hour is going to be\n                  the eleventh hour until the moment that it happens so we always\n                  have time we always have the ability to change something and i believe that from all of this knowledge that\n                  i have learned and all of these things that have been\n                  shown to me i know that we have the ability to work together\n                  to make changes on the earth that are going to be lasting that will bring back the happiness and joy that we came here\n                  to be able to experience that we will put a structure\n                  in place for our families and our communities that is geared\n                  towards caring for one another and for the earth itself.and this particular time that we are in right now it\n                  is critical that we begin to understand that we need to take\n                  responsibility on an individual basis that we as individuals do have\n                  the power to change the earth in a way that is going to be\n                  beneficial to our children in a way that is going to be beneficial\n                  to the people that are coming after us and people ask me why is it and what is it that makes\n                    this time special and it is because we are being given\n                    the choice the choice of how our path is going to lead us\n                    and take us and where the end is going to be if we decide that we are going to continue to be greed-filled look\n                  into the future it does not take much you can see that\n                  there is no real way out of this situation that we are\n                  in unless we make some changes so how do we do that how do\n                  we make changes and i tell people  very important people that come here\n                  to project camelot it is a prime example it is\n                  called education the most important thing that an individual\n                  can do is educate themselves and i am not talking just about political issues or issues\n                  that have to do with extraterrestrials but i am talking\n                  about educate yourself as to who you are as a person educate\n                  yourself as to how to live how to build a home how to grow\n                  food put your hands in the earth again so that you remember\n                  who you are so that you remember where your food came from that is education.it is talking about educating yourself in all the areas\n                  that you need  spiritually emotionally physically look\n                  at how you are living the choices that you are making no one including myself are perfect no one\u2019s perfect but what we can do is when we are able to we can make the\n                  right choices so that slowly we can make a world that is on\n                  the right path.k okay so you come here though to hopiland and sedona\n                  and the four corners and the mission is to gather the people as i understand it.m yes.k and this is not just the native american people and can you talk about that a little?m i am going to share with you a little bit of what\n                  was told to me twenty years ago when i was onboard the craft what i was told was to find the others like myself to gather\n                  them together and bring them back to the safe lands that a\n                  time would come when all of these people  meaning the people\n                  that i saw living from the taken from the third world\n                  into the fourth world and as well as the others \u201clike\n                  myself that we would all come back together and\n                  when this happened there would be great changes that would\n                  take place on the earth for the better.so it is becoming clearer and clearer to me by the day now see it used to take years for things to come and that is\n                  no longer the case and that is a very key point because\n                  people have noticed that the world and the daily lives that\n                  they have everything\u2019s changing  the way that we think the way that we act some people just seem to be floating through\n                  life while other people are just sort of going crazy and they\n                  cannot seem to hold their own selves and their own space.what is happening now is that this gathering that i was\n                  told about 20 years ago is beginning to form and the people\n                  like myself are there are people all over the earth\n                  that have had experiences similar to mine and we are all waiting\n                  for the right time to stand up in unity  in unity \n                  and come forward and speak to the world because when the world\n                  realizes that we are here and that we are strong and that\n                  we have been working in our own individual ways to better the\n                  earth and to better our societies i believe that they will\n                  not have a choice but to look around and say okay what\n                  do we need to do?because we are not crazy people people like myself are\n                  living very normal lives and as i state in the book we could\n                  be your best friend or your neighbor we could be the principal\n                  at the school we could be your governor or anything in life you could even be married to somebody like me and you may not\n                  know but when the time comes all of us will stand up together and come out of these closets that we have been living\n                  in to make our presence known on a global scale.so when people talk about this time where they are constantly\n                  asking me are these beings going to show themselves to\n                  us are they going to come out on a global scale i tell\n                  them that it is my understanding that these tall blond beings\n                  are here as the caretakers of this earth and that they will\n                  not show themselves on a global scale en mass unless\n                  it is absolutely necessary to do so \u2013 meaning if there\n                  was some great cataclysm that was coming where the entire world\n                  would be wiped out that they would then step in but it is\n                  only then that they would do so.now we  people like myself  are the ones that could come\n                  out on a global basis and a global scale and this is one of\n                  the questions i have been asked so many times and this\n                  is a really important point for people to understand that\n                  when they say they are going to come out well yeah we are\n                  going to come out we are going to come out of your homes and out of your schools and out of your political arenas and out of your preschools as your teachers that is where\n                  we are going to come out first.k and does not it also there is a\n                  really key ingredient which involves the children and that\n                  the gatherings are actually going to send sort of a wave across\n                  the planet that is going to impact and stimulate all of\n                  the indigo children and all of the crystal children  whatever\n                  you want to call them  and they will suddenly know that the\n                  time is now because of this gathering if i understand it.m you do understand it very well and it is important\n                  to note that also when these gatherings take place and they\n                  have been you know one can say that these gatherings\n                  have been taking place all over the earth already in small\n                  forms what the great gathering is is certain individuals certain\n                  groups coming together of prominence and of \u2013 \u201cprominence meaning\n                  nothing more than having certain knowledge so people all over\n                  the earth with certain knowledge will come together and when\n                  they stand together they will say certain things and what\n                  it is going to do is it is going to send a message\n                  out to individuals children to young adults to you know those people that are 70 years old but it will send a message to everyone that is waiting waiting we all feel it everyone\u2019s felt it for a very\n                  long time what are we waiting for it is like sitting\n                  in a chair getting all jittery what are we waiting for we are\n                  waiting for something one of the things that they are waiting for is for this\n                  event to take place that is what i believe because that is\n                  what i was told 20 years ago that it would be a wave that\n                  would sort of go out to these individuals and almost send a\n                  message to them and say okay you are not alone let us wake up together and let us start standing\n                  up and be known en mass to the earth because then there\n                  will be responsibility taken by individuals but it will also mean that those people that are living in\n                  their homes in fear of coming out that as we come out together we will no longer be ridiculed by people but we will be we\n                  will have individuals saying okay teach me a little bit\n                  more about this path that you are on because there is more than one side to this phenomenon and i am not here to talk to people or educate them about\n                  the darker side what i am saying is that this knowledge this path this understanding that i have from these tall blonds is truly about enlightening ourselves to educating ourselves to helping us to understand who we are and where we are\n                  from and there is no hidden agenda.we may not have all of the answers i may not have all of\n                  the answers but if you put me in a room with a number of other\n                  people we do have the whole picture so to say that there is\n                  other things going on is not a fair assessment in my view so it is important for all of us to come together to\n                  the earth en mass and that will be happening i hope\n                  very soon.k okay now we have time for you\n                  to ask your question and then we can also double back and cover\n                  some ground that we might have missed along the way okay?bill ryan i have a question which many people who are\n                  watching this would probably want me to ask and that is that when you talk about the four worlds that were mentioned both\n                  by your extraterrestrials contacts and that are present in\n                  the hopi legend in the same form can you match that against\n                  the traditional scientific thinking in terms of the fossil\n                  record the evolution of man can you put any kind of a date\n                  on this what does this actually mean to a paleontologist or\n                  an anthropologist are you able to answer that question or\n                  is it just not known?m that is an interesting question to me because the\n                  way that i can explain this is that when i was onboard the\n                  craft i was given knowledge it was like saying that i had\n                  an education in many areas okay one of the areas was on the\n                  evolution of man and where we came from where we are\n                  going so in this it was as though i went to let us\n                  say grade three or grade four so i have only a little bit\n                  of knowledge about these different worlds i am not the expert but i know that there is others like myself out there\n                  who would have far greater in-depth knowledge concerning this\n                  question what became very clear to me in the visions that i was shown\n                  on the screen was that for example in the beginning they\n                  said that it was like they threw the seeds of life across the\n                  land and waited for life to form and nothing happened so we\n                  were just you know like worms in mud this is the image that\n                  came into my mind.b so that is billions of years ago.m yes yes in the second world i was shown in the\n                  second world that this very grotesque life form was produced\n                  and that they waited for it to evolve to see if it would be\n                  the right host for this spark of life  whatever you would\n                  like to call it i call it the spark of life  to be able\n                  to facilitate a spiritual life and a greater understanding\n                  of the universe but this in the second world the life that was formed\n                  was very very simple is the word that\n                  came to me very simple and basic and just really did not evolve so for myself when i look at that of course when\n                  i came back from this experience and it took me a while to\n                  even be able to put all of this associate it to the world i clearly was able to see that this was the dinosaur age then in the third world i was shown from above the earth\n                  and then again into this room where these people were that\n                  were taken from the third world and brought into this world and when i was shown from above what i saw was this city that\n                  was very very much filled with light so there were cities\n                  but they were not all over the earth they were just sort\n                  of in pockets here and there and so when i myself as miriam look back through history\n                  at this i see it as being some of those \u201clost worlds that\n                  have been looked for and some of them part of them found\n                  over the course of our lifetimes or over the last hundred\n                  years.so these three worlds that were talked about prior to this\n                  one it makes very clear sense to me in my limited knowledge\n                  of anthropology and paleontology and all of the rest of it it just looks clear to me that these were the different worlds.b okay my next question then that comes from that\n                  is that it sounds from what you are saying that you are\n                  talking time scale of the responsibility of the caretakers i think you call them that word other contactees of course\n                  have called them different terms some people call them \u201cthe\n                  watchers jim sparks called them \u201cthe keepers these\n                  are all approximations presumably transposed into our language for some kind of guardian race maybe that is another\n                  term we could use but the time scale they are talking about seems to be\n                  huge we are talking about certainly hundreds of millions\n                  of years and possibly billions how advanced are these people where are they from who are they or are not they extraterrestrials are they time travelers are they us in some way as some people\n                  in my view compellingly claim do you know what the score is\n                  here and what is the relationship between them and the\n                  other extraterrestrial races that you must have heard about?m yes first of all i had like to address the different\n                  names the keepers the watchers the caretakers i call them\n                  all of these things myself and the reason that i do is in\n                  part because they are all of these things they do\n                  watch over us they do take care of us they are our caretakers and they keep the knowledge in my book i write they are the\n                  keepers of the knowledge that the indigenous people are they\n                  too are the keepers of the knowledge and so forth so all\n                  of these terms these different terms that we use to describe\n                  them are correct in my view.the other question was what kind of a scale are we looking\n                  at as far as time is concerned now it is my understanding\n                  again from what they have shared with me onboard that\n                  craft that they have been here since the beginning of the\n                  earth and that they had a hand in creating humanity that\n                  they too as it was described to me by them that they too\n                  seek to know \u201cgod meaning the creator of all\n                  that is all that was and all that will be the creator of\n                  everything the very beginning the source of all things so they were given a task it is like saying you know whatever your job is when you get up in the morning and you\n                  go to work that is what your job is that is what\n                  you know that you do well when we are here on earth it is\n                  no different for them than to say that this is what they do they are the caretakers of the earth and this is what they have\n                  always done.as far as what timeline they are from it was also described\n                  to me that some of them are from our past our present and\n                  our future because the way that time was described to me they did have the ability to go back and forth and in the present they did have that ability how you had have to ask them\n                  that because i have no idea but they also said that some of them were physical that they\n                  were no different than you or i that they lived on the earth that they did live under the earth inside the\n                  earth that there were others that were inter-dimensional beings and there were others on different planets that all of them\n                  were created for the same task in these different areas and\n                  they all had the ability to communicate with one another and\n                  it was like saying that they were cousins.so it is a very complicated question to answer because\n                  it is so complicated to explain it is almost beyond my\n                  words to be able to clarify it.b our contact henry deacon who has encountered these\n                  situations from a completely different standpoint working\n                  under contract for the american military and the american intelligence\n                  services has said that it would take a book of at least a\n                  thousand pages and he just did not have the energy to write\n                  that or maybe he said ten thousand maybe he is\n                  not counting and the impression i got is that this whole back-story is\n                  so complex so deep so convoluted almost beyond human understanding such a backdrop of complexity that it is like who are\n                  we to try and figure this out we have actually got our\n                  own problems anything else is just intellectual curiosity but the fact is that they are there at least some of\n                  them are caring about us it would seem the question i do have though linked with what i was just\n                  mentioning about the american military and the american intelligence\n                  services do you know anything about the possible relationships\n                  of this group with the military or is it a different group\n                  of aliens that they have been working with do you know anything\n                  about that or is that a question you are unable to answer?m the question is will i answer i have not\n                  been told anything directly by these beings as to any relationship\n                  that was formed with any government or any group on the earth so let me make that clear i have not been given any direct\n                  information regarding that they have not said yes\n                  we work with these people we are working over here with\n                  that person however i have been shown and told certain things that were\n                  of a darker side and warned of certain things for example at one point i was shown something it is difficult difficult for me to talk about i was shown an image of being\n                  in an underground base that what took place there was\n                  so dark and ugly and horrifying to me that it was difficult\n                  for me to deal with.i do not know how to say this nicely but it was of i\n                  saw images of beings and of creatures that were just beyond\n                  the human comprehension of being able to see in real life now what happened in this time that i was shown this i was in the astral and the being the tall blond that i was\n                  with said you must be very quiet because if you are\n                  not they will know that we are here and do not ever\n                  come to this particular area it is very dangerous for you and\n                  i said okey doke i am not going anywhere near there so do these tall blonds have associations with certain groups\n                  on the planet no not that i am aware of.you asked me about these other beings that so many people\n                  are familiar with which one of the biggest ones is\n                  the grays i do not have any direct information but here\u2019s\n                  what i was told by the tall blonds that they are here as the\n                  caretakers of the earth and that they would help protect us\n                  from ourselves or other things that we may not be aware of so does that mean other beings absolutely does it mean that\n                  there is a presence of other beings on the planet absolutely am i here to talk about those beings with you no because\n                  i want the message of the tall blonds to be really clear with\n                  people that they are here in peace and that they do not mean\n                  us any harm.they will not come here and take over the earth that is not their purpose if it was their purpose they would\n                  have done it long long ago and they do not have a dark agenda\n                  in this genetic program that they have going and i want to\n                  talk about that because it is something that is very\n                  important to the people of earth in the third world these individuals that were created were\n                  created for the purpose of spiritual development and when\n                  the spiritual development was taking place all of this knowledge\n                  about spirit and life was a part of who we are where we are\n                  from and where we are going but again to reiterate\n                  what i have already said it was like giving children matches they just did not deal with it very well so what has\n                  happened since the beginning of our existence as humanity is\n                  that different families all over the earth have been given\n                  this certain genetic information in our genome right and along the way certain families are \u201cmonitored by\n                  these caretakers not to do anything dark but to help so that so very slowly these vessels that we are living in that we\n                  are a part of have the ability to withstand this greater information\n                  and knowledge because of course our brain is nothing more\n                  than a computer that is based on an electrical charge within\n                  the body so if we are over-loaded with electrical charges we will not be able to control the pathways in which this information\n                  is flowing and we become crazy.so these families have very slowly had their dna new strands\n                  of dna to help facilitate greater understanding greater knowledge greater respect for ourselves and the earth and that is\n                  what is happened with these families that are being monitored so that is also why sometimes people have had these things\n                  running in their families because they are one of these\n                  families that have been monitored and that is why the\n                  path leading back to where we all came from would be very interesting to be able to look at the family tree of some of these families\n                  through time.k is not this the this is actually the\n                  grays are in a sense working for at least one faction are\n                  working for the tall blonds or however you want to call them because you are talking about also in your \u201888 experience you have the four-foot-tall beings those were i assume the\n                  grays showing you onto the ship at which time you were meeting\n                  with the tall blonds so what happens is the grays are actually\n                  handling the genetic sort of manipulation under the direction\n                  of perhaps these higher beings.m only to a certain degree and there needs to be some\n                  clarification there  and this is one of the things that i myself have been very frustrated with in regard to the whole\n                  phenomenon  is the terms that we use in order to describe\n                  what it is that we are talking about for example when\n                  i myself say the word gray the first thing that pops\n                  into my mind is a being that has wrinkled skin has just the\n                  whole energy of fear for me personally they have their\n                  heads are larger but they are not huge their eyes are\n                  slightly slanted that sort of thing.when i am talking about the grays that i am talking\n                  about if you wanted to call them that these are four feet\n                  high with round black eyes and almost look like robots there is\n                  no features to them whatsoever they are very androgynous these other grays with the wrinkled skin and their little tiny\n                  noses those are a completely different breed so there needs\n                  to be clarification in that here\u2019s what i tell people also there is something that\n                  needs to be said about the understanding of people out there\n                  when someone such as myself comes forward when we talk to\n                  you about our experiences we talk to you about them not only\n                  from what it is that we have experienced but also from\n                  our perceptions understanding and how much we were taught\n                  by them so this is very important because if five people witness\n                  a car accident all five people are going to tell a slightly\n                  different story so the question is is the person telling\n                  the story a story-maker are they somebody that you know embellishes you have to take that into account is the person\n                  a very fastidious story-teller where they are telling\n                  every detail you know you have to take a look at the individual\n                  also to be able to know how to take that story so when it comes to these beings i have also been told\n                  by certain individuals that these \u201cgrays have\n                  been seen with the tall blonds and that their agenda is very\n                  dark but here\u2019s what i say and again this really\n                  needs to be having some clarification out there regarding this\n                  phenomenon i pray that if there are these beings i\n                  would ask these people watching to ask themselves this i pray that if there are caretakers that are looking over\n                  us and watching over us and if they are somehow related to\n                  god in any way shape or form that they not judge me on the\n                  evil people of this earth  because we all look the same our general descriptions are the same so because i am white i pray that i am not judged by the evil of other white people so when you come across one of these beings whether it is\n                  in your dreams which they can come to you in or whether it\n                  is in the astral which means your light body is leaving you or whether it is physical ask yourself this right from here do i have fear or\n                  am i simply just afraid do i have fear or terror because\n                  if you have terror you need to understand that and you need\n                  to say no i am not going to do this i am not going to\n                  participate i do not and will not be a part of this k right they need to protect themselves and they\n                  have this power.m yes.k and they need to know they have this power m yes.k and that is a very important message.m yes it is very important people forget that they\n                  think oh i do not have any control i do not\n                  have any power you do have a certain amount\n                  of power regarding this phenomenon when you are having\n                  contact and so it is really important to protect yourself\n                  in that way mentally and that is why again these tall blonds make it very\n                  clear that we need to educate ourselves not only in what is\n                  happening around us in the world but also on a more spiritual\n                  level because the more spiritually aware you become the stronger\n                  you become the more informed as to how it is that you can\n                  move forward spiritually and in the astral and in the dreams to be able to protect yourself from some of these other beings.all of them all of the beings that are out there whether\n                  it be grays or tall blonds each one that i meet individually i make them look at me in my eyes i make them look so that if\n                  they are looking at me and they are looking all over\n                  the place like this i say no no no i remember one dream in particular the two blonds came to\n                  me and they were trying to give me this very very strong message and i said to them you need to look at me and they said there is no time there is no\n                  time and i said no you either stop and look at me so that\n                  i can look in your eyes or i am not speaking to you so i looked in their eyes and i recognized them as being peaceful\n                  and from the right heart because you cannot look at someone at the rest of their body when we want to know who someone\n                  is even in this world we stop and we look at their eyes can\n                  i look at their eyes and be comfortable we have instant recognition as to whether or not we care for\n                  someone or not so use that in this phenomenon as well and\n                  if you do not want this happening tell them and just keep\n                  telling them that you do not and are not a willing participant and you demand that they stop you need to verbalize that will it stop i do not know it depends on your spirit it depends on how strong you are.k okay thank you very much for that that is\n                  very important and i am glad we can put that out there.m what i would like to share with everyone is that\n                  people like myself all over the earth are being stirred to\n                  movement and that stirring and that movement i believe is\n                  very relevant for every single human being on the earth i\n                  believe that because we are being awakened to begin\n                  sharing this information with people that there are great\n                  changes that are coming and that we need to all understand\n                  that what is this great knowledge the knowledge is that we are\n                  not alone that we are being watched that what we are\n                  doing is being looked upon by other beings that do have a certain\n                  amount of knowledge that we ourselves do not have and that\n                  we need to take responsibility for ourselves  only as the\n                  individual you are not responsible for the earth you are responsible\n                  for yourself accept that because we are all being awakened we are all making the connections with one another where this\n                  will all lead i believe that all of us are waiting to see because nothing is for sure we are writing this plan\n                  as we are going through it.one of the greatest concerns that i have in the views the visions that i was shown the information that was shared\n                  to me onboard that craft they talked to me a lot when i was\n                  with them about seeds and i am always trying\n                  to share this information with people one of the things that\n                  could save this earth is seeds because if every individual\n                  on the planet planted a small garden we would not have to\n                  produce as much oil or transportation or pollution or plastics\n                  to you know everything.it would also give every individual on the planet a taste\n                  again a glimpse of why we are here to be able to experience\n                  the beauty around us now i am going to ask everyone to take away from this\n                  whole interview today if they educate themselves on\n                  any one thing i am going to ask them to educate themselves\n                  on what is happening to the earth\u2019s seeds because it\n                  is of great concern to these tall blonds and always has been and even for myself what i have learned in the last few years\n                  regarding seeds and what is happening on the earth it\n                  is the greatest concern that every individual should\n                  have.if you accept that we are not alone that is great but educate yourself on seeds because it will change your view\n                  of the world and it will change the course of this earth for\n                  the better.k wonderful okay that is a very different take\n                  than you generally hear and i think there is a lot of\n                  wisdom there in that approach you do not even need free\n                  energy if you just plant a garden right?m right.k yeah it is a great idea.m i wanted to share something else you asked me a\n                  question you asked me a question regarding something that\n                  was given to me and i know that anyone watching this is going\n                  to be going back to that k right.m because it is very important when i\n                  was onboard the craft in 1988 i had memories come back to\n                  me from childhood that were very interesting because it was\n                  of a time when i was a very young child about four or five\n                  years old when i was taken onboard a craft and this memory\n                  came back to me very very clearly i really get into the details\n                  of this in the book because it is a key point to this phenomenon\n                  for myself now to take this story and put it into a few sentences i\n                  was taken on board a craft when i was four years old and during\n                  that time these beings gave me something and they told me\n                  to bury it and they said that one day i would know what it\n                  was for and that i would go back and find it.i get asked this all the time because i have written about\n                  it in great detail throughout the course of my life this thing\n                  keeps coming up over and over and over again i have not found\n                  it yet i know the area that it is in but i have not found\n                  it yet the question again is is it my imagination absolutely not because i have had far too many confirmations of this information\n                  given to me over the years one in particular coming back to\n                  me thirty-five years after the fact  or sorry thirty-six\n                  years after the fact  and a very clear clear indication\n                  that these memories that came back were absolutely crystal\n                  clear so is it there i believe it is have i found it no i have not will i let you know if i have i think the world will know\n                  if i have.the path that i have been on for the last few years of\n                  my life since 2003 has in a very round-about way been my\n                  driving force and this object is constantly in my mind and\n                  what i have noticed is since 2003 to the present day the images of it have become clearer and clearer and clearer so does that mean it is coming back to me does that mean\n                  it is physically coming back to me i believe it is so i think we are all including myself because i live\n                  this life because it is so profound every day even for me and because of the things that i have experienced in the\n                  past i am no different than anyone else out there i am\n                  waiting to see what happens next.k well thank you very much miriam i call you miriam\n                  blue star and there is a significance to the blue star\n                  that you have not mentioned would you like to talk about\n                  that briefly?m yes the blue star is the prophecy of the hopi people and again i do not speak on behalf of hopi however when i\n                  was on the craft in 1988 they told me that one day a star\n                  would appear in the sky for all of man to see nothing or no\n                  one would hide its presence from the world and it would be\n                  a sign to the people that the end is near and that it is time\n                  to prepare in 2003 when i went through hopi and i went back home i\n                  then went online and i started looking up the hopi trying\n                  to gather information about them and it was then that i found\n                  the hopi prophecy which is identical as well as the creation\n                  myth to the information that was given to me regarding the\n                  hopi people so the blue star is a prophecy of the hopi people and i was\n                  told that the star would appear exactly the same as the hopi so what i would ask is that you do your own research regarding\n                  these people and all the indigenous people around the world it will give you great insight and spiritual understanding.k but there was a blue star in the sky not so long\n                  ago we were driving through new mexico at the time and people\n                  were commenting on it you do not actually know if that\n                  was the blue star is that right?m because the blue star is a prophecy of the hopi people i cannot say for sure whether or not that was the blue star but that was a comet that blew up it was it is\n                  called 17p/holmes if you wanted to look it up it will give\n                  you more information and this was a comet that astounded researchers\n                  and astronomers because of what happened as a result of it it blew up and it was showing blue in the sky all over the\n                  earth it was very very clear at that time yes click\n                  here for the\n                  video interview  \u00a0\n\n\nintro paul\nlaviolette (plv this is the problem with black projects they are\ncompletely isolated from the rest of the world discovering things as\nif they found them themselves for the first time while everyone else\nwho may have been doing a lot of work on the subject is left out of\nthe loop that really people should be brought in from outside to\nhelp on this why\nkeep it secret we all want to help out to prepare for the next\nevent personally my standpoint is from all the work i have done i can only talk\nabout probabilities that we are overdue for one but i do not\nknow when it is going to come i can say that within the next\n400 years there is over 90 percent chance we are going to\nhave one whether it is a small one or a large one i do not\nknow so that is the best i can do now i would be saying something entirely different if i had real evidence\nthat there was one that somebody had actually detected one and\nthis would have also what we call an emp \u2013 electromagnetic\npulse \u2013 associated with it similar to what a high-altitude\nnuclear explosion would do in the atmosphere kerry\ncassidy (kc so are you that rare thing a scientist with a\nconscience p\n i guess you had say so yeah it is just me i guess my\ninterest is in helping humanity i am interested in the truth\nand not living in some dream of some belief system that other people\nare telling you and it does not fit the data start of interview bill\nryan (br this is bill ryan and kerry cassidy from project camelot\nand this is wednesday the 29th of july 2009 and we are in\nlagonissi which is just south of athens in greece it is our great\npleasure to be here because we are here with dr paul laviolette who\nis best described i believe as a maverick astrophysicist who has\nsome very important theories that may possibly be of some impact if\ni dare use that word to people on this planet at this time we are\nhere to ask paul to explain the \u201chypothesis of the galactic\nsuperwave and that is the smallest nutshell i can put\nthis into so paul why do not you introduce yourself and say something\nabout your background p\n well i grew up in a family of scientists in schenectady new york both my parents had worked on the \u201cmanhattan project my father was a nuclear engineer working on nuclear submarines at the\ntime so i was exposed at an early age to nuclear reactors and\nnuclear physics i\nwas sort of a science buff from very early with hobbies in\nchemistry electronics pyrotechnics i was the fellow on\nthe street who was launching rockets from his back yard \u2013\nalmost had a pretty bad accident it was sort of just a stroke of\nluck that i did not get hurt badly we\nmoved to greece for a couple years and that was quite an experience\nwhen i was in high school i went to johns hopkins for my ba in\nphysics i then did an mba i\nwas a conscientious objector so in the middle of my business degree i took off two years to do alternative service i was working at\nharvard doing research on public health on respiratory protection of\nworkers then\nafter finishing at the university of chicago \u2013 my mba \u2013 i\ndid my ph.d in system science at portland state university that\ntook quite a few years to go through that then\ni founded the starburst\nfoundation upon\ngraduating and that is still going it is a research\ninstitute what is it researching p\n well i founded it with the purpose of investigating further the\n\u201csuperwave phenomenon and in the event\nthat signs of a superwave were about to be arriving that we would go\ninto high gear alerting like when you have the first warning signs\nof an earthquake that you start alerting everyone we\nwere dealing here with a phenomenon that few people knew about so i\nfelt obligated to try and do my best to inform people about this new\nconcept so did you train and hire people that were able to handle and\nunderstand the science behind the superwave p\n at one time we had some volunteers\nhelp out for\nexample when we were getting ice core samples from holland to help\nprepare the chest to bring the ice but we never really had serious\nfunding to be able to hire people okay p\n most of the charitable institutions were interested in funding the\narts and they figured science is left to the national science\nfoundation\nin nasa but they\n tend to fund very conventional-type research that\nfits exactly with the paradigm so what you are saying basically is that you created this\ninstitute did you call it or would you call it a think tank or p\n i would call it a research institute institute okay and in theory it is there in case you find\nthat the superwave really is on the way but in a sense have not\nyou found that that is true already p\n well yeah there is a superwave on the way from the center of the\ngalaxy \u2013 it is 23,000 light-years traveled distance i\nbelieve there is not one but several on their way towards us there\nwere other purposes for the foundation also it was to do further\nwork on a physics that i developed called subquantum kinetics which\nhas new implications both for technology and for cosmology in fact\nit completely revises the way we regard the world the universe also\ni have done some work in the psychology area of thought formation\nand so that was a third possible area we could investigate but also\nalternative energy was a fourth topic so all of these okay so you are saying that there is a galactic superwave on\nthe way and you think there is more than one p\n yes several several p\n mm-hm okay and the reason you think there is more than one is p\n well you look at the past to understand the future in this case\nyou are dealing with a cyclic phenomenon we have the ice core\nrecord from both antarctica and greenland and people have measured\nberyllium-10 which is an indicator\nof cosmic ray intensity on the surface of the earth so it sort of\ngives you a chart of how cosmic ray intensity has varied over the\nlast few hundred-thousand years and going back you see these peaks i\nhad predicted you would find peaks when i did my ph.d dissertation\non this topic at portland state university and later the data came\nout and indeed there were peaks you\ncan take this and\nanalyze it to look\nat for the\nperiods you find that there are certain periods that come out of\nthis data one of them is around 26,000 to 28,000 years which is\napproximating the precessional cycle of the earth in fact the two\ntend to match up in a certain way which is very interesting another\nis around 11,500 years and the third one is around 5,700 years which is close to the mayan calendar cycle and you see that there\nwas a major event at the end of the ice age between 11,000 and 16,000\nyears ago and that we are in fact overdue now for another one there\nwere smaller events you see a small event around 5,300 years ago it\nlasted maybe 20 years or so there is also very small events \u2013\naveraging every 500 years or so \u2013 since then there were 14\nsmall puffs of gas that were emitted from the galactic center which\nindicates \nit was active but it\nwas not active enough to create a peak that you could see in the\n record so you determined this by looking at the ice cores and the amount of\ndebris in them am i wrong p\n well they were analyzing\nberyllium-10 which is\na radioactive element it is produced in the atmosphere by\ncosmic rays it does not originate on earth because being\nradioactive it eventually dissipates decays away it has a\nhalf-life longer than carbon-14 so they can go back further than\nwith carbon-14 with this okay so when you say there is a small\nevent what is a small\nevent comprised of how does that affect the earth p\n the small event that happened 5,300 years ago it was just a little\nspike and it was easily missed it was only seen because this\nparticular researcher did a very detailed study of the  core and\nthey found it \u2013 without remarking what it was i was the one\nthat called attention to it at\nthe same time another researcher found that the climate cooled\ninexplicably at that time and became dry in fact in the andes they\nfound lonnie\nthompson a\nglaciologist who i worked with at the time i was doing my ph.d research he was the one who sent me samples from the camp\ncentury ice core that\ni had analyzed his\nteam found actual vegetation frozen in the ice sort of like\nflash-frozen it still had a green color you know as if there were\nsome hail storm at that time it is the same year they found the\nice man the ice man in the alps dates to about the same time so it\nseems like there were sudden blizzards that occurred about that time so are you extrapolating that this superwave could cause an ice age p\n in this case it did not the small event did not cause an\nice age but it did cause cooling but in a larger event we see\nthese events occurring at the time of the initiation of the last ice\nage you see them lining up not only with the beginning of the ice\nage but also at the ending and with major climatic transitions in\nbetween so there is a definite connection between climate and\nthe superwaves okay i want to ask some questions here on behalf of a lot of intelligent\nlisteners we have who are alert to your name and to the fact that you\nhave been saying some things that are considered by many intelligent\npeople to be important but they still do not know what a\nsuperwave is i wondered if you can back right up and tell our\nviewers what is a\nsuperwave and do they exist or is it just a hypothesized event and why should\nthey care p\n a superwave consists of cosmic ray electrons gamma-rays x-rays light radiowaves \u2013 across the whole spectrum \u2013 along\nwith a gravity wave and this is all traveling at the speed of light\ntowards our solar system in fact it propagates throughout the whole\ngalaxy sort of like a spherical shell traveling out from the center\nof the galaxy so in simplistic terms it is an enormous cosmic-scale galactic explosion coming from the center of the galaxy p\n right we have all heard of gamma-ray\nbursts yes p\n in fact some scientists have theorized that the gamma-rays are\naccompanied by charged particles coming along with them that it is\nactually the charged particles that generate the gamma-rays on the\nway this is what a superwave is except on a much larger scale instead of a burst just of a fraction of a second we are\ndealing with something that could continue for hundreds even\nthousands of years when you say it could continue for hundreds\nor thousands of\nyears are you talking about it could travel for hundreds\nor thousands of\nyears and take that long to get here or are you talking about its\nactual impact on earth lasting for hundreds or thousands of years p\n the actual period that the earth would be going through this storm \u2013\nyou can think of it as a galactic storm \u2013 could be anywhere\nfrom a few hundred years to thousands of years like 4,000 years maybe 5,000 years so are you seeing traces that in the past \u2013 because you said\nevery 26,000 years that there is evidence of this and it matches\nwith the precession of the equinox are you saying that during that\ntime there is evidence that it stayed around its impact lasted\nfor up to 4,000 years or at those times did it last for shorter\nperiods p\n if you look at the record \u2013 in my book i showed the\nberyllium-10 record \u2013-\nyou see for example around 40,000 years ago there was quite a hefty\npeak there lasting 5,000 years the whole thing this\nis actually one event that there is been a lot of study on by\nother glaciologists they all agree that the cosmic ray intensity\nwent up in a real fashion at that time although they propose an\nalternative theory of supernova explosion without saying where is\nthe supernova they suggested a star nearby exploded my\nanswer to that is this happens very rarely to have a star explode\nthat close to cause the cosmic ray intensity to significantly\nincrease on earth and we are talking about many peaks you\nknow they just wanted to explain the one but what about in the\nrecord that we have there is something like twelve to fifteen\npeaks and these are cyclical so in essence stars do not explode on\na cyclical basis as far as we know p\n that is the other thing yeah okay i want to ask you paul is there a recognized hypothesized\nmechanism whereby whatever it is at the center of the galaxy \u2013\nand\nthere are those\nwho\nthink it is a\nblack hole \u2013 would actually emit these superwaves on a cyclical\nbasis is there some theoretical background for the existence of that\nperiodicity p\n i have not heard them put forward something\nto explain the\ncyclic nature i think that they find it sort of mysterious the\nconventional view because they see this going on in other\ngalaxies they are called exploding\ngalaxies or\nseyfert\ngalaxies quasars these are\nvarious names for the same sort of thing at\none time they thought a quasar was an\nunusual\nobject in space when\nin fact it turns out it is a galaxy whose center has become so\nbright that it looks star-like and they do not see the galaxy\nitself but with the space telescope they found the spiral arms\nthere they\nwould think that these exploding galaxies have a cycle on the order\nof several hundred-million years and that the period of the explosion\nwould last about a few million years with the idea that if it\nhappened in our own galaxy  because they also would say well it is possible it would happen in our galaxy too but they say well we are\nin a quiescent period now which should hold for at least another\n50-million years so we should not be worrying about it and\neven if it did\nhappen the\nconventional view is that these cosmic rays would be held back by the\nmagnetic fields that these would come to our rescue to hold back the\ncosmic rays from leaving the center of the galaxy so to get back to your theory though of what you call the\nsuperwave you see evidence that we are in the midst of a superwave\nnow or several of them you are saying p\n no they have not arrived we are in the eye of the\nhurricane the nice sunny period\nin between before\nthe storm arrives the thing is that you cannot see them coming\nbecause they travel at the speed of light so it is a phenomenon\nthat is totally without warning just like a gamma-ray burst they only know it when their detectors pick it up and then they are\nable to locate where it came from well if it is coming to our solar system would not other\nplanets be affected before we would p\n yes it affects all planets all stars so in a sense you could see it coming if you saw the effects on\nother planets before it hit earth is that right p\n well the light from those effects on the other planets also travels\nat the speed of light so it actually lags behind the actual event\nitself yeah i understand very well that this is something that you cannot\nsee happening because of the nature of the limited speed of light and this is something that travels\noutward at\nthe speed of light so basically this comes up and hits you from\nbehind as it were and you have got no warning p\n yeah there would be only one way i could see that you could have\nwarning if let us say a hypothesis that there were\ncivilizations in the galaxy there was intelligent life and they\nrecognized the importance of knowing when these were coming and set\nup outposts at different points that were able to relay a signal that\nwas superluminal \u2013 in other words that would travel\nfaster than the speed of light \u2013 to get the warning here so\nwe had know exactly when the next one was going to arrive that is\npossible yeah okay well we actually have a witness we call him jake simpson who\nhas said that they did\nsend a superluminal craft outside this solar system and that they\nhave\nseen a wave approaching he called it a\nwave we are not\nsure if he actually meant\na wave but in essence they saw something\nheaded toward us p\n who is they the people that he works for in black projects basically this is\njake simpson so that was one of the reasons that we were sort of\ninterested in hearing your theory because in many ways it\nseems to coincide\nwith what he was saying with what they\nsaw p\n and how close is it did he say in this period of years between now and 2017 p\n mm-hm yes it was very interesting it was a conversation which i\npersonally had with him last october when we met he is not a\nphysicist but he is an intelligent man he is worked for\nblack projects on the inside and he is saying things to us that\nare at the limit of what he can say what\nhe said was that there is a\nwave coming he stressed\nthat the wave was a sort of loose term it was a metaphor he said to\nthink of it in terms of a\nwave he said it like\nthat and i have no idea whether he is acquainted with your\ntheories p\n well this is the problem with black projects they are\ncompletely isolated from the rest of the world and discovering things\nas if they found them themselves for the first time while everyone\nelse who may have been doing a lot of work on the subject is left out\nof the loop the\nonly people that lose out are the human race basically because i have\nbeen here i have been working on superwaves since 1979 so about\n30 years and i would be happy to work with them i believe i had\nhave something to contribute if they did\nindeed have some\ninformation like that so actually is it possible that they are following your work benefiting from it p\n oh i am sure they have bought my book and it is\ncirculated among the black project scientists especially if your parents as you said worked in the manhattan\nproject p\n well regardless of that i think they are searching for new\nideas all the time to sort of funnel this into what they are\ndoing i think to some extent they realize that they do not have\nall the ideas that there is interesting stuff out there but\ni think it is that really people should be brought in from\noutside to help on this why keep it secret we all want to help out to prepare for the next event personally my standpoint is from all the work i have done i can only talk\nabout probabilities that we are overdue for one but i do not\nknow when it is going to come because i am looking at the\npast record i see the cycles i\nsee when the last events occurred and i can say that within the next\n400 years there is over 90 percent chance we are going to\nhave one whether it is a small one or a large one i do not\nknow so that is the best i can do now i would be saying something entirely different if i had real evidence\nthat there was one that somebody had actually detected one the\nstarburst foundation for example would go into high gear to say you know we have got\nto start preparing we are\nnot prepared for something like this not even for a carrington\nevent\nsolar flare which\ncould wipe out all the power systems if we had one so are you saying that the superwave would result in the wiping out\nof the power systems p\n oh yeah what other effects would it have p\n the thing is the superwave on its forefront would have a very\ndense sort of shock-front of cosmic rays and this would have also\nwhat we call an emp \u2013 \nelectromagnetic\npulse \u2013 associated with it similar to what a high-altitude\nnuclear explosion would do in the atmosphere when\nthis arrives it is going to create similar phenomena just like\nthe starfish\nexplosion \u2013 i\nbelieve it was near hawaii \u2013 and when the emp wave arrived there were whole\nsections of the island that were having blackouts as a result it\nalso would fry electronic circuits phones would go out we have\nhad even smaller events like\ngamma-ray bursts affect the communication systems and do damage to our communication\nsystems so something like this would pretty much roast all the\nsatellite equipment we have got cell telephones would not\nbe working tv would be off the air if\nit depended on\nsatellite perhaps\ntelephones would continue to work if it was fiber-optic if it was\ninsulated from this sort of thing your power lines would pick up the\npulse the wires would have a huge voltage surge which would fry the\ntransformers \u2013 the step-down transformers that go from your\nmillion-volt voltages down to\nthe voltages you\nuse in your house would not it also affect the cars that we have now p\n the cars that are all now with chips in them in the case of an emp\nfrom a nuclear explosion for example they warn that it could fry\nthe chips in a car and this is something that could last for a hundred years you are\nsaying once it arrived p\n the forefront \u2013 we are talking about something that might\njust be minutes and it would be probably preceded by a gravity wave\nwhich would cause earthquakes seismic events all over the earth not\njust in one place so that might be the first warning actually things shaking let me back up just a fraction again to help our viewers understand\nthis mostly to help me understand this does a superwave incorporate\na gamma-ray burst or are these two different phenomena that you are\ndescribing p\n different the gamma-ray bursts\nthat they talk\nabout are usually from isolated stellar explosions perhaps very\npowerful supernova explosions they have some special physics\ninvolved there that the stars are very unusual like neutron stars\ncolliding and so on okay p\n the thing is that whatever they are we can only guess because\nthey are so far away most of the gamma-ray bursts that we are\npicking up come from other galaxies millions of light-years away there is\nbeen only one case we have observed one that came from within\nour galaxy it was a place near the galactic center but not at the\ncore what is unusual there is that about two days before the\ngamma-ray burst arrived was the worst seismic event that we have\nhad in 30 years that caused the 2004\nboxing\nday tsunami in\nmalaysia and over 250,000 people died in that event so you are saying that was caused by a gamma-ray explosion p\n gamma-ray burst this was the first one\nthey found that\nwas emitted from within our galaxy it was the most intense that\nthey had ever observed in the history of gamma-ray observatory\nphysics the\ncoincidence of being just shortly after the worst earthquake we have\nhad in 40 years you can do the probabilities and you come up with\nvery small probability\nthat it is\ndue to chance so you are saying this gamma-ray\nversus a superwave if\nyou were to compare them as events would you say that the superwave\nis it sounds like it is much more long-range it would impact\nfor years at a time p\n yeah and it is cyclical as opposed to the gamma-ray bursts that\nmaybe are not explainable p\n the gamma-ray burst probably the source star ends up blowing itself\nup completely into smithereens so there is no cycle involved whereas\ncore explosions we are dealing with the massive object at the\ncenter of the galaxy \u2013 scientists call it a black hole i do not\nbelieve in black holes and i know other astrophysicists that do not\nbelieve in black holes but i do believe it is a very massive\nobject i believe it is the core of a star in\nnatural evolution a star will eject its atmosphere and you are\nleft with a very dense core it has a density similar to a white\ndwarf star which is like they say one-ton-per-cubic-centimeter or\nin an extreme case go to the density of a neutron star which is a\nmillion times greater i\nmean we are talking about a spiral galaxy whose core object has\nevolved to the point where it is starting this outburst cycle and by the way that is how a galaxy is formed these outbursts\nactually participate in the formation of the galaxy that is\nwhat causes the spiral phenomenon because without these outbursts the spiral arms would wind up on themselves this is a problem which\nastrophysicists have wondered about why\ndo not the spiral arms wind up as it turns well it is because you have these periodic outbursts coming out\nand they sort of propel everything but do you know what causes that the periodic outbursts p\n yeah i have theory that comes out of subquantum kinetics in\nsubquantum kinetics you have a continuous creation of matter and\nenergy basically a violation of the first law of thermodynamics which is no big deal you know maybe physicists would consider it\na big deal but\nthe point is that we are talking about a level that is 10\norders of magnitude smaller than what they can observe in a\nlaboratory in fact i have suggested an experiment where they can\nobserve it in space with microwave signals between spacecraft i\npublished the amount of the energy increase of a photon over that\nperiod of distance in fact they ended up finding this and it is\ntoday called the pioneer\neffect okay so this subquantum kinetic \u2013 what do you call \u2013\nparticles it is a theory p\n subquantum kinetics\nis the name i gave to the physics it is resulting from taking\nconcepts in system theory the area i was studying for my ph.d work if\nyou bring systems concepts into physics and bring for example models that have been developed in the area of chemistry of how\nchemical waves form i realized that these for example form a very\ngood model for describing how a particle forms in space and you find\nthat it solves a lot of problems which physics had before physics\ntraditionally has been based on mechanics and we are talking\nabout a chemical reaction approach to physics actually you could say\nit is alchemical\nand it ties in with ancient ideas too does this relate to hyper-dimensional physics and particles being\nwaves depending on how you look at them p\n okay it does postulate the existence of higher dimensions the\nbasic idea which is what steered me into all of this work that i have\nbeen doing was the realization that the basis of existence is flux this is totally different from what physicists have been teaching physicists\nteach that the basis of existence is structure\n\u2013 there are particles that are somehow bound to each other even quarks they speak of quarks in gluons the \u201cglue that holds them together so to speak if\nthey begin talking about flux because from their\npoint of view physics is a positivist science they want to\nobserve to actually say well there it is i observe it where\nis this flux well they cannot see it you cannot see this\nflux because it is at an etheric\nlevel you postulate an ether as a substrate forming\nphysical phenomena a gamma-ray burst basically\nis a local event\nthat comes from a supernova which is\nhugely destructive and powerful\nand we are quite fortunate to not have any near us we basically\nmainly\nhave seen them if\ni understand it right in neighboring galaxies but\nthe superwave is something different which is cyclical is\naccompanied by a gravity wave is accompanied by cosmic ray debris\nand lasts quite a long time like a storm and leaves its imprints\nand its echoes materially in ice core samples which is the tangible\nevidence that you have that there is something going on here\nthat is not being recognized can\nyou speak to all of that and lay this out simply for people so that\nthey can sort of see the territory\nthat we are\ntalking about here p\n okay we also have supernova explosions in our own galaxy but\nthey are not of the kind of the very powerful ones that cause\nthese gamma-ray\nbursts unless when we are seeing these gamma-ray bursts what it is is just a\nclump of very energetic particles that happened to come our way at\nthat moment when scientists are saying it\nwas very very powerful they are saying imagine\nthat this was the same energy from whatever angle you viewed this\nstar and it would end up\ntotaling to a huge astronomical amount of energy but\nif it was just a clump a collimated\nburst that happened to\ncome then you are down to more reasonable levels the thing is\nwe do not really know these things are so far away but we do\nknow that supernova explosions that have happened within our galaxy\ndo not really affect us that much unless it happens to be one\nvery close like within 30 light-years which is a very rare event but\nthe core explosions are different in that instead of just a fraction\nof a second for the event you are talking about anything from\nseveral years for a very minor event to 4,000 to 5,000 years duration the\nlonger events can actually start affecting climate because what they\ndo is they vaporize cometary ice which is surrounding our solar\nsystem end up pushing this nebular material into the solar system and it affects the way light gets to the earth from the sun it ends\nup energizing the sun it falls onto the sun the sun becomes more\nactive and more of a flaring star actually\nthe sun ends up then doing more damage to earth than the superwave\nitself the superwave is sort of what gets this dust in and then you\nget worse things happening so is it possible that solar cycle 24 could be acting on the earth\nas a result of a superwave that is going to hit the sun p\n no no p\n no because we have in the in-between period in between\nsuperwaves the solar system is fairly clean of dust i\nmean if the solar system was packed with dust like the level i am\ntalking about we would all see it you would see the moon being\nblotted out by a dust cloud or a huge dust cloud going across the\nsun oh wow p\n it would be definitely coast to coast news both sides of the\nplanet these dust clouds are not they also traveling at the speed of\nlight from the galactic core p\n no no the dust does not come from the core of the galaxy it is already around our solar system and it is pretty much\nstationary relatively stationary just orbiting the sun normally but\nwhen the superwave arrives it creates a sort of a shock-front around\nthe solar system because the solar system has magnetic fields around\nit and it creates what they call bow-shock\naround\nthe heliopause heliopause\nis the name of the sort of protective sheath of magnetic fields\naround the solar system in\nthe magnetic fields the superwave particles tend to get trapped to\nsome extent and build up to very high levels enough of a\ndensity of cosmic ray energy to actually start vaporizing ice when\nthat happens it is actually able to raise the temperature from\nclose to let us say ten degrees above absolute zero up to the\nlevel where the ice could vaporize and release both dust and water\nvapor \u2013 gas \u2013 into space and this stuff gets pushed in as\nit is being pushed in by the superwave cosmic rays it is\nlike a battle between the solar wind and the superwave cosmic rays the solar wind is sort of expelling this dust but then the superwave\nis pushing this in and it will actually compress the magnetic field\nsheath that is around the solar system inward in\nmy thesis which i published in 1983 on\ngalactic core explosions and their effect on the earth and solar\nsystem www.etheric.com/laviolettebooks/euf-cd.html]\ni was suggesting that\nat the end of the ice age the sheath actually got pushed in almost\nto mars orbit so from there it is just a short hop for\nthis dust then to come in around the sun it\nwould actually produce a cocoon around the sun so that the sun\nwould not be yellow like we see it it would be reddish so let me feed back to you what i think that you are saying what you are saying is that the\nsuperwave creates\na huge energetic impact on the dynamic systems in the solar system\nand then that causes so many energetic complications \u2013 and i am\nspeaking very generally here deliberately \u2013 and that is\nactually what creates the major changes in the weather that could\nlast several thousand years because\nthe reverberations electromagnetically and the dust clouds and the behavior\nof the sun and everything else are going to cause quite a long ripple\neffect locally after the superwave itself is actually all over have\ni got that approximately correct p\n yeah think of this in systems concepts think of a system and they\nspeak of perturbing the\nsystem with an outside\ninfluence of force or something yeah p\n the solar system and in fact the earth\u2019s climatic system is\nhere being perturbed by conditions that normally do not exist\ntoday the whole energetics around the earth changes if\nit is in place for decades and decades that is long enough\nfor the earth\u2019s climatic system to get perturbed into let us\nsay an ice age or to come out of an ice age if it was very brief it would not be long enough to cause this huge climatic shift\nthat we have seen but you are saying that you have observed that this is cyclical\nand you have observed that this happens every 26,000 years and\nfrom what i understand in your book you are pulling in\nastrology the tarot the mayan calendar and all these sort of\nprophecies that you know how the hopi say there are different ages\nthat we go through in a sense you must be predicting one coming\nfairly soon p\n right according to the cycle p\n yeah well i found cycles of 26,000 11,500 and 5,700 years this\nwas a study done by some people in the state of washington who did\nsome number crunching as a sort of contribution to starburst \u2013\nwe do have people that help out at times with that we could see that\nwe are overdue presently but\nbefore they had done this to get more of a scientific accurate\nestimation of the cycles you could see my own work i did just by\neyeballing it and could see that there was this both 13,000- and\n26,000-year period there but i was a little off perhaps the short\none is more close to 11,500 and then there is a 5,700-year\nperiod so if it arrives faster than the speed of light then p\n not faster i am suggesting at\nthe speed of light although the gravity wave would have been slightly\nsuperluminal at the very beginning if it was due to an explosive\noutburst that would have caused it to get a slight head start but\npretty much the whole thing travels at the speed of light towards us so then it could happen at any time i mean am i right p\n yeah we are in the danger period you have to realize \u2013\nwhich a lot of scientists do not because their theories still\nbelieve that galactic core explosions are every hundred-million years\n\u2013 you have to realize that we are on the fringe of a volcano a\ngalactic volcano and it is an active volcano and we should be\nexpecting the eruption very shortly when you say very\nshortly because i\nunderstand you are looking very long range \u2013 what is\nvery shortly is that in a year two years four years a hundred years p\n i do not know i only go out on the limb and i say there is\na 90 percent chance in the next 400 years of this happening all right p\n i think i am pretty safe that something will happen even if\nit is a small outburst because modern\nastronomy has been around only for a few hundred years now we\nhave not seen any bright luminosities coming from the galactic\ncenter what about the fact that we are coming equal with the galactic\ncenter does that affect any of this or make it more likely or will\nthe way it hits us change p\n no what you are talking about the mayan calendar and the sun\ncrossing the galactic plane there is no effect there it is\nmore you have to look at the period and when the last event happened it is\ninteresting that the 5,300-year event the small event of 20-year\nduration or so occurred just before the beginning of the mayan\ncalendar cycle the one that we are currently in that cycle\nbegan 5,126 years before 2000 or before 2012 so around 3100 bc whereas\nwe are seeing this event was around 3300 bc plus or minus a few\nhundred years because we do not know accurately from the\ndating we are relying on ice core dating and it could be a\nlittle off maybe it is off by a hundred years or so what i want to achieve here is some way of assisting many people who\nwatch our videos to understand the scientific basis for which it is\nplausible that something might be coming this way and it is in\nour interest to understand and possibly even to prepare for that\npeople are picking up intuitively they are reading things on\nthe internet things get distorted and muddied around and they do not\nknow what they are reading they\nhear these terms like superwave\nand gamma-ray\nburst and they do not\nknow what they mean and they do not know whether this is this\nmumbo-jumbo or whether it is really something that could affect\ntheir lives and change their lives and they do not know what\nbasis there is for taking these things seriously and digging more\ninto it the\nreason why we are here talking to you is because you are\nthe man who represents and is the spokesperson for these important\nideas and i say they are important ideas because any hypothesis\nin physics is an important idea even if it is disproved it was\nan important idea until it was disproved and this takes the whole\nthing forward as you will understand so\nthe opportunity here is for you to explain to the viewers as best as\nyou can how it is that these phenomena should be taken seriously in\nyour recommendation what impact they might have on us what are the\nprobabilities is\nthis catastrophism that we should be ignoring and say you\nknow what everything\u2019s going to be fine because it is\nalways been fine or\nmaybe the geological record shows that things have not always been\nfine and you should be on the alert because we are living on an\nunstable planet in a very dynamic system that is affected by\nall kinds of things\nwhich we are only just on the verge of starting to understand p\n well what you are saying is the same question that went\nthrough my mind is this a real phenomenon that is what caused\nme to change the topic of my dissertation my ph.d work to\ninvestigate the superwave phenomenon in\n1979 is when i first discovered that this might occur i formed a\nhypothesis i called it the galactic explosion hypothesis and\nconvinced my dissertation committee that i could do this i could test this\nhypothesis and that i could produce a ph.d on this which i\ncould not have done at a lot of universities it\nhappened that i was in a program that was very interdisciplinary so\nthe idea of bringing in evidence from various areas \u2013 from\ngeology astronomy paleontology high energy physics \u2013 was\nfitting with this program in\nthe end i summarized the evidence and found that it all seemed to\nsupport this concept that a superwave\nhad indeed passed\nthrough our solar system between eleven and sixteen thousand years\nago causing major effects to the climate we\nhad a very significant mass extinction called the pleistocene\nextinction where large mammals died along with species of birds and\na number of other animals some people have said\nit was the worst\nextinction to have occurred since the extinction of the dinosaurs i\nwas also drawing from ancient legends although i did not\ninclude that in the dissertation but i do believe that that is\na valuable source of information well the flood myths for example p\n flood myths the story of the sun burning the earth horus being\nstung by the scorpion \u2013 the scorpion is the sign in the\ndirection of the galactic center \u2013 things like this this is where the tail of the scorpion in the astrological symbol\nactually points toward the galactic center p\n right as if the ancients\nwere trying to\ntell us something p\n yeah there are two\narrows in the astrological symbols now remember that the signs what we call the astrological signs are actual constellations out\nthere and this is how they were originally formed as star\nconstellations there\nare two arrows in the zodiac one is the sagittarius arrow and the\nother is the tail of the scorpion and they are both pointing it\nseems at something this was my first connection i made between astrology and the\ngalactic core explosion phenomenon when i realized that the center of\nthe galaxy was in that region where they were pointing so what you are positing there was the ancient astrologers who\nwere also astronomers were actually trying to leave a message for us\nin such a way that it would not get lost over time p\n right i believe that the zodiac was a cryptogram a time capsule\nmessage that was created to warn the future civilization on our\nplanet about this so that is where your intellectual journey started but presumably you\ncould not say this in your ph.d thesis p\n right i did not include any of that i mean who cares really where you got your idea the point is you make an hypothesis\nand you are testing it \u2013 is there scientific evidence for\nit this is the main thing from the scientific standpoint\nthat you are concerned with so what you say is that there is no pole shift that you do not\nsee evidence of actual \u2013 and maybe you can explain this to me \u2013\nbut my understanding is you say that there were not pole shifts\nat those 26,000-year periods but there was instead this galactic\nsuperwave explosion or even 13,000 or 12,000-year cycles p\n right i believe that the climatic shifts that people have \u2013\nother i do not know if you want to call them scientists \u2013\nthat other theoreticians have suggested that a pole shift was\ninvolved in creating a climatic change first\nof all there are so many shifts of climate just even during the\nyounger\ndryas which was\nbetween 11,600 and 13,000 years ago you see something like 40 major\nshifts of climate within that cold period and to say that was to due\nto a shifting back and forth of the pole gets to be a little absurd okay what is your response to the serious work of charles\nhapgood and rand\nflem-ath\nand colin wilson who is\nbeen popularizing the idea i\nmean we tend to call it pole shifts but they are talking about\ncrustal displacement i understand that you do not feel that the\ncrustal displacement theory is valid and\ni would be very\ninterested to hear why that is in your view p\n you know if the evidence supported it i would be for it but you\njust go to the ice core evidence to test that theory for example mr flem-ath was talking about antarctica being sort of up closer to\nwhere chile is during the ice age and that it suddenly shifted down\nto its present position at the end of the ice age okay if that was true then you would expect the climate in antarctica\nshould have been warmer during the ice age and you do not see\nthat i sent him something like four\nclimate curves\nfrom antarctica which showed it was colder during the ice age from\ndifferent parts of antarctica it did not seem to sway him i\nguess but\nfor me looking at that data that rules out a shifting of the poles so any kind of crustal p\n plus it would have caused sloshing of the oceans you would expect if there\nwere such a thing then how come we do not find saltwater deposits inland we do\nfind flood deposits but it is due to fresh water which i have\nsuggested is due to melting of the ice sheets \u2013 a catastrophic\nmelting could catastrophic melting of the ice sheets explain the great\nflood p\n yes yes there was that much water p\n yes it is something that does not happen today because we\ndo not have ice sheets we do have ice caps like\nin iceland we have situations where the glacier there is melted in a\ncertain area by a volcano and creates sort of a reservoir of water\nwhich eventually bursts through a dam and pours down they call this\na glacier burst these are very small-scale compared to what was\nhappening during the ice age so in order for there to have been a great flood like the one\ndescribed in the myths the ice sheet would have had to have been\nmuch larger and sea level lower than it is at the moment and there\nwould have to be a catastrophic melting your theory is that that\ncould only have been produced by some huge cosmic-scale event which\nyou are calling a superwave is that right p\n it was mainly the sun involved the superwave triggered the\nconditions for the sun becoming more active okay p\n also the cosmic dust around the earth actually creates in some\ncases a warming effect because it can actually scatter light that\nnormally\ngoes out into\nspace back onto the earth and creates sort of an interplanetary\nhothouse effect okay p\n this was something not only going on on the earth but also we see\nevidence on mars of canyons that appear to have been cut by\ntremendous floods of water yes p\n i believe that mars is mostly covered by ice sheet it is sort\nof like a tundra the walls of the canyons are actually ice that\nwould have melted during some of these events especially\nthere are cases where the earth was being hit by super-sized coronal\nmass ejections we have evidence from the moon of glazed rocks and\none nasa scientist was suggesting that the moon was exposed to very\nintense radiation from the sun to do this something like 100-times\ngreater luminosity of the sun for at least 100 seconds in\nmy dissertation i suggested the alternative that perhaps both the\nearth and moon had gotten engulfed in a coronal mass ejection and\nthat this was hot enough to actually melt particles on the moon does your theory accommodate the loss of water on mars as a result\nof a superwave action upon the sun p\n can you say more about the loss of water on mars well my understanding is that mars used to have water and maybe\neven plentiful water and that at some point it disappeared and\nthere are different theories to explain that disappearance p\n mars is about two kilometers deep in ice right now you mean p\n it is covered with an ice sheet from pole to pole you might\nfind some areas where it is more rock but for the most part\nit is ice why\ndoes it look like dust like a dusty surface because on mars when\nthe sun shines on this icy surface the ice sublimates turns\ndirectly to gas and leaves the dust behind so for the first few\ncentimeters it is just dust but below that is what we would\ncall permafrost has this been validated by the rover the mars rover p\n yeah they had a rover thing going around just a year ago or two right p\n they had pictures they sent back and sure enough there were chunks\nof white which was really ice mixed in with the dirt the reason they\nknow that it was ice they took pictures a little while later when\nthe sun had a chance to shine on it and it had disappeared evaporated so this stuff is just below the surface in\nfact they see gullies which look like freshly-formed by running\nwater so in some cases this ice melts as long as it is\nunderground there is enough pressure to make it turn into water\nand it can actually gush out from the sides of some of these canyons\nand create these ravines that is pretty interesting p\n i was saying this about mars being covered with permafrost way back and as more and more data has come out with the satellites they have\nbeen doing radar sensing and they find it is several kilometers\nor so deep with water there it is not pure water  it is\nmixed with dust and stuff i was not aware of that p\n so going to mars there is no question that we will find\nwater i mean wherever you land all you have to do is get something\nto melt whatever you dig up okay let me take you back to the events of eleven twelve thousand\nyears ago whenever one of the events on the legitimate historical\nrecord according to plato is the sinking of atlantis round about\nthe same time as these mass extinctions of all the large mammals and\nso on and so forth is\nit possible that a superwave would be accompanied by the kind of\ngravity wave that i believe in your thinking it does not cause\na crustal displacement but i think your words are it jerks\nthe planet to such a\ndegree that it can cause serious impact resulting in earthquakes and\nother disasters p\n yes you do not need to really have a huge displacement of the\npole to cause major seismic disturbance on the planet what about a magnetic pole shift is this related at all i believe the magnetic pole shifts are due to the sun\u2019s effect\non the earth what happens there \u2013 i describe it in my thesis\nand articles \u2013 when a coronal mass ejection arrives the solar\ncosmic ray particles get trapped in the earth\u2019s magnetic field they produce what are called storm-time\nradiation belts around\nthe earth the\nparticles end up drifting the electrons in one direction the\nprotons in the other and this generates what they call a ring\ncurrent \u2013 this is\nall accepted geophysics \u2013 and produces a magnetic field opposed\nto the earth\u2019s field they\nobserved this after the 1956 solar proton event when a coronal mass\nejection a fairly large one had hit the earth they observed a one\npercent decrease of the magnetic field at that time so\nall you have to do is scale that up a hundred times and there were\nin fact events that were that large around the time of the extinction\nof the mammoths and ground sloths and you do see carbon-14 spurts this\nis something i am about to publish this is very new i have\nactually located in the ice core the event when that solar cosmic ray\nburst hit the planet that would have been enough particle energy to\nactually cancel out the earth\u2019s magnetic field so you are saying that the sinking of atlantis resulted from\nthat p\n no i have a totally different view of the atlantis story i believe\nit is an allegorical story i do not believe and i have\nargued with people who are atlantis enthusiasts they believe they are\ngoing to go out and find an island with moats and dikes around it now that is the part in critias the atlantis myth is broken into two parts one in plato\u2019s book\nof critias and one in\nplato\u2019s book of\ntimaeus the\ncritias myth is the creation of atlantis and the timaeus myth is\nabout the flood which if you date the time it is given in\nplato\u2019s myth it comes to about 11,600 years ago when in fact\nthere was a very accelerated period of glacial melting the sea level\nwas rising very rapidly at that time so you were having flooding i\nbelieve that in the timaeus myth atlantis is symbolizing the ice\nsheet the sinking signifies the ice sheet was melting as\nyou remember in the myth it was talking about atlantis leaving\nbehind a shoal of mud when ice melts and the floods subside that is\nwhat you have a shoal of mud so in effect atlantis the north\namerican ice sheet which is almost like a continent \u2013 they\nspeak of it as a continent \u2013 dissipated and is now in the\nwaters the ocean in\nfact in plato\u2019s book this is a discussion between solon the ruler of athens and a priest in egypt at sais egypt the priest tells him that these myths like the story of\natlantis or the conflagration myth about phaeton\nand the sun chariot where the sun ended up burning the earth that\nthese are allegorical stories these things did not really\nhappen the way the myths describe you\nhave to infer that this is a parable look at it allegorically for\nexample he referred to the story of phaeton that this really\nrepresents astronomical bodies in their effect on the earth in fact\nin this case the sun so what about that they say that the magnetic poles are\nshifting now do you agree with that p\n by how much are they saying well i am not sure bill can you explain i think they have\nactually said there is a noticeable shift recently yeah i do not have the numbers my understanding is that it is\nrecognized that there looks to be a gradual shift happening because\nof a weakness there seems to be a gradual shift happening i do not\nhave the numbers that may mean that it is hard for us to talk\nabout but i thought that that was recognized maybe i am wrong p\n well the intensity of the magnetic field has changed over time it is varied up and down by about 50 percent during this last\ninterglacial the last 11,000 years in fact it is been\nweakening since 2,000 years ago so\nthat is a trend which probably could be continuing i have not\nlooked at the same data you are talking about okay to get back to the galactic superwave and its impact on earth and when it could occur are you using predictive sort of\nreferencing certain things like the tarot like astrology like you\nknow the i ching etcetera to predict the coming of the superwave p\n no okay so what are you using p\n it is all based on science and something we did not get\nto is what is the evidence for the past\nevent i really did not get into that okay p\n i made a series of predictions and one was if \u2013 and this was\nthe key test that i performed but there were others \u2013 was that\nif this had actually occurred it would have pushed cosmic dust into\nthe solar system and we should therefore see higher levels at that\ntime so\ni did a study of ice core samples i was sent some by lonnie thompson\nand i also got some ice directly from the ice core laboratory and\nprocessed it myself i\nused neutron activation analysis which is a technique where you\nirradiate the dust that you filter out from the ice you irradiate it\nin a nuclear reactor and it becomes radioactive and you see what is\nin it i\nwas looking particularly for nickel and iridium which for example iridium is 10,000 times more abundant in cosmic\nmaterial than it is in the typical crustal material i in fact found peaks where the iridium level for example was hundreds of\ntimes higher than what we normally get today so it indicated\nsomething was really happening this\nwas a discovery that was as significant as the discovery of the\niridium peak at the cretaceous-tertiary boundary now the difference there is you had a nobel\nlaureate in the team along with three others who were members of the berkeley faculty i\nwas with a moderately-known university portland state but i was not\nin an astronomy program or geology program i was in the systems\nprogram so\nthis was passed over at the time it was cited by some astronomers in\nthe uk \u2013 victor\nklube \u2013 for his\nown theory  actually before my results were published which\nticked me off a little saying that a comet had hit the earth around\n14,000 years ago as\nit turned out my dating was off at that time because ice cores\nwere not properly dated in those days \u2013 this was in the\nearly \u201980s when i finally found the proper dating of the ice\nsamples that i dated it turned out they were between 35,000 and\n70,000 years old so i was looking at a period in the early-to-middle\nice age rather than the part i really wanted to test actually\nthe ice was missing from the ice record from that period because it\nhad already been sampled that was the most interesting area that\nresearchers wanted to look at was at the end of the ice age so even\nif i wanted to i could not have studied that part well how do you account for that p\n why is the ice missing because other researchers sampled that very\nheavily and all the ice got gobbled up i came late in the game so\nto speak those cores had been around for at least five years before\ni started my tests but what you are saying is in essence that you did prove the\nfact that there was an escalation in the amount of iridium as you\ncalled it p\n well it was the first time elevated amounts of cosmic dust had been\nfound in the ice record in fact in one of the samples i found high\nlevels of gold which would have been if it was a mine-able deposit you could have made a lot of money in that section when was this p\n that was around 50,000 years back okay well i am not sure this is related at all but my\nunderstanding i do not know if you go back to the days of the\nanunnaki when they supposedly you know zecharia sitchin\u2019s\nwork and the fact that they were mining gold to put into the\natmosphere of their own planet to protect it from the sun\u2019s\nrays and so on the loss of atmosphere is there any correlation\nthere between your finding a lot of gold in the samples that you were\ngetting 50,000 years ago p\n well gold is also an enhanced material in cosmic dust you find\nseveral hundred to a thousand times more gold in meteorites and\ncosmic dust than you do typical of earth crust material so the\nearth i believe was being exposed to increased amounts of gold\ndust in\nfact gold nuggets could come from space you have myth stories of\ngold meteors you know where they find a nugget in fact this gold\ntends to be concentrated at the bottom of gravel deposits whenever\nthere is a flood the heavy stuff\u2019s going to deposit first\nand so whatever was coming down ended up getting concentrated by\nthese floods in certain layers but\nanyway that was one victory for the hypothesis also i was noticing\nthat certain supernova explosions \u2013 in fact this was part of\nwhat tipped me off about the superwave phenomena \u2013 that it\nwas not just an explosion at the center of the galaxy but\nsomething came out and was actually triggering supernova explosions\nas it moved out from the center oh okay so it is actually affecting stars p\n it affects stars yes stars that are near ready to explode that\nmight be on the unstable part of their history end up exploding for\nexample the vela\nsupernova remnant\noccurred at the time when this superwave was moving through our area the vela is the closest supernova remnant to the solar system that is\nof the young remnants and then the crab nebula which was 6,000\nlight-years farther away so it occurred later it is\ndocumented in the chinese records of 1054 ad july 4th  as it\nturns out that went off and it was seen you\nhave to figure that it takes time for the light to come to us so\nit is like 6,500 light-years away in the direction opposite to\nthe galactic center so you have to allow about 6,500 years for the\nsuperwave to get out there then it triggers this and there is\nanother 6,500 or so years that is why we saw it more recently when\ni plotted the new supernova remnants i found that they tend to line\nup on this event horizon as i call it it is actually an\nellipsoidal horizon when you plot it out with the earth at one focus\nand the galactic center at the other the\nreason for that \u2013 why is not it a sphere because if you\nthink of this actually the superwave travels out as a sphere a\nshell but for us we have to allow for time for the radiation to\nreach us so if these cosmic ray electrons are generating radio waves\nat some star system you have to allow time for that radiation to\nreach us what you see is that there is a shell of radio\nradiation out there that we are inside of that is being\ngenerated by these superwave cosmic rays as they go out and they\ninteract with magnetic fields and so on when\nyou plot that on a graph that model fits like a glove to what is\ncalled a cosmic radio background radiation which is acknowledged\nthat it is produced by cosmic rays but scientists did not\nreally have a good explanation of why it is there you know they were suggesting well maybe these supernova explosions go out and contribute the superwave model prediction fit better than anything that had been\npublished before is that the same background radiation that most cosmologists believe\nis evidence of the big bang p\n no that is the microwave background you are talking\nabout this is the galactic radio background okay p\n and more recently they found there is also a galactic gamma-ray\nbackground which is a diffuse emission and they cannot explain\nwhy it is diffuse they would expect if it was due to stars you\nshould see clumps here and there of gamma-rays instead it is\nvery diffuse and again i believe that is due to the shell of\ncosmic rays going out the\nthing is that most of the energy from the superwave ends up being\ndirected outward from the galactic center so once it passes you you\ndo not see it very easily this radiation that we are\nseeing that astronomers report is only when the cosmic rays end up\ngetting caught in a magnetic field and they turn their searchlights\ntowards us in\nother words they are beaming that energy that radio emission outward in the direction they are traveling but if they get\ncaught and turned around we will see some of that but that is\na small fraction of those cosmic rays we\nare very aware when it is happening when it arrives suddenly you know we are going to see a bluish-white star in the sky\nsimilar to what the hopis talk about and we will see a lot of\nactivity of sort of aurora-like things around the heliopause that shell around the solar system we will see auroral activity\nin our own magnetic field what about the effects on dna have you posited any possible\neffects p\n well if you figure the levels we are talking about because\nyou cannot postulate too great cosmic ray intensities because\notherwise if that was the case the surface of the earth would be\nradioactive like you had have huge carbon-14 levels in fact\nthat was a restriction that i had to put into my model looking\nat the levels that are reasonable you would have had a slight\nincrease of mutation rate maybe a doubling or tripling mutation rate\nat that time however it is not really the superwave cosmic rays that are of most\nconcern it is the ones from the sun because once the sun this is only in the case of very long-lasting superwaves where the\ndust has come in and surrounded the sun long enough to aggravate it\ninto what we call a t\ntauri\nstar because we see\nstars similar to our sun that are in dust cocoons that are very\nactive and spewing out coronal mass ejections and super solar flares so\nonce the sun goes into that phase and one of these very large events\n\u2013  like extinction-level events \u2013 hits the earth then\nnot only are you dealing with major mutational change but also\npossible death if you happen to be caught outside when this happens and\nit is interesting geologists have found a connection between\nextinctions and magnetic reversals and they could not really\nunderstand why is there this connection if the earth\u2019s field\nwent to zero you had get maybe a doubling of the cosmic ray\nbackground on the earth so that would not be enough to cause an\nextinction maybe it would accelerate a little the mutation rate but\nif both were due to a coronal mass ejection from the sun \u2013 it\nwas an extinction-level event \u2013 that would explain it so\nthey are both due to a third cause in that case they are\nnot directly causally related it sounds very compelling certainly to the degree that we can talk\nwith you about this on a non-scientific level as it were but what\nmeasure of support and interest have you had from the mainstream\nscientific community p\n i have been for example to the galaxy and solar system\nconference and there was also the lunar and planetary science\nconference in houston where i gave a poster\npaper i stood in\nfront of a board where i had the whole thing laid out and explained\nto people who would come up and did talk with some fairly high-level\ncosmic ray astrophysicists who found the whole idea very plausible i\nhave not had anyone publish a paper against the theory i was\nhoping somebody would because i would have nailed their ears to the\nwall i feel the evidence is so strong to support it basically in general why are not they all coming on the bandwagon well it is a major change of the paradigm the paradigm is that\neverything is calm out there we do not have anything to worry\nabout you do not want to get into catastrophism because that\nmakes you emotional emotions should not be in science we\nshould not be scared when we do science i\ndo not really get scared by this i am just studying the\npast it is something you know you are concerned it is\nsomething we should know about about our future but science has\ntraditionally stayed away from these areas anything dealing with\ncatastrophism if\nyou look at all the flack that the group from berkeley got when they\nmade a discovery about the dinosaurs being hit with a comet or\nasteroid they were attacked by many people many geologists who\nfelt that we should only do geology based on what is happening\non the earth volcanoes this sort of thing and\nthat was something 65 million years ago now you can imagine what i am\ntalking about just 13,000 years ago \u2013 or 16,000 \u2013 it is\nwithin the realm of the human race and so people are more fearful to\njoin they are wondering well if i write in support of his theory what are the consequences\nfor me but\ni have had my paper cited that i published i published in refereed\njournals in several well-known in monthly\nnotices in astrophysics\nand space science to\nname a few eos which is more of a scientific newsletter are not you dealing with also \u2013 i mean this galactic\nsuperwave you are also dealing with this kinetic physics p\n subquantum kinetics subquantum kinetics as being part of this galactic superwave theory\nin some way form or fashion if you are talking about\nsubquantum physics you are also talking about what\nis the aether made of such that the galactic superwave will impact or create how it\nimpacts space and how it impacts p\n well aether\u2019s a controversial topic which indeed subquantum\nkinetics is an aether theory but you do not have to bring that\nin for this superwave phenomenon the superwave phenomenon can be\nbased totally in the current view of physics pretty much i understand that but i am interested because you obviously\nare thinking about both things that there must be some kind of place\nwhere they link up in your own mind in theory p\n well it was really my work in subquantum kinetics that brought me\nto the discovery of the superwave phenomenon that is through a\nlong path can you explain that in sort of easy terms to understand at all p\n well i had been developing subquantum kinetics for many years i had\nbasically written up the early papers which i was at the point of\nready to submit i had already submitted to a few journals at\nthe same time in the meanwhile i was studying ancient lore back in\n1975 i had discovered that the tarot encodes concepts very similar to\nwhat i was talking about in the physics i did take a class in\ncambridge massachusetts on the tarot and as the teacher was going each arcanum now the tarot is a set of 22 cards that are used in fortune-telling but\nthey date back to the middle ages from the gypsies the earliest\ndecks are attributed to the gypsies which had migrated from india\nthrough egypt esoteric scholars believe that they had picked up the\nconcepts from the egyptian priests prior to the collapse of the\npriesthood in\nthe very early days of the kingdoms of egypt  the priests were\nin power they had an indoctrination into this ancient science that\nexplained how the universe was created that these concepts \u2013\nat that time they were frescoes on the wall of the chamber that the\nnew priests were brought in and taught the meanings \u2013 that\nthese were later put into the tarot deck can you trace one of those particular scientific concepts as\ndepicted in the tarot and how that relates to kinetic p\n subquantum kinetics well subquantum kinetics is based on process it is the idea of it is alchemical aether basically it is an aether that is not static like the 19th\ncentury aether that\nphysics grew out of but one more like closer to heraclitus concept he was an ancient greek philosopher who said that all is\nprocess the\nclosest is to think of the is not that like saying all\nis motion are not\nyou talking about everything being in motion p\n that is close to the idea but here it is more a reaction there is motion just like you have in a chemical solution you have\nmolecules diffusing from one place to another place but they are\nalso reacting basically\nit is the same understanding you have for how your own body\nworks how is it that the structure of our body is made from the\nreactions and diffusions of chemicals so\nthis is a very organic concept it is more like close to the\norganic ideas of star\nwars of the\nforce very close that\nthe galaxy\u2019s bound together the universe being bound together\nby a fabric an organic fabric it is sort of like every part of\nspace that is ether is affecting every other part of space okay and if i called it \u201cenergy would that be the\nsame thing p\n i do not use \u201cenergy because i save that for\nelectromagnetic waves it is energy-like but you cannot\nspeak of energy at the subquantum level oh i see p\n it is some there is a prime mover something that moves\nthis reaction forward it is uni-directional it is sort of\nlike the direction of time in the big sense capital t moving\nforward we have a secret witness that also talks about he is tapping into\nwhat he calls the information\nfield and when we said is that the same as the\nconsciousness field he\nwould say no because he thinks the\nconsciousness field is you know is individual-based whereas this thing he is calling\nthe information field\nwould encompass everything is\nthere any kind of way you could have a dialogue about that because\nthis gets to signal non-locality for example if you are\nfamiliar with that p\n my view is that to explain what is here we have to postulate\nhigher dimensions and a flux of aether that we cannot directly\nmeasure but only hypothesize the way you know it is there there are experiments that you can do that shows that there is an\nabsolute reference frame that relativity is wrong i give many\nexperiments in my book in\nfact the geopositioning system that the military uses is based on\nthe idea that light goes faster in the direction of the earth\u2019s\nrotation than the opposite direction if they did not accept\nthat which is anti-relativistic they would not locate people that\nare forces on the earth they would maybe bomb the wrong embassy okay so if you could explain in terms of i do not know if you\ncan do this but in terms of your subatomic model how can you\nexplain that to us on the basis of an experiment p\n well there is what is called chemical waves at the time\ni was getting the idea for subquantum kinetics they had just\npublished work on the belousov-zhabotinskii\nreaction which is a\nchemical reaction where you put some dyes in there that change from\nred to blue depending on the state of the reaction and there is\na molecule cerium which can go between two valence states as\nthe reaction churns forward cerium in one given place and space oscillates they call it chemical\nclocks so\nif you stir this up with a little stirrer your reaction will change\nfrom red to blue just like a clock and they call it the chemical\nclock but if you leave it unstirred and calm it will form little\nwave patterns sort of like a bull\u2019s-eye pattern with let us\nsay a blue center and a red ring and then a blue ring and so on an effect like meaning a spiral p\n no actual concentric rings like atlantis in my book genesis\nof the cosmos i suggest that the\natlantis myth is actually they are describing a subatomic\nparticle based on this new physics now understand that my theory came out of systems theory it was only\nlater i saw the connection with the ancient science that was being\ndiscussed symbolically but\ngetting back to the reaction this would be red and blue waves they\nbecome spiral waves in fact they were on the cover of this\nmagazine spiral waves because they are more artistically\nappealing so that is why they concentrated about spiral waves but that happens only when you give a little mechanical disturbance\nso that the rings reconnect to form a spiral i see uh-huh so how does this p\n well how does this relate i thought well this is an interesting model for subatomic particles i was reading einstein\u2019s treatise in scientific\namerican he was talking\nabout his difficulty in unifying electromagnetism and gravitation in\nthere it talked about his view that there were no such things as\nsingularities which would mean einstein himself would be against the\nblack hole theory his reason was it would disrupt the space-time\nfabric which he believed should be continuous he\nbelieved particles were places of bunched energy so to speak and i\nwas saying well here this is looking like a bunching here where you have a core with this\nwave pattern around so the core is really a high concentration of a\ncertain element and\ni was saying instead of\nworking with molecules like you do in chemistry let us come up\nwith a new name aetherance [spelling unclear pronounces it ether-ahns] i\ninitially called it sub-physical\nunits but later i said what the heck go all the\nway let us forget about the taboos the aether is an ancient concept and people were not afraid of\nusing it if\nyou look at the real experimental evidence and stop regarding science\nas a religion you know it is very religious in some ways in the\nsense that existing physicists religiously believe in their theories\nto the point of ignoring the evidence against them so\nyou can imagine this soup of \u2018etherance of different types a b c d and so on reacting according to\ncertain recipes what i did was come up with a set of reactions which\ni believed were physically realistic in\nother words they created physically-realistic particles that\nproduced electric and gravitational fields just like regular matter\nthat would obey the classical laws of electrostatics and gravitation\nthat would bind \u2013 have nuclear bonding \u2013 and also have\nspin characteristics that made certain predictions astronomical\npredictions one being that light waves that their energy should not\nbe constant but over great distances of going through intergalactic\nspace they should lose energy \u2013 in other words redshift do they p\n they do that is what is called the cosmological redshift where scientists have interpreted a cosmological redshift as an\nactual velocity effect due to a recession of a galaxy in other\nwords if the galaxy moves away it would cause this effect which is\na very mechanical mechanistic interpretation the\ntired light theory as\nit is called \u2013 the idea that light waves lose energy as\nthey travel \u2013 was proposed about the same time as this other\ntheory but the thing was they did not have a reason for it to\noccur another way to interpret it and the more mechanistic was more\neasily grasped and so they went with that that is why we have\nthe expanding universe theory today i\nwrote a paper for the astrophysical\njournal in 1986 which is\nthe top journal in astrophysics \u2013 it is the same one that\nhubble published in the astronomer they attribute the expanding\nuniverse to \u2013 and showed that if you look at the data and\ncompare the expanding universe model to the stationary universe\nmodel with tired light effect instead of motional effect you find\nthat the tired light model always comes closer to your data i\ndid it on four tests and the reason i did it on four tests is that\nwhen you adjust your model \u2013 because big bang theorists are\nadjusting their model to fit the data because it never fits the data so if they want to adjust their model it is fine with me but\nthey have to be consistent in what are its effects on these other\ntests and\nyou find that their model ends up getting pushed further from the\ndata as soon as they try to adjust it here that is why they will\nalways publish on one test and not on four simultaneously okay you are talking about tired light how does this relate\nto your theory of kinetics \u2013 subquantum physics p\n well that is one of the predictions that came out of\nsubquantum kinetics that was a testable prediction and i went ahead\nand tested it by looking at the data to see did it support it or was\nthe big bang theory correct because at that time i was just like everyone else believing in the big\nbang theory but i wanted to give this a chance and you know slowly\ni realized my god subquantum kinetics is right and all this other stuff is baloney that\nthey have been teaching so what happens tired light means you are talking about energy\ndissipating right or changing form p\n actually in subquantum kinetics the energy actually leaves the\nphysical universe in the sense that the wave just diminishes in\namplitude energy is not a constant in subquantum kinetics why because subquantum kinetics proposes that the physical universe\nbehaves like an open system what\nis an open system it is like we are an open system biological organism we must eat have input and output we must\nbreathe we take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide if those\nprocesses cease we die the\nsame with the chemical reaction model the chemical waves you only\nsee the waves as long as the chemical reactions are taking place as\nsoon as they use up the food chemicals and they go to equilibrium the waves disappear dematerialize so to speak so\nthe same for this physics \u2013 the physical universe would\ndematerialize if this flux which we should all be thankful for in my\nopinion were to ever diminish or cease well then between dimensions i mean i do not know if this\nis related but in theory between dimensions then that is\nexactly what must happen in order to dematerialize and move between\ndimensions that energy has to dissipate or come down to zero so\nthat you can move to the next because if it\ndematerializes it goes into another dimension p\n okay you are talking about a physical being like a human\nbeing wanting to maybe p\n you are talking about the soul well actually what i am thinking about is the ability for\neven ghosts or ets to go through walls and now we are actually\nseeing movies in which you know the powers that be have created \u2013\nand i do not know how they do it \u2013 but they create\ntechniques by which you can change the composition of a wall such\nthat you can go through it p\n yes this is something that is possible this model works on the subatomic level that you are talking\nabout p\n subquantum okay well then it has to work all the way up right to the fact\nthat you get to the larger particles bodies p\n yeah with subquantum kinetics you can explain dematerialization\nand re-materialization this is something that is easily done okay p\n it involves a change of the gravity potential if you were to\nincrease the gravity potential enough an object would dematerialize or at first it would become invisible which means if you look at a change the gravity such that it become heavier or lighter p\n it would be lighter okay p\n like the sun is in a gravity well the sun is in a very materialized\nstate if we were to go out into space way far from the\ngalaxy because the galaxy itself is in a gravity well we would go\ninto the area where i was saying photons lose energy this tired\nlight effect everything there would tend towards a homogeneous state\n would tend to dematerialize if\nthe opposite effect is within the galaxy instead of having light\nlosing energy it gains energy here it is the opposite and you\nhave blueshifting of light in fact i made a prediction i called up\njpl in 1980 i said have\nyou seen anything with your signals to your spacecraft microwave\nsignals maybe a slight blueshifting of the signal said well no we have not\nreally looked for such a thing said well keep an eye\nopen see what you see because if so it would support my theory so\nright about seven years later or so eight years later they start\nnoticing oh by the way i published this in 1985 as a test of my\ntheory that if you did a test sending a microwave signal from earth\nto jupiter to a spacecraft in jupiter and relayed it back you had\nfind the energy was slightly higher and i said how\nmuch because my theory\nwould predict what that amount of increase would be well about seven or eight years later they start noticing something\nis a little peculiar in our data it is becoming blueshifted it is as if there is a force pushing the spacecraft towards\nthe sun they\nfinally published this in 1998 and it became known as the\npioneer effect then they\npublished further information four years later now there have been thousands literally thousands of papers written by\nphysicists about the pioneer effect trying to explain it what it\nis there is only one paper published before it was discovered\nthat predicted it and that was in my publication of subquantum\nkinetics it was published in 1985 in the international\njournal of general systems so did jpl come find you when you were proven correct p\n i sent a copy of my book marked where i made the prediction i\nactually took a picture of the original journal and marked where it\nwas stated and also sent a copy of my book which further explained to the head man on that publication team at jpl basically\nit was ignored he did not even send me a preprint of his paper\nthat i requested so all i had was the news announcement he never\ntold me you know well it is going to be published in this journal on this page he never told me that and i was never mentioned four years later in\na follow-up paper so you know my experience is that the average physicist or nasa\nscientist or astronomer is a cowboy he is interested in his own\ntheories not in yours if he confirmed yours he is not\ninterested that is the way it works yeah it is worked like that for a long time okay but the implications of what you discovered could point to the\nreality of other dimensions as you say dematerialization actually you may be on the road to explaining how other dimensions could\nexist p\n right subquantum kinetics is a unified field theory it explains\nall the forces that unified field theories deal with and it fits\ntogether like a swiss watch relativity effects come out of it as\ncorollaries you do not have to postulate ad hoc like einstein\nwas saying there\nare now twelve predictions that were previously published that said\nthings entirely different from what physicists were saying that were\nlater verified by observation so certain things it has predicated\nwere confirmed and i do not know of anything that is said\nso far that is been disproved it\ngives you a lot of encouragement to believe that we have got\nsomething here plus the fact looking at general relativity it had\nonly three predictions that were confirmed now we are dealing\nhere with twelve plus you find that ancient civilizations had this physics they went to a\nlot of trouble to encode it in some of their most important creation\nmyths that historians have written about it is even encoded in\nthe zodiac even though the zodiac is used for horoscopes one\nof the main technologies used in field propulsion this exotic\npropulsion that is developed in black projects in fact the b2\nbomber i discussed in my recent book secrets\nof antigravity propulsion i explain how the b2 bomber uses brown\u2019s research and patents basically it is based on his ideas so\nwith subquantum kinetics it is not just explaining brown\u2019s\nwork but a whole host of other technologies too like john\nsurrell\u2019s \ntechnology  eugene\npodkletnov\u2019s\ngravity impulse beam which he is able to produce gravity impulses\nfrom electric shock discharges which are gravity impulses collimated can go for kilometers\nand kilometers staying together and\nhe is found it actually travels superluminally so this could be\nthe centerpiece of a superluminal propulsion engine from\nwhat i have seen i have seen actual demonstrations of\nsuperluminal shock propagation in the laboratory \u2013\nguy obolensky\u2019s\nwork and with this technology of podkletnov\u2019s i would say it is possible to do superluminal space travel which completely changes our outlook of interstellar communication\nand interaction with other beings it is possible that they could\nactually travel here another\nthing that comes out of subquantum kinetics is it completely changes\nwhat we think is possible for energy and you find these technologies\nwhere they are getting energy out of water like john\neckel\u2019s patent\nthat they are developing in the uk they say they will have\na hot water heater out in the next year-and-a-half or so or\nrandell\nmills invention\nproduced by black\nlight power company he is got something like 20 of these prototypes being tested\nthat he believes will produce 50 kilowatts of power for your average\nhouse these\nare explained by subquantum kinetics because subquantum kinetics\nleads to a revision of quantum mechanics there is a flaw in\nquantum mechanics even though quantum mechanics is workable the\nmodel is incorrect the wave-packet\nmodel is incorrectly\nformulated when\nyou go to the subquantum kinetics version you get the same results it explains experiments with the same mathematics essentially but\nit allows the possibility for ground-states in the hydrogen atom that\nare more levels of energy in the hydrogen atom it allows the\nhydrogen electron to jump down and release energy that we thought\nwould not be there that is what these various scientists\nhave tapped into with their inventions so\nsubquantum kinetics leads to the development of a lot of new energy\nsources that would be considered alternative energy it is hard to understand why other quantum physicists have not\npicked up your work with a lot of enthusiasm what is your\nexplanation for this is it because it is too big a scope or\nit is too grand p\n it is that it is too big a shift new theories are picked\nup if you are not changing the basic structure the basic\nparadigm if it is a new idea within the existing paradigm it\nwill be very quickly picked up if it is going to explain things\nbetter i am\ntalking about basically wiping the slate clean as far as theories go most theories most modern theories you can keep some of the classic\nequations newton\u2019s equations and so on but maxwell\u2019s equations p\n well maxwell\u2019s no it even revises that you have to look\nat maxwell\u2019s equations as a model of a phenomenon it explains\nelectromagnetic wave propagation in a different way for\none thing maxwell\u2019s equations at least the accepted version have energy being conserved it means that energy of a photon can\nneither increase nor decrease whereas here as we were saying\nearlier over great distances you will see a change there\nare a set of principles which are considered sacred in physics one\nis the first law of thermodynamics this idea that energy cannot be\nchanged only converted and you are changing that law really are you not p\n right and i can show technologies which you can perform in your\nback yard garage which show a violation of energy conservation some\nof these electrostatic thrusters like jean-louis\nnaudin has on his\nwebsite \u2013 some laforgue\nthrusters \u2013\nthey are basically asymmetrical capacitors that he is got\nin a pinwheel arrangement when you calculate how much energy he is\nputting in to drive that pinwheel it is a lot less than the\nmotion he is getting out of it he is getting out about\nthree times more motional energy than the electric it has to be an open system to go back to what you were saying\nbefore p\n the universe yeah as soon as you view the universe as an open\nsystem you have to realize that energy\u2019s not necessarily\nconserved pretty much all system theorists will agree with you if\nyour physics is postulating an open system for the universe then you\ndo have the possibility of matter or energy increasing or decreasing\nin amount in a physical universe the\nthing is that this is like just a small shadow on the sort of an\nepiphenomenon of this vast flux that is going on below the level\nof observation so that is where your real energy it is\nnot energy it is action in other words just for this table this stool or chair to be there\nrequires an enormous expenditure of action subquantum flux which is\ntotally invisible to us and we only infer that it is there\nthrough a series of conceptual models and understandings are you able to theoretically predict the physics behind an\noverunity engine as a result of this can you predict how to design\none before you start tinkering in your garage with this p\n it could lead to some predictions of that sort but the way it is\ngenerally worked with me is i have read about people\u2019s work\nin this area and find that i can explain what they are finding\nwith subquantum kinetics okay yeah sorry perhaps i did not form my question in the\nright way what i really meant was from your theoretical\nunderstanding could you predict which engineering approaches are\nmore likely to be successful p\n yeah i think so yeah i think that with this physics you can\nexplain a lot of the technologies they are developing in the\nblack projects for field propulsion i would not be surprised if\na lot of my readers are in the black projects i would have no way of\nknowing but yeah that is what i was thinking p\n they were actually working on aether theories in the \u201950s to\nexplain electrogravitics townsend\nbrown was developing\nan aether theory they were working on one at douglas aircraft which apparently they ditched and it eventually was declassified somehow maybe it was just some notes that somebody had that were supposed to\nbe classified but they were leaked out from\nconversations i have had with some black projects engineers who\nacknowledged that to them the aether is real that they realize the\nfaults of relativity when they recruit they prefer that the people\nthey are recruiting have not had their minds polluted with\ncurrent physics they try to get them at an early age that is exactly what we had heard is that they have got some\nvery very bright astute minds yeah plv and it is actually to the advantage of keeping the secrecy that\nthey would see it is good for them to keep teaching the baloney\nin the universities that they realize is wrong because what they are\ndoing is impossible in that frame of mind and it is very\ndifficult for people to get out of that it is sort of like\nasking the goldfish to discharge its tank of water it is not\ngoing to want to do that very easily oh sure but it must be immensely personally frustrating for you to\nconsider the possibility that your work may well not only be\ncorrect but be taken to levels which you had love to be in on and yet you are locked out of this because maybe they are\nconsidering they do not need you they understand it already that is the kind of expediency that they would p\n i have actually be asked to participate in one project that was\nbeing formed gotten off the ground but i saw that it was going to\nbe secret even though they were intending it to eventually be open but you never really can be sure what will be the result so why did you stand back from that what was your motivation i guess there is the risk of being locked in on the wrong side of the\ndoor p\n yeah when you start working in secrecy you feel a little stifled are you that rare thing a \u201cscientist with a conscience is that why p\n i guess you had say so yeah and is that a result of your parents influence would you\nsay to some degree or something else p\n oh yeah i would say that is part of it you know it is\njust me i guess my interest is in helping humanity i am\ninterested in the truth and not living in some dream some belief\nsystem that other people are telling you and it does not fit the\ndata also the elite in other words the elitism around using technology\nor using the truth only for a certain group of people perhaps is\ngoing against the grain p\n yeah the thing is who is controlling the black projects as soon\nas they are black i mean they are not even acknowledged\nby congress or whatever government has them somebody\u2019s pulling\nthe strings and there are some people that suggest they are not\neven from earth if you believe now can we get back to i mean you did say that you had some\nkind of contact experience that affected you are you able to\ndescribe that in some detail to us p\n well it was basically an inner experience i had when i was at johns\nhopkins in my junior year i felt that it was information coming into\nme i\nwas in a certain mental state i felt there were intelligences from\nthe plant kingdom i felt they were terrestrial that the trees were\ntalking to me \u2013 the vegetation kingdom of earth \u2013 that\nwas concerned about the way we were going they were concerned also\nabout being wiped out by the progress of human societies like we are\nout of control here with growth sort of like the movie\nkoyaanisqatsi that whole concept at\nthe same time they were giving me the basic understanding that the\nbasis of existence is flux because if you have flux you can always produce structure in\nother words if the flux goes in a loop now you have something that\nexists over time because it is the same and\nthe same whereas if\nyou start with structure structure itself does not imply flux\nbecause you are dealing with something that is static why\nshould it move it is static so\nthat is the beauty of flux and that shifted my whole\nperspective and i started on this quest of understanding nature developing my own system theory before i knew there was such a thing\nas system theory that\neventually lead into development of physics this subquantum kinetics\nwhich i developed while i was studying business actually at\nuniversity of chicago there was a course on organization theory and\nwe were asked to write a term paper the course was studying general\nsystem theory and viewing businesses as open systems it\nwas in this experience where i started melding the idea of open\nsystems with einstein\u2019s article that i had read and chemical\nwaves and so on and suddenly had this epiphany the paper did not\nend up being on business the professor who had a\nbehavioral psychological background ended up giving it to a friend\nof his who had a physics background to evaluate and the rest as they say is history because that sounds\nlike it propelled you into the direction you have gone on p\n yeah i remember i had a sort of what you had call a kundalini\nexperience during that where i was awake all night writing and then\ni had sleep during the day and get up late afternoon and be\nwalking around in the mall the university the grass area between\nthe buildings and would look at a tree and i could see this energy\nflux in the tree or the stone looked like it was alive sort\nof like the view of the shaman indians because it completely shifts\nyour perspective when you go to this it is more close to the\nhindu idea of maya that\nmaya is illusion the physical is an illusion that is just we are waves on this the real essence is the ether which is\nnon-material is that connected with david bohm\u2019s implicate\norder p\n it is close the concepts of subquantum kinetics are similar in\nsome respects to david bohm\u2019s theory but david bohm\u2019s\nworking in general relativity a relativistic framework he has not\ncompletely wiped the slate clean here i\naccept some of his concepts like his idea of stochastic fluctuations\nas a representation of zero-point energy that this is not just the\nidea of probabilism in quantum mechanics is not just some equation\nyou are writing but it has a real basis in some thing some\nmedium having stochastic behavior there in this case i would say\nit is the aether but\ni use different terms i speak of the implicit\norder and the explicit\norder the implicit order\nis the etheric order it is ordered in the sense of the reaction\npathways that are very defined the\nexplicit order is the wave order that we see that we are able\nto see we need waves to see other waves you know everything is\nwaves so that is the quantum realm the\nsubquantum is the implicit order and the quantum is the explicit\norder and the explicit order evolves out of the implicit order the\nreason why we have a particle \u2013 it is a wave pattern subatomic particles \u2013 the reason that exists is because you\nhave this cyclical yin/yang sort of reaction going on at the\nsubquantum level so it is just a manifestation of what is\nalready there it just emerges yes p\n it leads to a continuous creation cosmology sure p\n so that matter is being continuously created even this moment it is\nnot something that happened all at once like the big bang theory\nsays it is going on especially at the highest rate at the\ncenter of the galaxy but also within stars and planets well what about the idea that it is going on outside of the\ngalaxy in other like there is the theory of\nananda bosman talking\nabout what he calls the\ngreat magnetic attractor that there is other and you are saying that within the galaxy\nthere is a black hole or whatever it is not a black hole but you are saying it is p\n mother star i call it okay p\n a very old star it is the oldest star in the galaxy so beyond this because there is lots of galaxies right so\ndo you go beyond that p\n yeah every galaxy is creating matter and energy and if that\ncontinues these galaxies will grow and grow they will spawn\nother galaxies because they will eject star clusters you know every time the core explodes it ejects star clusters that is\nwhat populates the halo of the galaxy some of these if they are\nvery large ejections will actually be small galactic nuclei that\nwill end up spawning another galaxy think\nof the large\nand small magellanic clouds\nthat are very close they could have been ejections from our own\ngalactic core or maybe they just happened to nucleate close by but\nyou do see some that look like they came out of from the core of a\nmother galaxy halton arp an\nastronomer talks about this that some of these look as if they were\nejections from active cores but\neventually you could say \u2013 an extreme \u2013 maybe the whole\nuniverse becomes filled with matter and energy it is very\npossible before it would even get to that point that the set-point\nthat is causing all this creation would change you know something that might have a period of several hundred-trillion years like in the hindu view hindu\nmythology talks about vishnu waking up every so many hundred-trillion\nyears and everything dematerializes all of the maya\nis withdrawn and everyone realizes all along we were vishnu we were\nthis essence but is it possible there could be then another eruption p\n yeah this idea that not only we have cycles in terms of core\nexplosions but also the whole universe goes through a cycle of\ncreation and dissolution so you are no fan of the standard big bang theory p\n well it is interesting that they had it right in one way \u2013\nthere are big bangs but they are at the centers of galaxies there was not a single big bang creating everything and interestingly these big bangs are\nassociated with creation because the creation rate is the highest in\nthe mother star as i call it in the core of the galaxy and that is\nreally going out of control it is like a nuclear reactor going\nsuper-critical where it ends up going into a very active state expelling all\nthis matter and energy that had been created for thousands of years\nis now expelled and as this is moved away out from the core then\nthe gravity potential field that was gradually getting deeper and\ndeeper around the core now comes up a bit and it cools off the\nreaction cools off because like i was saying in subquantum\nkinetics this whole creation process is tied to the level of gravity\npotential so that is why there is a cycle involved creation\u2019s\nalways going on but then it gets really extreme and goes through\nthis outburst and then things subside it is almost like with a\nvolcano that releases the pressure that is built up underneath\nand then it goes into a quiescent period going back to maxwell and electrogravitics have you spoken with tom\nbearden p\n we met we were talking more about his free energy device which i\ndo not know if he is actually got it working at this point actually there is some concepts that are similar bearden has\nsome similar thinking on some areas to subquantum kinetics but we\nhave not really discussed it okay okay but rather than drill down there because we need to wrap this\nup is there a way we could kind of pull in some of these threads\ninto something that would kind of make sense in terms of where you\nmight be going now with your work and why p\n well like right now i am writing a paper on the mass\nextinction at the end of the ice age which i believe was due to a\nsolar cause a coronal mass ejection striking the earth i am\nhoping that by advancing in various areas it is sort of like\na front that you are pushing in various places like before i\nwas writing more on the subquantum kinetics now it is more\nclose to climatology and catastrophism in\nthe hopes that some advance will get people very excited i am\nhoping this will get them excited and attract more attention to what\ni have been saying well what about the idea of are you thinking that you might be\ngetting close to some kind of model of consciousness itself p\n i have done work on that too as the feeling-tone\ntheory model that i\ndeveloped in the \u201980s based on bill\ngray\u2019s work who is a systems psychologist psychiatrist and melded his\nidea that thought is really based on feeling-tones spirit \u2013\nreally feelings when you get down to it \u2013 and was able to\nexplain how those feeling-tones emerge into a thought using concepts\nwhich are similar to what i use to develop subquantum kinetics a\nsystem theorist can go at a very abstract level and bring stuff from\none field into another which is what i did there that theory also\nmatched very closely with a lot of neuro-physiological data a wide\nspectrum it was sort of like hitting the target eleven times we\ndid some consulting to hughes aircraft which used that as their way\nof enhancing creativity and i was later told that they saved\n$40-million dollars using this approach if you put some price on the\nincrease of creativity that resulted yeah p\n i think it is safe to talk about that since hughes aircraft\nis not around anymore in theory p\n it is all been broken up it would nice to be rewarded with a few percent of that added value yeah i mean starburst could do a lot more in contacting the\nscientific community and attending conferences if we had our coffers\nfull yeah i read for instance that there is some just routine\nscientific work that is expensive but accepted like for instance mass spectrographic analysis of ice core samples that would really\ndo a lot to bolster your theory but it just has not been done\nbecause it is so expensive and you are working on your own p\n yeah in fact this theory of the mammoths and mammals being wiped\nout by a coronal mass ejection  it was not just one there was\na series over a several thousand year period but there was one real\nmajor one that sort of ended it you\ncan test that i have located the place in the ice core all we\nneed to do then is sample for beryllium-10 and see the beryllium-10\nspike up at that time look also at carbon-14 in sediment cores these are things that can be done to test the theory so i am\nhoping once i get this published i can convince some others some\ncolleagues that we team up and do this right because that is simple stuff i mean scientifically\nspeaking that is simple stuff okay well let us say that maybe this interview will kind of\ngo towards that direction of attracting people to you that could make\nthese things possible for more investigation in all of these areas\nthat you are working in but i want to thank you very much for\ntaking the time to explain this to us in a way that we could\nunderstand it which i think you did well and hopefully we can\nlearn more about your theories and also the applications of those and\nsee what pans out in the future and we do know that are some smart people in high places who do\nwatch our videos because they are never quite sure what we are\ngoing to come out with  and they watch us quite carefully that is right and these are not necessarily bad guys these are smart guys and\nthey are good guys and it is entirely possible some of them some of them are and it is entirely possible that if your work\nhas not come fully to their attention it may just give them a\nlittle prod to take another good look at what you have to offer here p\n you know what you mentioned about you heard from this fellow who\nwas in touch with a black project or he was a black projects\nengineer and talking about space travel with superluminal spaceships right p\n i would not be surprised if part of that is misinformation i\ndo not think it was our\nsuperluminal spaceship he is talking about it was from an et\ncivilization they have been in touch with ets who told them\nthis entirely possible and that may have been entirely accidental\nbecause he may well have been relating that story second- or\nthird-hand but the principle is that he said there\nis a wave coming he\ncould not describe it exactly he was not a physicist actually he was an operative rather than an engineer he said he\nthought the timescale was more like 2017 but he did say that\nsuperluminal craft had been out taking a look at it and reported what\nwas going on he\nsaid it could i think his words were something like it\ncould just be a puff of wind or it could turn the earth on its axis but nobody really knows what is going to happen p\n well i recently deciphered a crop circle the avalon one from 2008\nthat shows the solar system the planets arranged as they would be\nin 2012 right p\n i think i remember reading something or you were talking about\nthis hey you know pluto\u2019s not where it should be david wilcock uses that in one of his talks it is obviously in the wrong place p\n right because i know one fellow who is believing that this\nmeans a superwave will arrive in 2012 and he is actually working\nwith people to build a shelter down in australia right now expecting\nthat this will hit in 2012 but\nmy reaction is why would they put that obvious error in there so i\nlooked at it and noticed in the diagram that appeared one week later\nthat shows what looks like neptune\u2019s orbit that circle and\nit is marked which seems to represent pluto\u2019s\ncrossing-point on neptune\u2019s orbit then\nit is got a little elliptical diagram with little circles as if\ndividing it in eleven equal parts and to me that is an\nelliptical exaggeration of pluto\u2019s orbit \u2013 so that we\ndo not mistake it as a circle \u2013 showing eleven\nsubdivisions of pluto\u2019s orbit if you take the period of\npluto\u2019s orbit and you divide it by eleven you come to the\namount that pluto\u2019s displaced in that crop circle okay yeah p\n and if you add that to 2012 you come to 2035 ad with the exact\ndate june 8th when that crop circle appeared in other words it\nwould have been 27 years into the future from 2008 which is\ninteresting okay p\n so what are they saying does that mean that is when a\nsuperwave will arrive will it be the time when the current one will\nend that it might arrive 2012 or what we do not know but\nthere is something on the pulsar diagram that even before this\nhappened i had written about it on my website somebody had\ndiscovered that having read my book they wrote me an email and\nsaid by the way did you\nknow that the periods you put you attracted our attention to the\ncrab and vela pulsars \u2013\nwhich are these two supernova remnants which are very important close to us and in addition the vulpecula pulsar i had stated the\nperiods for these three that they sort of form a symbolic arrow if\nyou understand the pulsar diagram as i call it \u2013 that\nthe periods are very close to the fibonacci series which creates the\ngolden mean and\nsure enough if you take the ratios of the two longer-period ones they come to the golden mean ratio to within that it is 10-5 the difference in other words one hundred thousandth is the\ndeviation from that being perfect hmm that is pretty close p\n but you notice that the crab period is significantly off \u2013 and\nthis is assuming if the second is the universal standard in\nextraterrestrial communication now because i am suggesting that\nthe pulsars are an extraterrestrial message that pulsars at 33\nmilliseconds \u2013 so it is really 34 is the number you come\nup with in the fibonacci series so\nif you say when would the\ncrab pulsar have that period where it ends up being 34 milliseconds well it is in the future by so many years and it comes out not\nvery far from this 2035 date i was coming up with something like\n2037 or so 2038 so it seems like something\u2019s going on here it is interesting right so there is some kind of message there but you are\nactually deciphering it differently than some of the 2012\nenthusiasts if you will p\n yeah i think there is not enough information to immediately\nconclude that they are telling us we will be hit by a superwave\nin 2012 although a lot of people have contacted me who have said\nthey have been in telepathic contact with ets who are telling\nthem 2012 \u2013 a\nsuperwave will arrive in\nfact one fellow said he had this et contact and they were telling\nhim about cosmic ray wave coming and he wanted to know more\ninformation about it so they said well just look up the work of paul l so\nhe did a surf on it with google and found my work i do not know if\nthis is true maybe they are aware of my website i do not\nknow up there okay so that is a great place to end thank you that is\nlovely thank you very much paul laviolette p\n mm-hm wonderful thank you mov quick time kerry cassidy (k hi i am kerry\n                  cassidy from project camelot and today we are here with jessica\n                schab is that how you say your name?jessica schab (j yes that is correct.k ok and jessica is a crystal child is\n                  what she calls herself j mm hm.k and we are really excited to be able to talk\n                  to her today so jessica tell me a little bit about yourself\n                  and kind of a little bit about your journey and she is\n                  had a very interesting time growing up and at this time you are\n                  about almost 26 is that right?j yes that is correct.k ok so why do not you tell me like the early\n                  childhood kind of thing with the relationship with your father and how you sort of tapped into all of this?j all right i was very very shy growing up i actually\n                  did not fit in surprisingly i did not really have\n                  friends of my age i actually did have a lot of grannies which\n                  i adopted i had 50 and they taught me how to knit and crochet\n                  and things like that i retreated a lot into cartoons and it really came about when i was 16 that was the big \u201ctrigger if\n                  you will before that though i do remember saying things\n                  in school like angels are aliens and\n                  aliens are angels butk so you would say this in school?j yes.k and what would be the reaction of the children around\n                  you?j oh laughter ridicule yeah mm hm k ok and why would you say that?j you know what i really did not know.k ok.j it was almost like channeling but i was not\n                  aware i was channeling k ok.j i just started sharing this information and it was\n                  even before i knew what was going on with my father so ah just thinking back to it that is kind of interesting\n                  and different k uh huh ok so what happened then i mean obviously\n                  this is what you did in the early days how did you progress\n                  at that point because i know there is a part at which\n                  you actually kind of tried to reject that world can you talk\n                  about that a little bit?j well yeah because when you first get into this\n                  information it brings about an existential breakdown you\n                  let go of everything you think you know about yourself and\n                  the world and everybody so it is in a sense a little bit\n                  of a death and also a rebirth you are an empty cup now an empty vessel to be filled.k be a little more specific in terms of your experience because i know that you had a tragedy in your life but prior\n                  to that because that happened kind of like in your late teensj yes.k you had sort of a dilemma so can you describe what\n                  your father was like and how that dilemma kind of came \u2019round\n                  in your life?j he was very distant he was connected to a world\n                  that i was not familiar with at the time and he spoke\n                  about things that i really did not understand also but\n                  he was you know very very like passionate and loving as\n                  well but um sorry i am a\n                  little nervous well i can say beforehand i was always a little bit suspicious\n                  in school i felt like i did not like being taught what to\n                  think rather than how to think it was always in the\n                  back of my mind and also just it kind of felt like\n                  i was coming off the assembly-line and i remember trying to\n                  ask about things that i i would notice that there was just stuff we were not\n                  being taught about in school for example in grade 8 they\n                  were saying the only kind of matter is gas solid and liquid and i raised my hand and i said well what about\n                  plasma and you know what she said go to detention k go to detention really?j yeah so umk very interesting and you grew up in what area?j well i was born in winterpeg but i left\n                  when i was 7 and the vancouver area the suburbs.k ok.j mm hm.k so you were told to go to detention because you\n                  talked about plasma j yes.k and that is you know i mean so they\n                  actually did not have any clue about that and we are\n                  talking what year approximately do you remember?j i was in grade 8 yes.k ok.j first year of high school and i just started to\n                  realize wait a second here there is a lot they are\n                  not saying and why cannot we talk about it why do we\n                  get in trouble if we bring this stuff up k ok.j all right?k so what happened after that?j i kinda disregarded it like i did not really\n                  pay too much attention to it it was just always in the back\n                  of the brain and it is almost like a detective  you are\n                  collecting all these bits and pieces as you go on the way and still very blind so we always we have a trigger and my trigger\n                  was when i was 16 it was tragedy my sister ended up passing\n                  away and ah her friend was drinking\n                  and driving \u2013 and it was just my sister that went so\n                  it was just her time andk ok and how did that affect you i mean obviously you know it is distressing and we do not have to\n                  dwell on it here but at the same time i think that it has\n                  something to do with your willingness to perhaps let in these\n                  other worlds would you say that?j yes because i realized that i was very depressed\n                  at that time and i was also very christian-thinking in the\n                  sense that i felt that you know everybody who parties and\n                  does drugs and things like that is bad and i do not want\n                  to converse with them not all christians think like that but that was just the way my head-space was and my interpretation\n                  of that.so when she passed away and i was listening to her friends\n                  speak about her at the funeral they were talking about\n                  this wonderful girl that i never got to know because i shut\n                  her out cause i was very judgmental so right then\n                  and there i just vowed to myself that i was never going to\n                  judge people by what they did that was not who they really\n                  were you know it is just experiences that we come here\n                  for.it was a very devastating time when my sister passed away in that it destroyed the family my mother ended up getting\n                  worse  very bad migraines i mean she had migraines before but they seemed to be more frequent and lasted longer and\n                  more severe and my father ended up getting a stroke and the family broke apart my brother went to university my other brother went to a foster home we became homeless so it was a lot all at once and you know i think i just\n                  became very traumatized you know it almost did not seem\n                  real.k ok you told me that your father had a big influencej yes.k on your sort of letting ets communicate\n                  with you.j yes k can you talk to me about that story?j yes right after my sister passed away my dad said she is\n                    come back and she started to speak to him and she\n                    started she said that it is a very exciting\n                    time to be alive the universe is like a big garden there is lots of tending here i have come\n                    back to let you know that certain members of the family have\n                    been called for a very specific mission and she was like the introduction towards a whole bunch\n                  of other beings coming through so after my sister started\n                  coming through \u2013 the catalyst \u2013 then came angels nature spirits ascended masters extraterrestrials it just\n                  got really really out-there k ok when you say this happened did this happen to\n                  you or did this happen to your father?j this happened to my father.k ok.j it all happened to my father first.k so he is very open talking to you about this?j well he was really shocked and taken aback you\n                  know it was exciting and he just had to share with the family\n                  because he did not really i do not know if\n                  he knew what to make of it at that time but he knew that he\n                  needed to share this because it was a big thing to my sister the interesting thing about how she came back was mediums\n                  can only speak to people who have passed away if they have not crossed\n                  over she had crossed over and then she came\n                  right back.k ok when you say she came right back what do you\n                  mean by that do you mean she was reincarnated in another body\n                  and coming to you from there or do you mean that she was in\n                  another dimension?j she was in another dimension.k ok.j yes the fifth and my dad described her as a\n                  very very bright white light-being appeared to him like an\n                  angel and he said it was very much her personality because\n                  she is like look dad do not i look pretty like a girl would say sok uh huh.j yeah it was you know something you gotta share something really amazing happened.k ok and what was your reaction when your father talked\n                  about this?j i was very hurt very upset because she is\n                  passed away you know it is like dumping salt on this\n                  wound you know it is just ha ha not very funny\n                  at all dad you know particularly because he had a stroke and when he had\n                  the stroke he did not know who we were he could not\n                  work you know i felt like i lost my father and so now to\n                  talk about something like this you know you are\n                  crazy you do not know what you are talking about k so he had these experiences after he had\n                  the stroke is what you are saying?j yeah so i thought points with her left\n                  index finger upward]k he must have recovered fairly well though to be\n                  able to communicate i mean he did not have like speech\n                  impairment or anything like that from the stroke?j he did a bit yeah.k ok.j mm hm.k but he was able to communicate this to you?j yeah.k uh huh.j mm hm k ok so you rejected it in the beginning what made\n                  you change your mind?j a lot of things k ok.j it was not something that i was gonna quickly be\n                  open to because i really really wanted to be normal hmm and it was never going to happen.k ok.j i just had to it took me a while to get to\n                  that but ah he wanted to tell me about his experiences and all these beings that were coming through and what they\n                  were saying and they were talking a lot about me.k ok.j and i did not know what to think of this i really wanted nothing to do with it and so i would just go to the library or the book store and books would start falling off the shelf with the same\n                  kind of context information that these beings were speaking\n                  to my dad about they had fall right at my feet and again i was still very christian-thinking so i am\n                  like this is the devil so i just ran out freaked\n                  out and it was funny thatk how did you get over that though if you were such if\n                  you had this mind-set that was christian thinking how did\n                  you sort of move beyond that?j oh i will get into that that is coming\n                  up k ok.j so i would just you know go walking down the street\n                  and people would come up to me people i knew and people i\n                  did not know and they would hand me the books again\n                   same kind of information that like the ones that\n                  my dad was talking about similar to the context of the books\n                  in the library and bookstore.and what was interesting thing about this is some of the\n                  people when i asked why are you giving me this book of you know and they are like i do not know how do you not know why you are giving somebody\n                  a book unless you are being inspired?k ok.j and i still would not look at the books and so it required those beings to be even more persistent i like\n                  to call it \u201cangelic kick in the butt where i was working i had been working in the\n                  film industry right after my sister passed away i left school\n                  because my parents they were just you know they were not\n                  able to work so i decided that you know we go to school\n                  to learn how to make money i am out of school i am\n                  out of this and i went into the film industry right away my very first\n                  day of \u201cextra work i got lines and so i thought\n                  that was normal the next day i am like when\n                  do i get my lines and they are like you do not so ah where was i going with that?k so what happened what did you do then you did not\n                  get lines are you saying you just became an extra?j i did extra work i did acting i did stunts i did\n                  stand-in i did crew work.k ok.j set dec i did as many\n                  different things to remove politics and understand where\n                  everybody was coming from that was something that i always\n                  was interested in doing is learning all the different perspectives andk ok and so when did the transition happen where\n                  you started to listen to what your father said?j on set on a show called da vinci\u2019s inquest a guy came up to me i had never seen in my entire life and he said to me is your name jessica and i said mm hm he said is your last name schab yeah and is your parents name roseanne and terry yeah how do you know all this and he is like ok this is for you and he\n                  gave me all these tapes on the cia underground militia david\n                  icke jordan maxwell alex collier and then some k ok.j and i just kind of realized that this is never\n                  going to let up something is trying to get my attention and\n                  i have to surrender.k did you watch those tapes?j i did.k ok and did it change you?j um i became very very depressed even more so because again letting go of everything you think you\n                  know but then also it seems to be this huge scary conspiracy like we are doomed it is you know this huge control\n                  game going on and there is nothing you can do about it because you do not have the power or the money or say in a sense.k ok.j yeah.k and so what did you do then how did you go from\n                  there to actually listening to your father?j hmm well after the videos and after feeling the\n                  way i did about them and just constant reoccurring of pleiadians you\n                  know ok dad who are the pleiadians why do they want\n                  to get in contact with me so i started finding out now really listening to my dad and i was not necessarily open to it but i was not\n                  necessarily closed i was just thinking that ah this\n                  is my experience for whatever reason life has taken this\n                  turn and it is for a reason so i should i should\n                  do some investigating.k ok and how old were you at this time?j i had say about 17 yeah.k ok.j a year later and my dad actually started to talk\n                  about his experiences that he actually was aware of this stuff\n                  before his stroke it was just a bigger upgrade for him but i found out that when he was 8 he was taken up on a ufo and the whole family on the farm saw this as well and they\n                  put a chip in his brain and this chip he did not\n                  believe that it was actually there he thought it was a dream\n                  or something until ah not too long ago before his stroke i believe that he mentioned he was in\n                  the hospital and there was a woman there that well she seemed to be a nurse but she was not cause\n                  she went up to my dad right away and she said you have\n                  to leave she brought him his clothes she said if \u2013 they are\n                  planning on scanning your brain if they scan your brain they will\n                  find the chip and my dad\u2019s like wait a second that is real and she said this cannot happen so come on it is\n                    time to go but my dad actually did not get out on time so right\n                  when they were about to scan his brain the whole hospital\n                  had a blackout and when the power went back on the cat-scan\n                  machine did not work and then when it did work it worked\n                  on everybody but him and that gave him enough time to make\n                  his escape from the hospital.k ok very interesting soj yeah.k now this woman did she disappear was she\n                  still on thej yeah she disappeared my dad went back to find you know who if he could speak to her again and she\n                  was only there that one time she completely vanished.k ok j and there is been a few actually events like\n                  that where these people would come to our door and\n                  my dad would say jess go follow them and i did and they just vanished k they just vanished?j yeah yeah.k so he had say follow them?j right into thin air i had turn the corner and\n                  i had see them poof k ok.j and my dad he would have experiences where he\n                  could see these beings all the time he would be in a parking\n                  lot and suddenly all these angels would be surrounding him so he had many experiences like that and he always tried to\n                  interpret it and explain it to us which was very very fascinating it started to become you know ok wow something is going\n                  on here and umk what did your father do for a living before he had\n                  a stroke?j my father was a businessman he had his own company\n                  called beverly hill homes which he ran with my mother and\n                  it was very successful and then he was a master of\n                  many things a jack-of-all-trades in winterpeg he built houses he designed them architecture-wise and he also put it together carpentry and they were very beautiful homes as well one of which i have fond memories is the castle house.and he also was a chemist he invented \u201cmendable concrete like because\n                  he was very honest and trustworthy he ended up getting taken and somebody stole that idea and took it to china and that\n                  really devastated my mother they ended up losing all their\n                  money really having nothing and then my father through the\n                  latter years he made furniture cutesy kind of furniture.k ok.j yeah.k so you are in this situation your sister has\n                  passed.j mm hm.k you are learning about ets and what\n                  happened that actually sort of progressed you to where it was not\n                  just your father having experiences but you started to have\n                  them?j ok wow well while i started to learn about the\n                  ets i am still i am actually really still\n                  upset with my father because he left the church and i was still\n                  kinda christian at that time right trying to hold onto this and so i kept going to different churches and i felt really\n                  annoyed because i could not find one where i fit in.and so i decided to explore different religions and i went\n                  to those churches still did not quite fit in there was something\n                  felt off and i could not put my finger on it so then\n                  i went into mysticism because this seemed to be along the lines\n                  of what my dad was talking about of what it seemed these beings\n                  were trying to relay to me but still that did not quite\n                  feel right and i did not quite fit in.and i knew that to try to i knew that one day i would\n                  be explaining this to people so i decided to even explore\n                  atheism again same thing i still did not quite fit\n                  in but there still i could not deny any of them either because they all\n                  seemed to be pieces of myself so what i did was i started\n                  to embrace all of them and i realized that i am not just\n                  one and to pigeon-hole myself into one is a great disservice.k ok.j so these new insights started coming through this\n                  is really where i started to see the world very differently and everyday little things started to become really big for example one time i came home and i was very upset about\n                  this reoccurring problem \u2013 like why does this keep\n                  happening to me and it is funny i do not\n                  even know what it is to this day so really big right but it popped into my head boggle go get the game boggle i am like huh boggle what the heck\n                    does that have to do with anything that is\n                    kind of a weird random tangent but i went and got it and then i got you know shake\n                    it up find some words and i found like ten and i am\n                    like all right well that is done and i do not\n                    really understand the point of this and when i put it down i got up and i turned around and\n                  i saw the board from another angle and i saw all these other\n                  words i did not see before i am like wait a\n                  second andi walked around i saw you know more from\n                  the other angle and more from the other angle till i found i think 55 and then it said ok well now you know why this problem\n                    keeps reoccurring you are only looking at it from one\n                    perspective one angle i was like oh my goodness wow and where did\n                    this come from and then it just popped into my head allow us to introduce\n                    ourselves we are your guides and every time i tried to ask them who exactly they were i got a different answer and so i thought at one point they\n                  were playing with me but in a sense they did not wanna\n                  be locked into labels in the beginning you know we introduced\n                  myself as a crystal child but you know there is indigo light-worker star-seed and also just jessica.k uh huh.j right so they are all labels when it comes\n                  down to it they are all pieces of ourself k mm hm.j i mean in school i was always told that i was stupid and i believed it.k what when you say you were told you were stupid who told you that?j my teachers why because i was put in the special\n                  classes  a \u201cslow learner drawing quotation\n                  marks in the air] and the students and because i was very\n                  dyslexic and i learned very differentlyk ok.j and i could not see things the way\n                  they did and also i did not have an interest to it is\n                  just so boring you know this is not going to stimulate the\n                  soul you know it starves that part of us.k ok so but to get back to your story you are\n                  in a position where you are starting to hear from your\n                  guides you have heard stories from your father j mm hm k so at what point were you actually sort of convinced\n                  that possibly what he was seeing was real and those personages\n                  started to be appearing for you or become real for you?j they never quite like appeared to me in the way\n                  my dad\u2019s did but i just started like what i\n                  was sharing with in school about being told i was stupid it stayed like that until you know that was my paradigm that is what everybody saw me as.until one day it dawned on me that you know someone\u2019s\n                  opinion of me does not have to be my reality and when\n                  that happened everything shifted nobody saw me as stupid\n                  anymore but it does not mean i still do not have\n                  that part like these are all facets of what makes us human so i could not really judge anybody anymore because i\n                  saw myself in each one of them no matter what they did.and what really took it to the next level actually was um this\n                  is very very hard to share but it is very important\n                  to share even though i was starting to become open to it i was still\n                  very upset with my dad because what i wanted more than anything\n                  was just a normal dad and to be a father and not\n                  to be lost to this world even though it was exciting you are\n                  still a child and you need that kind of support so i might\n                  get a bit emotional about saying thisk that is ok.j on christmas day the whole family was around and\n                  i just felt so hurt and upset by my dad that i told him i\n                  hate you why do not you just die already and he\n                  did.k okj umm and ik you say he did can you be a little more specific\n                  as to how what happened?j a week later he had a brain hemorrhage and he went\n                  in for brain surgery and he did not recover.k ok so how did you sort of view that experience?j well i knew about how our thoughts create reality\n                  before what the bleep came out this information was\n                  being given to me by my dad\u2019s \u201cbeing since\n                  i sat you know and listened to what they were saying i knew\n                  that there is a huge responsibility to what we are\n                  putting out and how powerful it is that in a sense it is magic.k mm hm.j so when i said that i was so wracked with guilt and so mad at myself and so upset with these beings who were\n                  working with me i felt that they chose the wrong person to\n                  do this mission because i demonstrated myself as unworthy you get told that this is the power that you have your\n                  thoughts create you know your reality pay attention\n                  to them and then you go and do something like that in\n                  so seeming unconscious measure.k ok but did you also allow for the freedom of the\n                  other person their sort of as a sovereign entity in other words that person being your father having a choice\n                  in whether to die or not?j i did not see that until later on see what\n                  happened was i did not want anything to do with the beings\n                  after that just because i felt so hurt by what i did that\n                  i like unworthy like i said but they still would not\n                  leave me alone and they said you do not understand you are\n                    only seeing it from one perspective you know you are\n                    feeling very hard on yourself and it is not necessary you do not understand on the soul level what is\n                    occurring even though you told him out of anger what you\n                    told him on a soul level you said it is ok dad you can go now we will be fine and that i had a contract with him that i would help him go\n                  when the time came and that he did want to leave but he did not\n                  want to go unless he knew that we would be ok and i did just\n                  that.k ok so you were able to kind of forgive yourself\n                  and allow for that occurrence to happen and to have been part\n                  of your reality in other words?j yes yeah.k ok and what about the rest of your family how did\n                  they view his passing at that point?j it devastated my mother my mother still has not\n                  recovered from it my oldest brother just distanced himself\n                  away from the family like cause he witnessed\n                  that i do not know if he even forgives me to this day\n                  of what i said to dad because he cannot understand or\n                  see it the way i do now my other brother he was upset with dad too so he\n                  actually talked about you know just not being happy with\n                  mom being with dad and steve was too young to really know\n                  what was going on.k ok so your father passed on and you were having\n                  some interactions with various beings and getting information.j yeah.k but what happened after that did it increase did\n                  youj oh yeah it just kept increasing nonstop i just\n                  had to keep i felt very very guided suddenly after\n                  my dad passed away that he planted a whole bunch of seeds\n                  within me and i needed to take care of all these seeds now i needed to make sure they had light and water andk were you sharing your experiences with your family or was this just private?j i could only really share it with my mother the\n                  other siblings were not open to it at all.k and what about school friends school mates?j no others nobody i had at that time so that is\n                  why i went on the computer trying to find people who somebody\n                  must have had similar experiences someone must know about\n                  this i cannot be the only one not just my family i\n                  mean these videos you know david icke alex collier they you know talk to other people they find them so perhaps\n                  i can do the same and how many people is this happening to who feel alone you\n                  know who cannot share this because they feel you know crazy or they will not be understood and that is\n                  really sad and not fair you know we have the right to share\n                  and express what is within us.so that really drove me and i spent many nights trying to\n                  find others to no avail until one night i collapsed in front\n                  of the computer and when i woke up there it was in\n                  the middle of the night too there was this on the computer\n                  screen it is just like meet other star-seeds\n                  and light-workers i was like ohhhh big\n                  smile] i hit the mother lode and i contacted them all and we immediately had a strong\n                  connection like we have known each other all our lives and i just knew so much about them and i did not really\n                  know how but it just was so strong and it became very exciting and i decided i wanted to go\n                  and see them and so i just started to it kind of freaked my mother out because the first one i\n                  wanted to meet was of all things a guy you know a male\n                  around my age and you think that if they are open to\n                  this information that they might they must be the\n                  one they are near your age opposite sex that is\n                  all you need!so i told my mom i am going to france to meet this guy\n                  i have never met but i am in love with and i am\n                  going even though i know that it is going to cost about like\n                  everybody\u2019s telling me three grand you know minimum i said i am going to go for less than $900 and\n                  i did when i called the travel agent she said we have nothing\n                    available \u2013 oh except this it just popped\n                    up it looks like somebody cancelled for three weeks for what was it now 850 yeah i am like that was the one that is the\n                    one.k ok and you have also done this now you have\n                  sort of followed this kind of pattern since thenj yes!k in allowing things to come to you and knowingj yes!k sort of having a second sense about that is that right?j yeah it just a strong trusting the guidance\n                  just directs you it is like the white rabbit from alice\n                  in wonderland k ok.j that is what it feels like so you just know\n                  what to do and that you will be fine you know and you\n                  can make it happen i can use all of this stuff that i have\n                  been taught to reverse a lot of the old condition-programming\n                  that is put on us when we are younger right?and it is like it is nlp [ed note neuro-linguistic\n                  programming] in a sense programming your old beliefs and your if\n                  they are yours or where they came from and\n                  using them to step into your power more and more and seeing\n                  what you can do if these beings say that we are infinite you know and\n                  that we are these beautiful balls of light then i want\n                  to experience this i want to feel this and you cannot\n                  just read about it you have to embody it is what i have\n                  come to realize and not praying or wishing or hoping for peace\n                  and love anymore  i have decided to become it you know it comes to a point in life where you decide do\n                  you want to go home or become home and\n                  then will that bring home to everybody within that is\n                  what \u201cthe shift feels like to me.k what i was wondering now if you could talk a little\n                  bit about the messages that you were getting and the kind\n                  of beings that were coming to you if you could describe them maybe specific ones that have particular meaning for you.j well it is never been quite specific like\n                  i said they have always just when i thought i\n                  could pinpoint it ok it is a pleidi no it would be something different suddenly so it was never quite\n                  about attaching ok this is jesus this is buddha it was never about that it was about the fusion and merging\n                  all of them together and that being god in itself right playing\n                  all these roles and speaking to us in whatever comfort-belief\n                  that we had so that was always my approach and perspective\n                  on it even when understanding what these aliens were \u2013 pieces\n                  of ourself as well.and so what i started to do was not only test the stuff out\n                  on my life and i do not mind sharing those experiences because\n                  they are quite wild and really fun especially when people\n                  start trying it out for themselves and then calling me up\n                  later going oh my goodness but for example what i found with the extraterrestrials\n                  is if time does not exist  past present or future are\n                  all existing at the same time simultaneously  and this is\n                  an illusion in a sense time is just a bunch of still-frames and this camera you know it is not really moving it is just a bunch of still-frames k mm hm.j and it is a trick of the eye such is the case\n                  going on within our mind as well making us perceive.then if we have been taught to believe about time \u2013 linear the way we do now  then that means there is aspects\n                  of ourself that is fragmented so future versions of ourself depending on the probability of our thinking so for example the grays  not saying all grays are like\n                  this  but when i learned that they actually are not\n                  gray at all that on a crash they dissected them and found\n                  that their gray skin was actually our color and those big\n                  goggles those big eyes \u2013 that is what they were they were goggles they were a future version of ourself that you know they feel when people feel them they feel very cold and kind of calculated and it is almost like that version of ourself of the\n                  collective thinking about you know the desensitization of\n                  war and all this cloning and genetic engineering and the\n                  chemicals in the air made us a little bit disconnected from\n                  who we really were because you know some people say that they you know they\n                  do not really feel they do not have emotions\n                  in that sense and that is an aspect of ourself and i\n                  would wonder why those ones would if you ask any little kid to draw a picture of an alien it would\n                  always be the grays with the big eyes and what i got from\n                  them was that they came back to kind of prevent us from going\n                  down that path.and it sounds very bizarre how can you know something from\n                  the future come back to us if time travel does not even\n                  exist but if an old man has smoked his entire life and he has a\n                  hole in his throat because of it a lot of the times they get\n                  inspired to go to an elementary school to talk to the kids\n                  and say please do not smoke or you will end up\n                  like me and that is kind of what i saw with the\n                  grays.so then i am like now i am going to play with\n                    the other races what about the reptiles why are people\n                    seeing reptiles and for me everything at first exists within what happens\n                  inside of us gets mirror-reflected outside there is a war\n                  going inside of our mind hence a war going on outside even\n                  our body mirrors this in that what is cancer really but\n                  one cell not recognizing another cell that is on the same\n                  team and so they fight well that is exactly what you know the americans\n                  and the iraqis and it is been played out over\n                  and over and that is why the buddhists were always saying you know peace of mind meditation clarity because oh my goodness i am gonna not go on tangents i have\n                  got to watch out for that.k ok well do not worry it has a through-line but what i wanna know is when you are talking in this\n                  way are you talking about information that has come to youj yes.k or the information you have read on the\n                  internet?j no.k are you putting these two together?j no i could not\n                  really read or study this information that much more that\n                  just honestly came to me if i did try to read i would get\n                  other stuff coming to me it was almost like whoever inspired\n                  the person in writing the literature they were speaking through\n                  me you know in acting there is the sub-text reading in-between\n                  the lines a whole other message behind it and that is\n                  kinda what i was always picking up i could never read or watch movies the same way as everybody\n                  else i never got what everybody else got i always\n                  got something completely different i never saw things like\n                  everyone else so i mean that is like even with reptiles i do not\n                  see them like everybody else does i see them as a manifestation\n                  within our mind because of the reptilian brain that is\n                  where the ego is and where 90% of the negative self-talk comes\n                  from and the repetition and that controlling factor in our\n                  mind.i do not even see the ego as something bad i see it\n                  as something that is desperate for our attention and feels\n                  like it has a duty to keep us safe and it is doing a\n                  good job but to the point where now it is making reasons\n                  why we need it and now we need protection from the protection which is mirror-reflected in our society with our system you know it was there for protection.k ok.j now we need protection from that even the pleiadians they are\n                  another mirror reflection of ourself in the future if we step\n                  into our potential our infinite potential then we will\n                  have that reality probability manifested for us so there is all these  laid out for us and\n                  it is really up to each one of us by the inner work that\n                  we do and we are responsible because we are our own\n                  self-fulfilling prophecy that is what humanity is and\n                  they have been played.k ok and what is your view if in other words\n                  when the entities ah i guess i wanna say when the entities come to youj uh huh.k and they give you information do you just\n                  accept it?j no we have a conversation almost like i challenge\n                  them i always like to challenge them and play with them because\n                  that seems to be what really stimulates them coming about \n                  in touch with your inner child you know and that creativity and wanting to understand why they are bringing this\n                  about you know why are you sharing this what is your\n                  intent behind it and i have been able to filter right away ones that are trying to sway by how they make\n                  you feel about yourself and the world around you do you feel\n                  afraid and that you need to you know protect yourself or\n                  do you feel more liberated and more compassionate and loving?k ok.j and that is how you can decipher through any\n                  message whatever thing you are watching.k ok and are you finding that certain beings return\n                  to you more than once would you recognize them or are you\n                  talking about a general you know sort of \u201cheading you\n                  know called \u201cspirit or \u201cguides or whatever you want to call it.j i prefer to use that even though yeah they are\n                  just facets of myself or you everybody.k right but given that they are if you want\n                  to look at it that way in terms of you know we can\n                  always look at the world in that terminology but they still\n                  have individuality to some degree.j but i have never really focused on that that\n                  never really interested me so much because to me that seemed\n                  to be a bit of a distraction i mean if we are thinking\n                  about we argue a lot about jesus whether he is\n                  real or not and it really does not matter it was the\n                  message that is the bigger picture so that is always\n                  what i paid attention to and i am like well even luke skywalker he is\n                    not real but boy does he inspire and reach a lot of people so\n                    that was always the way i would get past all these things just to get right to the focal point for me.k ok so what did they tell you your mission was do\n                  you know?j mmm it is when you it does not\n                  really exist when you cannot you know go out and find\n                  a place that says this is just for jessica then\n                  it is a little bit challenging so it was something that they said that i can create i can\n                  create with the pieces of what i am acquiring how i\n                  see my perspective to share that with the world and that\n                  is but do not just talk about it like be it and inspire people to find their own truth.not to say you know you need to believe what i believe because\n                    i am right and everybody else is wrong but to\n                    honor where each one is coming from and to trust themself that they have those answers within that we do not\n                    need to necessarily look and depend on other people for the\n                    answers because that is kind of what got us into this mess in\n                  the first place right we are giving our power away to\n                  people or beings that do not necessarily have our best\n                  intention in mind but even that we should ask why do not they where\n                    does that come from what part of ourself is so\n                    self-destructive that allows us to do this to ourselves k ok if you were going to talk about the future and you know a lot of people are talking about 2012 as you know and what may be going on in the future have you been given\n                  any visions or dreams of the future or any information about\n                  it from the beings that are contacting you?j definitely a lot and i always like to dispense\n                  with this \u201cend of the world kind of thing but\n                  i can understand why people see or are perceiving it as the\n                  end of the world because it is the end of an old way\n                  of living being and thinking that has been around for quite\n                  some time so to a lot of people who do not have imagination who cannot see beyond that then to them it is the\n                  end.but in actuality it is something far beyond what we have\n                  ever dreamed in a sense the best way to understand it is you know truth is stranger than fiction and we are going to experience that first-hand with these \u201cparanormal events\n                  which are not even para-normal at all it is\n                  just a bleed-through of who we actually are coming out in\n                  all kinds of different ways it is going to be more and\n                  more frequent and people are gonna start just recognizing\n                  each other and war cannot continue because we if i harm you right away i am going to feel that pain so say i punched\n                  you in the shoulder i am gonna feel it right away in my shoulder and it is going to freak people out at first because\n                  we have never really been like nobody\u2019s really\n                  taught this to us in school you know it is kind of hush-hush it is taboo in the world but it is starting to come\n                  back.humanity\u2019s you know in their state of amnesia for\n                  such a long time and now just awakening to what we have\n                  always known and it is very quantum it is very\n                  multidimensional it is memories not just of past lives but future lives multi-dimensional lives inter-dimensional\n                  lives lives in between lives we will be able to grasp\n                  that and understand that right now what is happening is it is just stepping-stones\n                  that is leading us there and you cannot get attached\n                  or box yourself into one belief there are no limits just\n                  beliefs so you always got to expand on that.k ok so when you say past lives future lives j mm hm k etcetera have you been given a vision of\n                  your own past lives future lives are you saying that this\n                  is something that you think is going to be revealed to you\n                  eventually?j i do not have very many past lives per se because\n                  i do not i know i have been human on this\n                  planet mainly i have been a guide working on the etheric so i am here to help people understand their guides and\n                  the mechanics of how they work and all the ways they are\n                  trying to get through to us and relay their message and so that is my past lives i have had one in atlantis and one in france so not very many it is very bizarre to be in a human body\n                  and just getting used to the physical and the matter kind\n                  of thing but it is a huge honor to be in the physical\n                  form on earth at this time and i have been taken and i have seen this\n                  line-up of souls that just cannot wait to be here on earth\n                  at this time and that is actually why the planet is over-populated it is because of the excitement from all the souls and this planet is like a harvard university for creators-in-training and it is one of the greatest honors to be in physical\n                  form during this time because it is the merge of spirit\n                  and matter working together and going and having these kinds\n                  of experiences because it is very different i mean i can speak\n                  about this other side i can explain to you how they interpret\n                  us it is almost like we are a \u201creality show to\n                  them and what we do affects them as well it is like\n                  a huge ripple effect it is all a microcosm of a macrocosm as we step into that.k ok so can you talk about specific events in the\n                  future or is it completely unwritten in your view?j it is not necessarily specific events because\n                  it is again it is on the collective term but i just whenever i think about it or tap into it i just see a very different world from here i see people more connecting with nature understanding the\n                  wisdom that is there that you know that it is\n                  never lied to you \u2013 nature  and it never will because\n                  it has no game to take power over it has no desire to do anything\n                  like that it just gives abundantly.and we will discover ourselves through that and it is\n                  just going to be nothing but beauty to be honest there is no doom or gloom or fear or anything like that and call yourself on that and ask yourself why why are you\n                  getting that where is that coming from is that you or is\n                  that an outside influence?k ok and if there was something you could tell people\n                  that you know because we have spent almost an\n                  hour with you here and we are gonna kind of wrap this\n                  up but if there is something you could tell people that\n                  you feel maybe has not been said so far what would that\n                  be?j be aware of what you are projecting out into\n                  the world constantly be aware of your thoughts and be gentle and kinder to yourself it is really just that the reason i am here right now sharing is because you hear\n                  about the younger generation that you know these crystals and the indigos but where are they well we are\n                  here now and your children they know all about this and\n                  i am also inspiring and having i am almost\n                  like a pioneer that is allowing the other children to\n                  come forth and speak and share.but it is not just \u201cchildren children it is\n                  also each person\u2019s inner child and that when\n                  we balance and merge our divine masculine and our divine feminine\n                   since masculine has been the energy that is\n                  ruling the planet for quite some time and now feminine energy\n                  is starting to take back its power  but no one has been you know put down more than the inner child and it is\n                  time for them to step to the plate it even mentions this in the bible only one that possesses\n                    the heart of a child may enter the kingdom and a child will lead the way and what i gather from this\n                    is a child is like our sunshine that is what we call our\n                  children you are my sunshine and when we merge that\n                  masculine and feminine within us there is peace then the\n                  union happens  the inner child is birthed and that brings\n                  such a bright light within us that when i see the stars it is a mirror of you know we\n                  are light in dark places as well and when these lights all\n                  recognize each other we all come together in one then it\n                  looks a lot like the big bright light like the sun or god\u2019s\n                  son if you will the return of god\u2019s son.and the other thing i really wanted to share with you is our\n                  perspective on the illuminati or any kind of forces that are\n                  causing a lot of discord  to understand that humanity is\n                  conditioned to believe they are a worthless piece of coal\n                  under extreme heat and pressure and the heat and pressure\n                  can be perceived as the illuminati or anything that causes\n                  discord what happens to a piece of coal under extreme heat and pressure it becomes a diamond so they are doing us a service in helping us step in and take back our power there is\n                  a major motivation force that is alchemy even if humanity\u2019s\n                  a sea of potential and in order to grow into its loveliness\n                  it needs a lot of fertilizer dumped on it  shit.i wanted to also say about the illuminati that i really see\n                  them as a bully in high school that they are very insecure\n                  and very afraid more so of us than we are of them and to\n                  me i just see them as the wizard of oz that they are\n                  smoke and mirrors great and powerful but when\n                  you get to the root and the heart of the matter it is\n                  a frail old man behind the curtain click\n                  here for the\n                  video interview  \u00a0\n\n\nkerry\ncassidy (kc okay rich dolan how is it looking richard\ndolan (rd i think we are ready bill\nryan (br you are ready to go okay we are going to tell everything we know about rich dolan because we kind of know him well he is\nsuch a political guy that he has his hand on the political pulse and\nhe is got a brand-new book out bill has actually read it i\nhave not had time lately i read his other book though and i\ncan tell you he is a wonderful writer ufos\nand the national security state\n\u2013 we have been waiting forever\nfor the second volume and finally it is out and apparently it is\nabsolutely phenomenal rich\nis just an amazing guy let us see do we say rhodes scholar\nfinalist whatever and historian brilliant brilliant mind very\nlevel-headed politically-astute he is also himself an\nintuitive he does not tell you that but he is and i have\nknown him from before camelot so i have to say that i actually tried\nto spur him on to more radicalism i\nknow we have to move things along bill okay bill why do not\nyou do the official introduction i think i have pushed around\nenough dirt here that was the unofficial one okay the official introduction is very\nbrief twenty years ago i read timothy good\u2019s above\ntop secret which was\nknown by many in those days as the\nbible of ufology that is\nthe book which you give people who doubt the reality of the\nphenomenon and then you say okay read that and we will talk again now\nthere is a new book that supersedes this in every way and as\nkerry was saying it is not just one book it is a trilogy and rich has just published the second of three volumes 638 pages it is the second volume which takes it from is it \u201978\nto 73 to \u201991 73 to 91 73 to \u201991 \u2013 some very interesting years in\nufology and volume 3 is from \u201991 to the present rich\nhas got no other role here than being an academic historian with all\nthe combination of intellectual rigor and thinking outside the box he is surfing on the waves of history itself here chronicling\nthese times which are unique in the history of the human race we\nbelieve i believe that richard believes this too and he knows\nprobably more about this subject now than almost anybody else on the\noutside of the inside on the outside of the national security state i am not going to say anymore richard take it away and tell them\neverything you know you have got one hour okay thanks very much it is a pleasure to be here i had like\nto thank bill and kerry for that very gracious introduction and other\npeople here at camelot who have made my trip here a lot easier\nand more pleasant i thank them also i have\nalready enjoyed meeting a number of attendees here as i have\noften felt that \u2013 i absolutely mean this \u2013 i learn more\nat the conferences i think than you do from me the reason is that\nthere is never a lack of brilliant people who know an awful lot about\nthis and they typically will come up to me some of them will come\nup to me during the conference and proceed to tell me these\nincredible things so it is always worthwhile for me to come\nhere and i also just enjoy meeting people i do have a new book out it is\nthe second volume of ufos\nand the national security state i do have some copies here i hope i brought enough but the book is\neasily available now at my website [ www.keyholepublishing.com\n] and on www.amazon.com and i will be talking a little bit about that for\nmy quarry today i have titled my lecture exopolitics\nin a new key creating a fresh roadmap i do not know if that is a bit ostentatious or not i wrote\nit on the plane on the way out here so literally it is a\nbrand new lecture so\nlet us begin i have got three basic themes that i want to\ncover today first i do want to talk a little bit about my book not\nto market it but really because it is relevant toward the\nlater theme that i want to discuss today i have\ndeveloped some thoughts over the last several years about\nexopolitics i have never written explicitly about exopolitics but for various reasons i am often asked to comment on exopolitics i\nhave for example spoken at every one of the steven bassett\u2019s\nx-conferences in fact i think i am the only person who is spoken at all\nof them and i have attended and spoken at all of the national\npress club events that he is had so that is something of\nan exopolitical event and that is put me within that whole\ndiscussion so i have some thoughts about exopolitics which i think are my own and\ni had like to share those with you today and i had like to\nwrap it up continuing along those lines with my own thoughts on\nwhere we are headed as a society as a civilization  indeed as a\nspecies i think it all works together rather well so we are a\nlittle bit behind schedule and i will move right ahead my\nnew book is subtitled the\ncover-up exposed it took\nme about five years to write this book actually it is\nimpossible for me to know because my first volume went through two\neditions the second edition came out in 2002 and people \u2013 back\nthen i was brand new in the field at the time \u2013 and people\nsaid oh that is a\npretty good book what about the rest of the story and\ni thought yeah i have to\ndo that do not i but then i wrote a lot of articles and i did various public speaking\nvenues and so forth and i estimate about five solid years of\nworking on this particular volume it\ntook a lot out of me in a lot of ways to be perfectly candid with\nyou it was a hard book to do harder than the first volume i wrote i was lucky because after that first book came out a lot of people\ncame out of the woodwork and offered me their resources i\nhad one very very dear friend of mine an elderly gentleman who when he passed away left me his entire immense library of nearly \u2013\nthe shy side of 1,000 books not to count numerous journals an\nenormous enormous library collection which i actually read i went\nthrough all the journals you\nhave to understand when i read these things i am very\nmethodical if you know me so when i read a book i do not\njust read it and say oh\nthat is a good book i have my notes and usually my word processor and i take notes all\nthe way through every little datum that i think is interesting goes\nin the notes with the citation page\n77 of this issue of this journal whatever and it goes in so that i put them all together into an\nenormous database my\nufo database is equal to i think about a 3,000 or 4,000-page book\nand it is from that that actually i put all my narrative\ntogether so it comes from literally hundreds and hundreds of\ndifferent sources dealing with ufology but also dealing with\npolitics and geopolitics and para-politics and whatever else you want\nto call it and all other sundry weird things that strike my fancy and it all goes into my database so\nthen when i come to year say 1977 i will look at everything\nfrom that year and it all comes together in a way that i would not\nprobably have otherwise thought to do that is how i write my\nbooks it is not what they teach you in graduate school but\nthat is what i do this\nis a pretty big fat book it is a little over 600 pages i have\ngot lots and lots of end notes and index entries in fact the other\nway to look at this is a series of a little over 200 specific\narticle-length sections that i have tried to weave together each\nsubsection of this book i think can just be taken independently and\nread as its own unit so if you had a particular interest in one\nlittle thing you could open the book and read that but they all do\nwork together if\nyou are interested in more information about this you can go to my\nwebsite which is www.keyholepublishing.com\n\u2013 just like looking through a key hole an image i have\nalways enjoyed regarding this topic what\ni tried to do in writing all books and all articles that i have\ndone and all public appearances that i have ever done is to try\nto provide a reliable guide to our past  our recent past in\nparticular it is\nlong been my feeling that our past is somewhat unknown to us and if\nwe are going to proceed as a responsible society we have to\nknow our past much\nof our past exists in the form of official government documents and\narchives you may not know this but in fact it is now widely\nunderstood that the vast majority of u.s government documents ever\ncreated remain completely inaccessible to you and to me they are\nclassified in other words a large \u2013 not a little but a large\n\u2013 majority of our own history is off limits to us this is not\njust ufos this is everything we\nare in a very very difficult and dangerous state when the large\nmajority of our written documentary history is not available for us\nto study there is a very serious problem with that so what i have\ntried to do with the ufo topic is my part in salvaging our history literally that is how i look at it i do not know how\ncomplete it is but it is as complete as i am able to make\nit toward\nthat end i have used the largest amount that i am able to\nof government documents that is proven documents that you cannot\nmake an argument against journals reliable journals or at least in\nmy opinion good journals and that includes journals by ufo\ninvestigative organizations doing on-the-spot investigations a wide\nrange of such journals various books of course and\ni have done a lot of interviews for this particular book i\nactually do not know how many individuals i interviewed maybe a\ncouple of dozen maybe 20 or 30 people directly involved in the\nevents that are in this book i either met with in person or did\nextended telephone interviews or conducted correspondence with and\ngot their stories directly and all of it again trying to weave\ntogether as reliable an account as i can i\nwant to emphasize that everything in this book with a couple of very\nspecific exceptions is verifiable data now there are some\nexceptions any\nresearcher as i am sure you will understand who is been\nin this field long enough is going to have individuals that come up\nto them and say i\nappreciate your work i have this bit of information that i would\nlike to share with you here it is but you have to promise that you\ncannot give up my identity i have a sensitive position etcetera etcetera and that\nhappens that is life it is unfortunate that it has to be\nthat way but there it is now any time a researcher gets that information and then repeats it keeping the anonymity of the source of course it is a\ndifficult situation because it puts you the recipient of that\ninformation in an unequal position this is something that i never ever believe in doing my\nattitude as a writer and as a communicator is that we speak as\nequals so that anything that i know you should be able to know as\nwell that is how it should be that is how good history that is how good science is done so i try to go easy with that i am\nsometimes distressed by some researchers in this field and i am\nnot really going to name names i am not interested in doing\nthat today but there are people who really do this to excess in my\nopinion maybe\nthey feel they have no choice they feel that they have to get the\nword out but the problem is that when you do this you are not\nnecessarily helping the public discourse on this what you are\ndoing instead is creating a lot of uncertainty about it so we are in a difficult position we have what we feel are certain\ntruths and realities that we want to communicate to the rest of the\nworld which we feel is in the dark and asleep i think that is\ntrue but\nwe have to be aware of who we are speaking to when we engage in this\nkind of conversation we have to be as responsible about this as\nwe are able to be and not unduly place the public\u2019s trust\nin what we have to say but rather as i have been saying the\npublic should be able any time to check and verify the things that\nwe say okay enough said on that this\nbook really is as i see it three major themes that i tried to weave\ntogether the first theme is what we might call the encounters something of an encyclopedic account of this particular 18-year\nperiod of ufo history so if you had an interest in the travis walton event you could read\nabout it in my book and my hope would be that you would read the\nbest most concise most complete  great account of it in\nroughly \u2013 i think about 10 pages i spent on travis walton \u2013\nthat you would find anywhere or on the hudson valley waves of ufo\nsightings of the eighties ditto or the\nhessdalen case in norway or the bob lazar\nphenomenon in the late \u201880s or anything else that happened in\nthat period of time my\ngoal was that you could use this book as a reference and a reliable\nguide and know what you needed to know learn what you needed to\nlearn so that was the first and that is a lot of the book the\nsecond major theme though i guess would be the politics obviously\nthere is politics to this so what i tried to do again is\nlearn and analyze the primary military and intelligence community\ndocuments that describe this  not just those of the united states incidentally but trying to gain the attitude of responsible agencies\nfrom any and all nations that encountered this the\nsoviet union figures heavily in this book as does to some extent\neven china the european nations most definitely and other countries\nas well australia africa  middle east they are all in\nhere and\nto the extent possible i have tried to weave their take on this\nand their attitude in here  attitudes of various presidents of all\nthe presidents presidential policy that is relevant to the ufo\nphenomenon the man in the center of course is david rockefeller he is in the book i will\nget into that a little more in just a few minutes the\nthird major theme or strand of this book would be the research in a\nsense this book is a history of ufology which is a fascinating\nstory in fact of all the things that i researched in doing this\nbook there were times when i felt that this to me was personally\nthe most interesting back\nin the old days when i was in my late teens and early 20s i was\nstudying history and english literature that was my dual major my\nfocus in history back then was what is called intellectual\nhistory it is kind\nof like the history of ideas i have\nalways been interested in that and really it occurred to me in\nwriting this volume that the story of ufology is a part of\nintellectual history without a doubt and this is a story that i\nfeel in reviewing the literature really had not been done in a\nsynthesized coherent way i\nthink this book is actually a first true history of ufology we will\ncome to that again in a moment there is\na backdrop involved in this book and it is one of global\ntransformation you have for example geopolitical transformation the breaking up of the soviet union by 1991 at the end of this\nvolume you have the birth of personal computing and even the\ninternet before the end of this particular period and you have\nthroughout \u2013 i tried to look at what we might call advanced either open or covert cutting-edge technologies the image on the\ntop there\n is the\nfamous arv \u2013 alien reproduction vehicle i\nthink i saw\ngordon novel here in\nthe audience gordon hello if you are there so in other words there are things in the larger world at large that\naffected this story and again i tried to pay as close attention to\nthem as i could so i just wanted to expand a little bit on each of\nthose three themes and then move on to the next part of this talk the\nencounters the thing that strikes me when i reviewed the cases\ninvolved the ufo encounters that took place is the quantity\nof well-documented just astonishing mind-blowing encounters that\ntook place military cases galore hundreds and hundreds of them i\nwas fortunate in getting access to a database provided to me by the\nresearcher and former aerojet\nemployee ron regehr ron worked on he was involved in building what was called the\ndsp satellite that is defense support program satellites a\nvery interesting kind of satellite in which ron argued i think with\na lot of persuasion that they are designed perfectly to be\nufo-spotting devices in\nany case ron was able \u2013 accidentally but legally  to obtain\na list of dsp tracks of fast\nwalkers during this\nperiod of time in other words fast\nwalker being the code\nword for ufo in the upper atmosphere in space there\nwere i am trying to recall from 1973 to 1991 about 283 i\nthink that is right fast\nwalker trackings by the\ndsp satellites during that period of time it is like one every\nmonth or more 15 a year i believe a couple of them were really\ninteresting one in which an object came in from space and did a\nu-turn in the vicinity of one of the satellites there\nwas also a dsp tracking of a ufo during the spectacular 1976 iranian\njet fighter intercept many people are familiar with this and i again cover this at length in my book to\nmake a long story short in september 1976 over the city of teheran\n\u2013  and of course this is back in the days of the shah when\niran was an ally of the united states \u2013 a large number of\nteheran citizens saw this very unusual object in the evening sky they called the local airport the\nair traffic controller person at first thought it was silly then he\nwent out and looked  and saw exactly what people were\nreporting and he called the iranian air force they sent two f-4\nfighter jet interceptors in succession and we know all about this\nbecause \u2013 we know a lot about it because \u2013 we have a very\nextended defense intelligence agency memo describing this in\nfascinating detail what\nhappened is that in each case of the f-4 encounters when they got to\nwithin a range of 25 nautical miles of this object \u2013 which they\ntracked on airborne radar which they saw visually which astonished\nthe pilots each of them \u2013 when they got to within 25 nautical\nmiles their key electronic systems went offline in one case right\nbefore one pilot was about to fire a missile at this object it\ndisabled the missile system it\nso happens that we have dsp tracking data of a fast\nwalker in exactly that\nspot at that time  pretty interesting confirmation indeed back\nto the quantity of these encounters and what we find is just an\nenormous amount of unexplained events going on that any responsible\nresearcher would have to inquire about forget the issue initially of aliens the\nbiggest frustration i have when i talk to skeptics about this is that\nthey jump ten steps ahead of the argument and they will say\nsomething like well\nthat is impossible because it is impossible for aliens to\ncome here from another planet do not you know anything about\nastrophysics or space\ntravel or the impossibility well okay i cannot argue that and i know as well as the next person\nthat we do not have a way ourselves of getting to the nearest\nstar not officially but\nnevertheless the real issue is in looking at these ufo reports and\nthen trying to make sense out of them sure it is easy to just\nsay it is impossible but the question is what\ndo you do with the\nreports what most people\ndo is they ignore them of course that is the easy thing a\nnumber of other very interesting developments during these years abductions i actually write quite a bit about that phenomenon and\nagain i am going to come back to that shortly the\nmutilation phenomenon is\nthat or is that not related to the ufo phenomenon i think it is crop circles ditto i think that there is a\nrelationship there and all of these i tried to deal with as well as\ni could so\nconcluding provisionally regarding the encounter thread of this\nbook there is a lot of conclusions we can make let us\nkeep it simple there is\nan overwhelming evidence for ufo reality to\nme if i were to have the opportunity to speak to somebody on nbc or\nsome major network this is the message i think that i would\nemphasize \u2013 that let us take one step at a time here and\nthe evidence is overwhelming this was my first primary goal in\nputting this book together was to lay that evidence out as\npersuasively as i could the\npolitics i am going to expand a little bit on this let me just\njump put all of these out there and we can talk about them there\u2019re\na lot of themes in my book that deal with what we would call the\npolitics of ufos each of the presidential administrations i tried\nto deal with i did deal with 1973 we had richard nixon still in the white house there is some\npretty good nixon ufo \u2013 there is one great\nnixon ufo story that is the nixon jackie gleason story and\nthat is in my book jimmy\ncarter and the whole oh skipping gerald ford through carter through the reagan and bush years  it turns out that each of these\npresidents has some fascinating connections to ufo history so that is\none aspect of it then\nthe military intelligence-community-confirmed documents inform a lot\nof this book as well one thing that is very clear from looking at\nthe mass of that data is not simply that the phenomenon is real but\nthat they were very very concerned about this phenomenon it\nmakes perfect sense when you are in charge of managing security\nover an air force base and an object that you cannot identify is\ncoming over your base doing things that are not supposed to be\npossible for\nexample in the wave of airspace violations in 1975 along the\nnorthern us border into canada over many bases with the strategic\nair command triggering maximum-level alerts sirens going lights\nflashing and all of that with objects hovering 500 feet over weapons\nstorage facilities yes it happened and it happened multiple times during a brief period in\nlate 1975 and we know for sure that this excited the concern of\nresponsible agencies we learned about this because we were at a very\nunique stage in american history in the late \u201870s and that was\nwhen the freedom of information act was actually kind of sort of useful back\nin those days \u2013 this was the early carter years \u2013 jimmy\ncarter had a very liberal attitude about foia and did promote a\nrelative amount of openness in relation to these government\ndocuments there is\nstill a great deal that was never released and in fact of all the\nfreedom of information act documents we have almost none of them\nwere of the level of top secret or above the highest good ones we\nhave are classified secret and below there is a couple of\ndocuments we have that were top secret and they were all excised blacked out or whited out so you really cannot read what is\nin them but\nnevertheless a lot of good information came out and during that\nperiod we learned about these airspace violations in the mid \u201970s during\nthe late \u201970s early \u201980s there is overwhelming\nevidence to show that intelligence groups infiltrated ufo research\norganizations they clearly did this earlier as well but my\nargument in this book is that circa 1979 1980 there is an active\neffort by agencies once again to infiltrate the field and to stir up\nthe mud and make it essentially a lot more difficult for us to know\nwhat direction is up and what is down but\nthere is more than this one of the things that i brought into\nthis volume that i really did not do a lot of in my first book because i do not think i was there mentally myself ten years\nago is what i would now call the larger geopolitical realities forget\nufos for a moment i think that most people can now recognize that\nthe united states president is probably not the guy in charge of the\ncountry okay so we all know this so then the question becomes well who or what is and that is a harder question sometimes to answer certainly\nthis is not a question that i see getting raised in the standard\nhalls of academia i do not see this raised in political science\ndepartments or history departments around the country or beyond i\nthink that they are still stuck in a much more conventional\nmindset but\nthe fact is what i try to do is analyze each of the presidencies and\ntheir relationship to the elite organizations \u2013 the infamous\nbilderberg group cfr trilateral and so forth is there a\nrelationship well the answer is absolutely 100% yes absolutely yes not maybe but yes\n\u2013 and this is important the\nkingmaker of the united states for the past half century easily has\nbeen david rockefeller you do not get to be president until he\nsays you are going to be president gerald\nford was a five-time bilderberg attendee back in the sixties he\ndid not just come out of nowhere to become the first unelected\npresident in american history jimmy\ncarter is probably as most people in this room know was lifted\nalmost directly by david rockefeller and zbigniew brzezinski and\ndropped into the white house that is really the case i mean jimmy carter interviewed with them before he got\nthe democratic nomination they were impressed by him they said yes you are going to\nbe our man brzezinski of course became his national security adviser and he is now of course one of the key advisers and point-men for barack obama some things never change the\ninfluence of the trilateral commission in the carter administration\nwas actually much commented on at the time and 1980 presidential\ncandidate ronald reagan made a lot of political capital out of this\nfact ronald\nreagan in 1980 sounded a lot like ron paul did last year believe\nit or not  he really did ronald reagan campaigned in 1980 against\nthe elites campaigned against the council on foreign relations campaigned against george herbert walker bush in that regard and said\nin fact that man will\nnever be part of my administration well it so happened that ronald reagan\u2019s campaign manager was one\nwilliam casey a key leading cfr man and a close friend of the\nrockefellers and all of that changed obviously when ronald reagan\nselected bush as his running mate causing a number of long-time\nreagan supporters to walk off the stage at the republican nomination in fact a\nmonth or two after that in september of 1980 ronald reagan had a\npre-victory campaign party september of \u201980 and seated to his\nright was david rockefeller himself so that is how it all\nworks i\nhave some points even that i make on the assassination attempt of\nronald reagan by john hinckley jr son of john hinckley sr who was\na very close friend of george herbert walker bush  a very\nclose friend hinckley\u2019s\nolder brother scott hinckley that night the night of the\nassassination attempt was due to have lunch with neil\nbush son of the vice\npresident  very interesting indeed a confluence that major media\nreally did not delve into at all okay moving ahead then to other themes well before i leave this i will just then say that the united states presidency as i\nargue that the u.s president let me put it this way is\nessentially a sales rep and his job is to sell you really two\nthings these days the\nfirst thing that he is got to sell you is globalization which\nis a bitter pill for many americans to swallow so he is got to\nbe good at that and\nthen the other pill he is got to make you swallow is whatever\nnew war comes down the pike and they do this on behalf of\ninternational financial groups one\nof the other things that i will mention before moving on is that i\ndid a brief but i think concise analysis of the gulf war it is\nnot a ufo event per se but it is important it is important in order for all of us\nto remind ourselves that we need to take the veil away and see our\npower structure for what it is and the reason is that if we are\ninterested in what we call disclosure and openness from our\ngovernment then we need to know exactly what that government is we\ncannot go through our lives rerunning our 5th grade civics class\nversion of the government in our mind you know that version you\nvote for your member of congress \u2013 this was all on schoolhouse\nrock if you lived\nthrough that \u2013 your member of congress and then how a bill\nbecomes a law and checks and balances let us not forget that and on and on and on that is\nreally not our world anymore we are in a different world and we\nneed to understand the true structure of power as it exists so this\nis an important part of what i try to do in this book the\nother aspect we will loosely call it under politics would be\nthe technological considerations again asking a question which i\ndo not have a complete answer to this the\nours versus theirs issue so if you see a ufo  who\nmade it did we make it did they make it it is\na hard issue always to resolve at least in my own view i try to\nlook at this by understanding what was the state of our official\ntechnological achievements at certain periods in the history of this what were the possible states of achievement in the black world in the covert world in trying to piece this\ntogether black\nbudget matters and privatization of the secrets also figure into my\nbook what is the black budget well i think you all know it is\nnot just classified federal spending though i\nthink there is a lot more that goes into what we call the black\nbudget i think there is a great deal of what we would all call\nillegal money\ngoing into black budget into what we would call special\naccess programs or waived\nspecial access programs or unacknowledged\nspecial access programs there is actually a whole host of other\nprogram names that i have come across in my research they\nhave little to no \u2013 let us say no\n\u2013 oversight by congress they have little to no oversight sometimes by their own agencies whether it is the navy army or air force or any of the intelligence groups who knows who runs\nsome of these things it\nappears that there is a lot of illegal money flowing through whether that is narco-trafficking dollars or securities fraud stock market fraud you know flowing through our government like the\nblood in your veins and\nby privatization of the secrets what i mean is again forgetting\nufos for the moment i think it is not hard for all of us to see\nhow government agencies \u2013 and this is not simply the u.s have become completely dominated by private money i think we can see\nthis and so it is also the case with the ufo secrets one\nof the points that i make \u2013 and some of this not all of it does come from a couple of sources that unfortunately i am\njust not at liberty to say who these people are \u2013 but i have\nbeen given information that i think is valid it indicates a massive\nrunaway nature of the ufo secrets in the hands of private semi-public but often very private interest groups certainly\nwhen you look at the special access program \u2013 that whole world\n\u2013 the few studies that have been done on it do indicate that\nprivate contractors are the dominant partner rather than dod\npersonnel who function for their part primarily as gatekeepers for\nmoney to flow in but the actual decisions are run by whether it is\nboeing or lockheed or saic or raytheon or whoever is running the\nprograms they are the dominant ones and\nit makes sense because  think about it if you are a pentagon\nfour-star general when you retire who is going to hire you well those companies will at a nice cushy job making a lot of\nmoney and all this revolving\ndoor that goes on it is\nalso very much easier for keeping the secrets when you privatize\nthis because the information then does not become classified \nit becomes proprietary which is a much much better way to keep this\ninformation from the public and it becomes profitable of course if\nyou assume as i do as i have come to believe that much of this\ninvolves retrieval of acquired technologies exotic technology not\nmanufactured by human hands so then you have got this little\nartifact that you have got to study and you may not be able to\nduplicate it right away but you might after ten years come up with\nsome pretty nifty ideas on what you can do and you have got a\ngreat money-maker there so\nreally the incentive for giving the secrets up becomes less and less\nand less over the years so it naturally becomes private of course\nit does so the obvious conclusion \u2013 this is the kindergarten-level\nconclusion of the politics portions \u2013 is that there is an\nactive international cover-up of the core of the ufo phenomenon there is obviously much more that i try to say regarding that but\nagain if there is a single take-away message that would have\nto be it it is a\nreal phenomenon and yes virginia there is a cover-up the\nresearch i will get a little bit more into this as i say it is a history of ufology a fascinating bit of history it is in a sense you might say that the history\u2019s a part of the\nhistory of the development of human consciousness think\nof it this way we have had this phenomenon that is observed\nus for who knows how long right and it is really during i\nbelieve the seventies and then the eighties when researchers in a\nsophisticated way tried to understand who these other beings were it is our attempt in a sense to turn the tables and understand\nwho they were sure there were researchers in the fifties and sixties i do not really\nthink that researchers in the fifties and sixties were quite there in\nasking the kinds of questions that came up in the seventies something\nof an intellectual revolution in ufo research took place during these\nyears a lot of new issues came up that had not existed before the whole concept of crash retrievals became big there was a lot of\nresistance to it it is a story again that i document the\nstory of those people who tried to bring this issue to the fore and\nthose who said no that is\na lot of nonsense it\nwas a very heated issue \u2013 it still is to a lesser extent in\nthe seventies and eighties it was a big issue people got very upset\nover it  the topic of abductions probably more so yes it had been known that there were probably isolated cases of what\nappeared to be abductions by aliens everyone knew about the barney\nand betty hill case of 1961 and a few others but the idea back then\nwas well do not be\nin the wrong place at the wrong time because if they see you they\nmay just take you what\nhappened during the eighties was a completely different understanding\nof that phenomenon people like budd hopkins foremost among them argued no no that is\nnot how it is at all this phenomenon appears to be very widespread based on my investigations and seems even to run in families people\nare repeatedly experiencing this phenomenon in\nother words a kind of way of looking at it that again met a\ntremendous amount of resistance at the time the\nmutilation controversy really reared itself in a significant way\nduring this period again there had been some cases of \u2018mutes in the sixties but they did not get a lot of attention until\nthe mid \u201970s and they have continued mutilation cases are\ndisturbing fascinating crop\ncircles not so disturbing but equally fascinating came up as a\nmajor topic during this period of time the\nother thing to say about the research is the effect of the internet\non research we all know how the internet has changed the world and\nit certainly has it also changed ufology what it really did is \nstarting around 1987  it just caused ufology to explode that is\nbasically what happened prior\nto 1987 if you were an interested researcher in that topic your\nvenues for expressing your ideas were very limited basically there\nwere some journals that were out there with a limited distribution you could try to create your own journal which some people did and\nhave an even more limited distribution all the journals had their\nown editorial policies for submission of course you had to be\ncareful what you wrote and that was about it starting\nin 1986 and 1987 we get the very beginnings of what we now would\ncall the internet back then there was no world wide web but there\nwere newsgroups bulletin boards and in fact the earliest\nnon-computer-programming bulletin board was dedicated to ufos the\nufo topic is one of the true pioneers of the internet and by 1987 it allowed people in this field to publish their thoughts without\nhaving to worry who was going to edit them \u2013 it just went out\nthere and suddenly they were getting more readers than those people\nwho\u2019d submitted their articles to the mufon\nufo journal suddenly\nthe old guard of ufology lost control over this domain you could say\nthat is a good thing you could say that is a bad thing but that is what happened for better and for worse in fact because after that a flood of information then came out and again a fascinating story so that is the story of the research and the conclusions of the\nbook let us just say roughly speaking the\nphenomenon is undeniable the cover-up is undeniable there is\na confrontational nature to this phenomenon there are many of them militaries around the world have been chasing these things not just\nthe american military now that does not mean that we are\nthe bad guys or that we are the good guys \u2013 that is a\ndifferent issue what it does mean though is that there is some\ntrouble in paradise someone\u2019s not getting along with someone\nelse  that we can say abductions in my assessment of this there is no question there is an abduction\nphenomenon  and it is not as has been argued by some people mostly notably dr steven greer  simply a military phenomenon in\nfact i think it is irresponsible to make this argument there\nis something yes you can clap for that applause\ncontinues]\n\n\nit\nboggles my mind to be perfectly candid here that a researcher can\nmake such a blanket statement you have a phenomenon that is\ngone on globally for a long time you have individuals that are\ndescribing highly consistent things in terms of their abduction\nexperiences and i do not know what else it can be other than a\nkind of religious-like zeal that can cause a person blindly to say\nthe only abductions that occur are military this i find\nindefensible and i think that a careful review of the evidence\ncertainly leads to that conclusion another\nconclusion that i draw in this book is the runaway nature of the\nblack budget and in a sense what i have come to call a\nbreakaway civilization what do i mean by that let me explain in\nthe course of human history we have had multiple civilizations\ncoexisting at the same time go back a thousand years \u2013 the\ncivilization of china was very different from the civilization of the\nnear east or of europe or of north or south america over\nthe course of the last millennia of course these civilizations have\nincreasingly come to merge and to interact with each other in a\nsense the story of our civilization is the coming together of these\nvarious cultures and civilizations and yet we have this history of\nseparate coexisting civilizations so it is really not a new\nconcept even\nduring the cold war certainly the scientific infrastructures of the\nunited states and the soviet union did not share their\ninformation with each other all that much right the soviets had\nthis belief in the theories of a fellow named trofim\nlysenko  utterly\nabsurd biological theories but the soviet scientists held to this as\na part of state dogma through the sixties so my point here is that\nwe have examples of separate scientific infrastructures what\ni am suggesting in this book is that what we call the black\nworld \u2013 existing as\nit does with essentially an infinite amount of money to play with for all intents and purposes and an incredible amount of secrecy\nwithin which to perform what they do  really no oversight  what\nwould actually happen if after as is inevitably the case a couple\nof brilliant genius black world scientists stumbled across a new\nscientific reality based on these technologies that they are\nlooking over they come up with some really super-nifty ideas would\nthey share it with the rest of us we have this idea that there is\na spin-off technology involved but is it necessarily so and\nwhat happens \u2013 as always is the case with science where one\nbreakthrough leads to another one which leads to yet another one \u2013\nthe next thing before you know it they are up here and the\nrest of us are down here and that gap may in fact continue to\nincrease to the point where they have the ability to do things that\nwe would consider absolutely impossible they\nwould be so different that with justice we can call them a separate or what i call breakaway\ncivilization with a completely different understanding of certain\nscientific principles and certainly a different world view because\nvery likely as i believe they are interacting in a much more\nup-close and personal way with \u201cthem than we\nare so they have a different set of principles by which they live\ntheir lives you\nhave to wonder how would they even be able to talk to us easily about\nwhat they know just as if we were to be time travelers going back a\nthousand years how would we talk to people of any society of a\nthousand years ago how would be able to tell them the things that we\nknow it might be difficult i\nthink that is something that we need to consider that is\nalready happened i will\ndo a little quick glimpse into my forthcoming book volume 3 which i\nhave tentatively subtitled the\nfight for disclosure and\nit will cover the year 1992 to the present really nearly all of my research for that is done it is one reason it\ntook this book so long is i ended up doing research for volumes 2\nand 3 all at once so i think it will be a lot less time for me to do\nthis book these\nare just off the top of my head on the plane flying here my\nthoughts on how this book is going to come together the internet\nrevolution obviously i do not think it needs to be again\nsaid here what also happened in the nineties is an explosion of\nreported ufo sightings it is incredible go\nto the national ufo reporting center on the web run by peter\ndavenport and you will find  he catalogs about 5,000 ufo\nsightings each year now most of these do not get investigated clearly they are what you had call raw reports but they are\npretty interesting i myself investigated two cases out of that database and i came away\nfeeling that both of those were legitimate i am not saying all\nof these cases are legitimate but i think a lot of them probably\nare the\nfact is that in our own age it is easier and easier now to\nreport this there is no official government body that you can\nreport this to which is a failure of our republic \u2013 very much\nso \u2013 because frankly if you encounter what is the most\namazing thing you have ever seen in your life one would think\nthere should be an agency in your government that is charged with\ndealing with it that is\nwhy the government is supposed to be responsive to you right and\nyet there is not any but yet there are places on the web and\nit is easier and easier to report it so there is an\nenormous amount there there\nhas been the release not just of some legitimate documents really the glory age of freedom of information i think was in the late\n\u201970s but what we have had since then are continued\nreleases of official documents but also the release of a lot of\ndisputed documents these are the so-called majestic\ndocuments \u2013 you can read all of them at the website of\nryan and bob wood [ www.majesticdocuments.com i\nthink that a very good case can be made for the authenticity of many\nof those documents but the point is that they are disputed what that means is they are of unknown provenance and again it\nserves to muddy the waters of this field i think it is\nimportant that we continue to try to do research on those documents\nto try to authenticate them or not there\nhave been a lot of initiatives in the nineties and in our own century\ntoward disclosure i will deal with the rockefeller initiative the whole roswell gao \u2013 general accounting office \u2013\nfiasco of the early \u201990s under\nthe clinton years the\nefforts of dr steven greer in the nineties leading up to his press\nconference in 2001 are very important the efforts of my friend stephen basset i think figure into this equation the sci-fi john\npodesta event of a\ncouple of years ago \u2013 all of these are important in\nother words what i think we are seeing is very much an increase\nin the attempts now for citizen groups publicly to grab this issue\nand make major statements about the need to end the cover-up \u2013\nmuch much greater than had ever happened in the past much much\nmore so there is\nalso a very significant part \u2013 and this conference is obviously\na very strong reflection of this \u2013 is the growth of what we\nmight call higher\nconsciousnesses attitudes\nwithin the ufo community back in the eighties and seventies there\nwas a little bit of this if you go back further to the fifties certainly what we could call the contactees\nwould be considered sort of \u201cnew agey for their time without a doubt but\nreally i think this is a different order of magnitude what we have\nbeen experiencing through the nineties l think it is probably\nconnected with greater communication through avenues like the\ninternet certainly it is an important part of what is\ngoing on and it is something that i will need to deal with\nin an appropriate way in my book the\nother big thing geopolitically is the death of the nation-state the new world order okay this is probably the greatest\nunremarked-upon  at least in the mainstream  event of our\nlifetimes at least geopolitically nations i do not even know\nwhat a nation is anymore do they even exist if groups of people\n living with the same language in an area is that a nation who is\nsovereign are you sovereign are we sovereign in our country well we are in theory and we must continue to fight for this in reality our world has become something very different and this has got to be\npart of any study of the ufo realities in the last 20 years because again we have to understand the true nature of the structure of\npower a\nnew exopolitics well maybe that is an overly-dramatic statement look any time we are\ngoing to talk about exopolitics \u2013 that is the relationship of\nus and them  well those are the two variables us\nand them and we have to have a clear understanding of both of these variables\nto be able to talk intelligently about what we will call exopolitics it is got to be done so through all of this as well it is essential \u2013 absolutely\nessential \u2013 that we ask ourselves how\ndo we know what we know what is our source of data and who are we\nsaying this to what\ni mean here is that if we are going to be talking about other\nentities in the galactic civilization we had better damn-well\nback up what we say with something other than i\ngot this through a remote-viewed bit of information or through direct\ncontact with an alien being i am\nvery sorry that is not enough it may be enough in a private\nconversation with other researchers if that is what you\nbelieve everyone\u2019s entitled to have their beliefs i speculate all the\ntime but we do ourselves a disservice as a community when we go\nfast and loose with this kind of thing we have got to be more\ndisciplined with how we speak to the world how\nwould it be if when you get an opportunity to say what we are\nbelieving to a larger media organization we go just off with this\nand look ridiculous we are not in a position where we really\ncan afford to do that we have to be more careful we\ncan speculate but we must distinguish between what we know\nand what we believe they are not the same it is not hard to do \u2013 it just\nmeans qualifying one\u2019s statements a little bit okay i do not\nthink that is asking too much let us\nlook at us\na little bit let us understand who we are what we have had\nis a situation where we have been retrieving exotic technologies now there is a big statement by me i grant it is something\nthat i believe i back up sufficiently in my book there has been a\ngreat deal of information on this everyone knows about the roswell\ncase and there have been many others frankly these\ntechnologies \u2013 this is my hypothesis here okay have\nto be kept secret you have\ngot a cold war going on back in those days \u2013 we\ncannot let the russians see what we have got \u2013\nrequiring secret\nbudgetary appropriations i.e the creation of a black budget the\nufo phenomenon is almost certainly the key factor in the creation of\nthe black budget world that we have today not the only one but one\nof the key motivators i think privatization i am just going to have to run through this runaway\ntechnological achievements this\nis our secret infrastructure that is part of us okay when most of us \u2013 i am excluding the present company here\n\u2013 but i think most people go through our lives with the\nassumption that we get our sources of information from like the\nmedia and that would include tv but also internet we\nhave a political system we have an academic community in which there\nis a back-and-forth kind of exchange there so that they also are\nresponsive to us in theory the media of course we are told well they give the public\nwhat the public wants and\nthe academic world of course is supposed to be responsive to the\ninherent value of truth and there is a back and forth there the\npolitical system\u2019s supposed to be responsive to us throw\nthe bums out and so\nforth how\nis it really well this is how i think things have actually shaped\nup the arrow\u2019s going one way here referring to overhead\npicture] it is going at you and it is not just media and the politics and the academics there is a corporate\nsystem in place this is\nsomething that exopolitical analysis does not fully get it is\ngreat to talk about personal transformation but we live in a world\nof corporations and they do not give a crap about personal\ntransformation they are driven by profit and shareholder value that is all they care about they can be driven by beautiful\npeople who really do care about the world but if they are not\nincreasing shareholder value they are gone corporations\nhave an iron law in which they must\nincrease shareholder value that is their raison\nd\u2019etre if they are not doing that then the ceo is gone which means\nthat they must behave in certain ways and those certain ways unfortunately are not typically designed to increase higher\nconsciousness among the people they are instead designed to take\nmoney out of your bank account that is what they do that is\nour world and there is a great deal of interaction between\nthose major worlds and there is other branches i probably could\nhave thought of if i had more time under\na rubric though of an elite\n\u2013 yes there is an elite i do not know what to call them\nanymore i used to call them the national security state well they are not quite national they are\na little bit more than that are not they international\nfinancial maximum security state toss in entertainment state ed\ncomment the \u201celite are the supranational\nsovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers this term was coined by david rockefeller in 1991 when he thanked a\ngathering of the bilderberg attendees for their dedicated efforts to\nconceal and cover up the truth of who the elite really are if\nyou looked at america as a room of 100 people okay and if there is\n$100 in the room \u2013 assuming the dollar\u2019s still worth\nsomething when we do this \u2013 one of those guys would own $40 to\n$45 of those dollars that is america that is the world really and then another guy would have another $11 bucks and then\nthe last 80 people would have really nothing so that is the room that has a political system it is got a\nmedia it is got all these things that make it go it is\nnot hard really to figure out who is going to be in the best\nposition to manipulate all of these things for his own benefit obviously it is the guy with the $40 45 bucks that is\nour world it is not complicated and yet of course it is\nnever analyzed in this way in our mainstream media precisely because\nthey are owned by that guy with the $45 bucks so we\nhave to disabuse ourselves of the notion that we have a truly open\nprocess in any way we do not it is not and\nthis matters when we talk about ufo disclosure because does not\nit matter if you get disclosure from your government what the\nnature of that government is if it is a republican system [i.e constitutional republic] that is responsive to you that\u2018s one\nthing but what if it is a proto-crypto-post-modern fascist\nstate instead well guess what it is we are not moving toward democracy and by\nthe way as i said earlier today i do not think democracy is\nbad what i think is uninformed citizens of a democracy is a very very dangerous thing are\nwe moving toward a world of slaves and slave owners yes we are that is the direction escape into your own little private\nidaho where you can play your video games and watch tv and zone out it is a lot more fun frankly than dealing with all the stuff\nwe have to deal with if your house is on fire but you are\nhaving a really wicked-cool dream who wants to wake up  and\ndeal with the crisis what\nis our world moving toward we have decoded the human genome we are making amazing strides right now in the world of\nnanotechnology what will be called quantum computing artificial\nintelligence creation of a super race maybe getting rid of\nredundant people like us there is that word you hear that\nword a lot these days redundant is not that scary it scares me people are not redundant so we are in a post-modern dystopia we are depleting our\nresources  we all know this threatened cascading failure of the\nglobal ecosystem  failing global infrastructures is there an\nendgame scenario being discussed by those people in the know are\nthey planning something other people have discussed this earlier i am going to let you just ponder that one yourself now\nlet us look at them who are they how can we learn about them this should always be at\nthe forefront of our thinking well we can learn a little bit about them through reviewing some of the\nufo sighting literature there are many cases of people who have\ndescribed i mean seemingly honest very very low-key people have\nsaid yes i had an\nencounter with a being that i do not think they were human there is a lot of that and we can learn a lot from that abduction\nliterature yes also but let us be careful and the only\nreason i say that is because when people are taken or seem to be\ntaken it is not under the best of circumstances and there\ncertainly seems to be a lot of manipulation going on there experiencers remote viewers yes but we have to be very careful let us not be\nirresponsible i will leave it at that because i am running\nshort who\nare they here\u2019re a few factors about them they operate by\nstealth at least usually they do not seem to be that\ninterested in letting us deal with them in an open public way i\nthink personally that there is more than one group involved with diverse agendas probably according\nto abduction and other kinds of research they are highly\ntelepathic they have an ability to manipulate human thinking human\nemotions as do in fact a lot of current military covert\ntechnologies they\nappear to have some mastery over space-time they do not seem to\nhave the kinds of emotional responses that we do at least not most\nof the time do they look like us i think some would suggest well maybe they do it would be logical if i were an alien here on earth if i wanted to deal with the native species i would probably enhance\nor manipulate my own native humans and have them do work from me where\nare they from are they from another planet are they from another\ntime are they from another dimension i do not know i do not\nknow do not know are\nthey truthful or not ah okay again let us pretend that we are\ntime travelers you go back a thousand years you talk to the most\nintelligent person in the world a thousand years ago let us\nsay i do not know some monk in an abbey who happens to be a\ngenius you sit down with this person for a day and you try to\ndescribe our world how\nmany mental revolutions is that person going to be able to handle\nbefore they just say i\ncannot take it okay probably not too many tell them that the earth goes around the\nsun or that there are these little things called viruses or you\nknow all kinds of technological capabilities there is only a\ncertain amount that a person can handle if\nthey are coming here to deal with us i think it is\nreasonable to assume that they are not telling us everything either did\nthey create us did they manipulate us did they enhance us if so do they see us as their investment do they see us as their property how long has this been going on there\u2019re\nfallacies involved here here\u2019s a fallacy if\nthey are so technologically advanced they must have solved\ntheir major social economic and political problems you\nhear this a lot i hear it a lot i do not buy it at all again we go back in time let us say all of us go back with our\nipods and our cell phones and maybe a couple of laptops it does not\nmatter where we go we meet some people of a thousand years ago and\nthey look at this laptop and they are like whoa man that is cool for you to have gotten to this level you\nmust have solved all of your social economic and political\nproblems and\nthen right we would look at each other we had say well okay you take care oh and keep that on \u201csafety you know whatever okay they may not have either in fact when you really think about it if\nyou look at the species that we know of on earth it is only the\nhighest intellectual species \u2013 us \u2013 that has the ability\nto be sadistic that tortures maybe the higher up the ladder you go the greater the range from the angelic to the truly demonic and again maybe that is the case with them i do not know are\nthey ready to welcome us with open arms to the cosmos this is a\nstatement i admit this is what dr steven greer actually literally said at barcelona a couple of months ago i watched it on\nyoutube thinking w-h-a-a-t i am sorry i beg to differ i beg to differ there is\na disclosure paradox here it is\nimpossible it can never happen but it is inevitable let us\ntalk about some of the fallout of disclosure these are some and\ncertainly not all of the issues that a true disclosure\u2019s going\nto have to deal with why\nhave we been chasing them why is this confrontation going on how\nhave you been able to keep this secret mr president what does that\nsay about the structure of our secrecy oh that is going to be a lot of fun to talk about what\nare all these secret programs about is there a secret space program that might a tough one for the president or any other responsible\nagency to discuss yeah we actually are going off-world people and we have been going\nto mars and the moon for \u201cx number of years you\nknow a lot of people might be a little upset about that having paid\nfor a program that they may not have known about and might have\nwanted some control over and\nthen dealing with who these other beings are may not be an easy\nissue understanding why they are interested in us there\nwill be challenges  i guarantee you  to the structures of power\nin this world politically finance industry all of these i will\nnot have time to go through these this was an expansion of what i\nwas just telling you i\nwill just pause here though their\ninterest in us why are\nthey interested in us well it is not that hard for me to see\nthis one this is an easy one a\nhundred years ago we had horses pulling carts that was our world one\nhundred years ago we are now at the verge of having your\ncomputer be as intelligent as you are this is the latest from ai\nexperts in ten years they say your computer will have the full\ncomputational power of one human brain that is a major\nmilestone and\nof course once they achieve that they are going to surpass\nthat you will wake up and you will chat with your computer your computer will sound like a person except well it will be a\nlittle bit smarter than us you know do a quadrillion number of\ncalculations per second or pull any data off the internet like that so a really good personal assistant let us\nhope they do not pull a terminator or matrix or an i robot\non us the\npoint that i am making is that we are about to reinvent our\nwhole civilization other intelligent species that are looking at\nthis must be able to know this they must be able to know that we are\nabout to leap into their world we have actually been in their\nworld all along we have only been asleep now it is time for us\nto wake up many many many disclosure problems \u2013 where do you want to start how do you undo a lie this big without angering so many people without threatening your own status think\nback just a little more than two decades ago to gorbachev and his\nglasnost\nwhich six years later ended the soviet union the spiral of reform\nbecame too much it just got out of his control you start talking\nabout openness and suddenly the baltic states say great we do not want to be in your country anymore remember how you took us\nover in 1940 oh yeah that right we are\ngone okay so what would happen after 60-plus years of the ufo secret would there\nbe a spiraling out of control it might start off real manageable it\nmight not end that way would there be vigilantes let us\nget the aliens you are an alien what\nif we got free energy everyone talks about free energy like it is\ngoing to be the greatest thing what if it is not we used to\nhave free energy \u2013 it was called oil oil i mean for all\nintents and purposes was free for a long time and we did things with\noil that really were not all that heartwarming to the earth now it is true that with free energy we might not have to hack down\nthe whole global ecosystem you might be able to heat your home\nforever for free i guess you might be able to make a really neat\nbomb too and blow up the pacific ocean with that same source of\nenergy if it is not tightly controlled i do not know there\u2019re\na lot of possibilities here the fire\nof prometheus can be good\nand bad and again i am not arguing that we should not\nmove ahead we have no choice history is bigger than we are read\ntolstoy he will prove it to you \u2013 history is bigger things are going to happen and we are going to get it it is\ngoing to happen but it may not be fun it may not be easy and\nin the short term all right if we discover through the secrets\nthat well there is a better version of petroleum we do not\nneed that \u2013 hey that is great steel pfff awesome we have got this nano-tektite whatever electronics well okay in the long run this is fabulous in the short run it will\nmean major financial disruptions how long will that last ten years more it will not be fun or it may\nnot be fun certainly not for those elites who may own those\nindustries but it may not be fun for us either it is going to be a bumpy\nride and nevertheless it will happen they cannot stop this you cannot stop history the pace of change is so rapid it is\nso revolutionary  it will not be stopped bill\njoy the co-founder of\nsun\nmicrosystems was very\nconcerned is concerned over the runaway nature of artificial\nintelligence and is afraid of a kind of terminator-like\nscenario or some other equally-bad thing that may happen and for a\nnumber of years has been calling to other executives to try to slow\ndown or even stop the development of advanced ai it is\nimpossible it is spitting into the wind you cannot win there\u2019re always going to be forces that will let us\ntweak this program here we will fix this software here it is going to happen and it is the same with disclosure we are\nin a very unstable period of our history it is like\neverything\u2019s bouncing around that is exactly my view of the\ntype of environment in which some monumental mistake will occur in\nwhich the secrets will come out in some way i do not know how i do not know what the trigger will be but it is going to\nhappen when i do not know either i predict within ten years now when it happens there is going to be attempts you know this to control the spin okay it is going to happen and so it is going to be our\njob the job of any responsible researcher \u2013 and your job  to\nensure that that does not happen we have\ngot to make sure that the actual truth comes out even if it is\nhorrible even if it is horrible \u2013 especially\nif it is horrible there is no other way we are going\nto be able to deal with the reality until we learn the full import\nof what is going on at\nthe bottom here i see not one enemy but maybe two maybe several by that i mean the enemy is not just the national security\nstate which has been hiding this information from us for all these\nyears they are\na problem to deal with but there may be some extraterrestrial or interdimensional or non-human\nintelligences that may not be working toward our best interests if\nwe do not acknowledge that at least as a distinct possibility i think we are fools we\nhave to even if their intentions may not be bad what happens to\nindigenous cultures when they encounter a\nhighly-technically-proficient society we know it may be in the long\nrun  things get better for them i do not know you can\ndecide that for yourself but the point is that we have to be\nvigilant against a variety of fronts here hope\nand fear fear is an\nenemy we know this\nbecause when we are afraid we react irrationally to things we do not\nthink through hope is an enemy too though that sounds kind of\nwrong does not it everyone likes to have hope do not\ngive up hope but here\u2019s\nthe problem with hope hope\nalso deludes we\nneed to have a cold eye we have to be able to look at reality in as\nalert and awake a fashion as we can this is why i love the title of\nthis conference awake and\naware that is exactly\nright what\nis true higher consciousness well it starts with awareness with\nseeing things as they are not as you want them to be not as you\nhope they can be \u2013 you have to see them as they are it is only\nthrough going over that first large hurdle i feel that we can\nreally attain a true higher consciousness a true awareness in which\nwe are awake not asleep kerry\noften writes in her emails awaken\nthe dreamer i think that\nis exactly the attitude that we all must have we have been in a\ndream state and we have to wake up that is\neverything thank you very much if\nyou have any questions you can go to my website wow thank you thank you very very much i\njust want to say that i have unfortunately a limited number of\nbooks here i will be at my table in the back right outside there and if you are interested in the new book i have it i will be\nglad to sign it for you if i run out they are easily available\non my website or through amazon.com thanks\nvery much richard thank you thank you so much thank you applause\ncontinues]\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nkerry\ncassidy (kc we are very honored to have alex collier join us this is pretty much unprecedented he does not speak as you may\nknow often or even has in quite some time so\ni just wanted to say that i got a message over a year ago that the\nandromedans wished to speak and that they wished alex collier to come\nto camelot and that we could provide a service or a platform for\nthat so we have been working to have that happen it is\ntaken quite some time we are\nreally happy that this can happen today and we just want to say thank\nyou very much for making this possible to the hidden beings here and\naround us at this time so alex i am actually not going to give you a big introduction\nbeyond that today i am going to let you speak for yourself ladies\nand gentlemen alex collier alex\ncollier (ac can you all hear all right great i want to thank\nall the speakers i was at home yesterday watching the streaming and\ngod they were just you know george green and just all of the\nspeakers \u2013 just fantastic they give so much i\nknow that all of you here give so much and you try in your own way to\nshare the light i mean there is two ways to be the light \u2013\none is to be the candle and the other is the mirror that reflects the\ncandle we\nlive in an extraordinary time on earth i mean absolutely\nextraordinary in the next several years you are all going to\nthink you are living in a science fiction movie you are living\nin a science fiction movie except it is not a movie it is\nreality if\nyou want information on me i think there is some on the web both pro and con i am\njust going to get right into it i am going to give you some\nupdates and then we are going to talk about some things that i\nwas specifically asked to speak to you about from morenae einstein\nsaid you cannot solve the\nproblems of the world with the same thinking that created them and that is no more relevant than it is today we have enormous\nproblems or challenges \u2013 i should say challenges\n\u2013 that take enormous amounts of brainstorming and solutions the\ndifficulty in trying to solve some of the issues that we have is the\nfact that we do not have all the data the two gentlemen that were up\nhere prior to alluded to that so did robert dean mr green bill\nand kerry have so many of the speakers as we keep trying to go\nforth and gather all the information to try to solve this out i like many of the other speakers and each of you have a small piece\nof the puzzle now we are going to talk about some of that\ntoday i\nknow that there is an awful lot of talk about disclosure i know\nthat in the exopolitics community there is a great deal of talk\nabout disclosure i\npersonally do not believe the united states government\u2019s\never going to admit it it will probably come from another\ncountry india or china first or the extraterrestrials themselves\nare going to show themselves and just say hey this charade\u2019s gone on long enough which is probably the highest probability at this point we will talk\nabout some of that today i\nhad honed my presentation for an hour because that is what i\nthought i had so in talking about solving the problems at the very\ntop of our power structure the planet earth lives in a pyramidal\npower structure extraterrestrial\ncivilizations no longer use that power structure \u2013 the\npyramidal power structure they have been using a holographic ever\nsince the end of the orion wars  which would be in our linear time\nabout 360,000 years ago since\nthen most of the civilized benevolent civilizations including some\nof the rogue regressive groups \u2013 and they are a minority \u2013\nhave been using a holographic social structure and we are going\nto talk about that today we are\nalso going to talk about creating a new domain\nof knowing a space in\nwhich we can create an opportunity for earth to be mentored because\nwe need some help here we are a little bit in over our heads so it takes me a little while to warm up here i am a little rusty as\nof the last several days much of the cassini project has been\nclassified the reason for that is because of all the mother ship\nactivity that has now been filmed and documented in the saturnian\nsystem around saturn we\nalso have a million-and-a-half miles off of the south pole a\n20-mile craft that has sat and is stationary nasa and other\norganizations telescopes have been monitoring it for eight\nmonths they watch its trajectory to us it is now stationary and\nthere are craft going in and out of this 20-mile structure i do not\nknow any more about it than that i\nalso want you to know that there is a very large planetary structure\ncoming in 18 degrees right ascension of neptune\u2019s orbit it\nshould be visible sometime in the next year there\nis an awful lot going on and of course you are all paying the\nbills and no one\u2019s being told anything about it now it goes far deeper than spooking\nthe herd that is really\nnot the intention here at all the\nintention here and what is really been going on is simply\nthis bob dean made a reference yesterday to almost feeling sorry for\nthe government about the situation that they are in i would\nhave to concur with him on that in the fact that the government made\nsome treaties cut some deals for technology in exchange for\nexperimentation and observation and they were tricked they\nreally did not know what they were getting themselves into and now\nthe hand has been dealt there\nare many people within the ufo community that say that all the\nextraterrestrials are benevolent ladies and gentlemen it is in my\nown personal opinion and based on the knowledge that i have that\nthat is completely irresponsible to say we\nlive in a duality because if it was all love and light we would not\nbe going down this road to global fascism and the powers that be\nwanting to eliminate two-thirds of the world\u2019s population that\nis not love and light so we have a lot of things to cover and a lot of things are going to be\noccurring the\neconomic situation is what it is mr green gave a fantastic\npresentation yesterday there is absolutely nothing that i disagree\nwith him about he made a reference to buying gold and silver i\nthink that is a really good idea however you cannot eat gold\nand silver it\nis imperative that you start storing food and i will tell you simply\nwhy if they do crash the dollar which they are going to do in order\nto create a global currency and a global government you will not\nbe able to buy food he made reference to the currency being devalued\nsix-to-one in the next several months gasoline will go to $18 20 a\ngallon truckers will not be able to deliver products what you have\nis what you will have it\nis imperative to if you can start forming within your community community gardens figuring it out you need to start talking about\nthis i\nknow most people are simply not open to it just do the best you can i mean we are all fighting the fight now america is on the front line of this and the reason is simple america created a new domain\nof knowing america was\ncreated to get rid of the aristocracy of the old world to create\nsomething new to create individual liberties to create personal\nfreedoms that was never known in the world before we\nhave that and because of our apathy we have lost virtually all of\nthose it is no one else\u2019s fault it is our own fault we\nhave known since the sixties that the cia has been trafficking\nnarcotics we know this we have known that the cia has been\nassassinating and overthrowing governments we\nhave known that there is been a cover-up of what there is on the\nmoon and inside our solar system we know this we know that there is\nextraterrestrial life we know this that is no longer the\ndiscussion we know that the government has become corrupt the\npeople \u2013 the personages \u2013 that rule the planet are not\nus they are not human beings and i will say this with my very last breath they are not us now what happened was that they took over because they think\nholographically it was very easy to get around the pyramidal power\nstructure on earth because it is completely obsolete everywhere\nelse out there so if you come in using a holograph using holographic thinking what\nyou do is you create your structure everywhere so no matter what\nhappens whether one group gets taken out another group gets taken\nout is gone  the other components are still there to rise up and\nstill manage and control because each of these components have a\npicture of the whole they\nhave all the technology and everything they need to continue to\ncontrol and dominate and brainwash we are over our heads here but we are not alone now what happened was they took over it was very easy to take over the\ngovernments you dangle technology you dangle knowledge you dangle\nancient history and you give them this technology in\nsecret you\nhave it we are going to give it to you the united states of america made this mistake so bob dean again mr dean made a reference yesterday to the missing\ntrillions of dollars from the federal reserve i have been told it is\n$24 trillion dollars is what they carry on their books and\nvirtually most of that has gone into the secret space program and the\ncolonization of our solar system you\ncan choose to believe that or not it does not matter and it\ndoes not change the reality of it so what happened was the pirates took over the ship the governments realizing that they had all this technology and that they were a\nthousand years more advanced than we were instead of telling\neveryone hey we have a\nproblem here and\nstanding tall and doing the right thing they joined the pirates we\nare literally only now as passengers on the ship finding out and\nrealizing that we have been hijacked that is the movement and many people are going to have a very difficult time when they\nrealize that reality is not at all what they think it is or what they\nthought it was even those of us who have been exposed to this for\nmany many years have \u201coh\nshit moments it is impossible not to you know yes our politicians sold out it was easy to corrupt them we\nhave an enormous mess they are stuck in the middle as well over\nthe next year year and a half there\u2019re going to be so many\nchanges america\nis the focal point here of this and the reason for that is because\namericans despite our educational system are still very smart we\nare very able to think out of the box we are excellent\nproblem-solvers and we are armed to the teeth they constantly will\nhave to be looking over their shoulder unless they take us out ladies\nand gentlemen that is the goal they cannot have a world\ngovernment without taking out the u.s and i mean taking it\nto its knees now this is not where the whole presentation is going but it is\nimportant to give you this background because the world used to look\nto us for the ideals of freedom immigrants all over the world have\ncome to america my grandparents were immigrants to this country because they believed in individual liberties they believed in\nfreedom they believed in the principles that were in the\nconstitution the declaration of independence and the bill of\nrights ladies\nand gentlemen that\nis who we are we are not the crap that they show you on television gentlemen you are not the weak-kneed sissy morons they try to portray us on\ntelevision either you are strong you are family-oriented you have\nfaith and you are warriors and you are going to need to take a\nstand and defend your country and your family make no mistake about\nit the\ntwo gentlemen that were here talking about the super soldiers yeah they are here they are definitely here they are\nhybrids they are here and there is more that is been\ngoing on i\nwas hoping that one of them would talk about what happened in dulce new mexico but they did not and i do not necessarily want to\ngo there either because oh god it is sick it is\nsick now\ni there is other things to cover but i bring it up because\nmany people that have the knowledge that have been in black ops special ops that have been involved in the et component know about\nthat small rogue group \u2013 and they are not gone yet some\nof them are still here all right and they still create and wreak\nhavoc i\nalso want to tell you \u2013 and i have been asked to share this\nwith you \u2013 about the vaccine the new swine flu vaccine morenae\nhas told me to tell you or everyone that this vaccine will\npermanently damage your dna so whatever else comes out of that it\nwill permanently damage your dna now many of us in the community and in the world as a whole we cannot\neven agree on what the problem is and because of that we will never\neven agree on a solution so it is imperative that open dialogue\ncontinue to occur i\nknow that for those who have been in the exopolitics \u2013 that is\nwhat i am basically calling the ufo community exopolitics now \u2013 you have had a remarkable amount of patience and your\nbiggest tests are coming because as more and more of this\ninformation comes out more and more people are going to want to ask\nyou who they thought were crazy what\nthe hell\u2019s going on they are\ngoing to want to know and you are going to have to try in a\nvery calm manner explain it to them even though you yourselves are\ngoing to have all the butterflies \u2013 you are going to be\nwondering how the hell am\ni even going to deal with this because you have some background information now this et component is really about us it is our destiny to travel the\nstars it is our destiny to continue to move out and colonize space especially our own solar system it is not our destiny to be killed\nby vaccines and war you\nwill have to make those choices my choices are already made my\ndecisions are clear i am the father of five children there is no\nway i am going to back down and i am going to sell them\ninto slavery never going to happen okay you need to\nmake your own choices okay i once asked vissaeus one of the andromedans who has since crossed over what was to become\nof us some of this may be a review for some of you what was to\nbecome of us what was going to happen to our race to our\ncivilization he\njust looked at me and he said this\nis how we see you responsible freedom of self-determination becoming truly self-confident and free to unconditionally be\nresponsible for oneself without being coerced\nto accept some higher authority in\nour galaxy the more advanced the civilizations have become in\nthe center of the galaxy the riffraff had to start moving out to the\noutskirts of the galaxy the riffraff \u2013 just like star\nwars okay we are in the\nboonies and that is why we have some riffraff here we are\nnot the only planetary race that is having problems with the\nriffraff but\nwhat is unique about us is that genetically we are considered\n to the andromedan race \u2013  genetic royalty i\nhave been saying this since day one we\nare extremely unique and\nit is because of that uniqueness we have enormous strength we\nhave enormous capacity for emotions we have enormous intent and\ndrive to not only survive but to create what we lack is faith in\nourselves at\nthe end of world war ii well let me put it another way the nazis\ndid not lose the war okay germany lost the war but the nazis\nwere brought here and to russia now the mind technology the mind control the space technology the\nreverse engineering the technology that they had been given prior to\nthe war by a small group of extraterrestrials from the star system of\naldebaran was brought here and honed and polished and combined with other\ntechnology that the zeta\ntwos the dows [ed note spelling of \u201cdows is uncertain googled and found nothing what many\nfolks know as the grays \u2013 all those began to compliment\neach other remarkable technology technology\nwe absolutely need here i mean the combustion engine has been\nobsolete for 70 years i understand that india also is now going to\nexperiment on wireless electricity hell tesla did that in 1902 in\ncolorado springs we know it works okay but those that were funding\nhis experiment asked him where is\nthe meter and he says well there is none it is\nfree they shut it down the\nquestion is well we will get to that i am sorry i am\njumping around here the\nreality is ladies and gentlemen what kind of country do you want to\nlive in what kind of world do you want to live in clearly what\nwe are doing now does not work \u2013 it has run its\ncourse we\nhave a government that has a lot of problems we have corruption\nwithin it not all of it but we clearly have corruption within it they have sold out and have been totally compromised they themselves\ndo not know what to do and their only solution is to turn the\npower of the military and the power of the pharmaceutical companies\nagainst the american people that is their solution that\nis not okay that is not okay it is\ntime for the ufo the exopolitics community to start creating\nanother domain of knowing and that domain of knowing is two things what\ndoes a holographic social structure look like how can we live with a\nholographic social structure mirrored after some of the principles\nthat our founding fathers laid but it was not perfect what\ncould we do now and we are not just talking about the united\nstates this has to be a global thing this has to be a global\nmovement what does that look like so\nwe need to create and start groups dialogues talking about living\nin a holographic structure where all the information that is\navailable \u2013 black op secret top secret above top secret \u2013\nis available to everyone we\ncould just start with the information that we do have the rest of it\nwill come it is going to collapse on itself because it is\nno good it cannot stand on its own the minute we turn our focus\naway from them and they cannot feed off our fear it will\ncollapse in a heartbeat because where focus goes energy flows as\nlong as they keep you looking at it they are using the energy of\nyour soul of your spirit to feed this monstrosity it is time\nto just ignore them turn your focus away and let us create what\nwe really really want \u2013 but we have to decide what that is along\nwith that i have been asked to start asking people to talk to people\n\u2013 you are the first to hear this \u2013 about what would\nit look like for you for earth and we will start with the\nexopolitics community what would it look like for you to be mentored\nby several benevolent extraterrestrial races what would that look\nlike what\nwould we need to do to establish not only that communication but at\nthe same time have us feel safe with checks and balances so that\nthey could walk their talk and we have to walk our talk open\nmentorship is our destiny it is going to happen anyway but we\ncannot wait for the government to turn itself around it cannot\nbecause it is not in control right it is not in control so we have to turn our focus away from all that drama and figure out\nanother way what\ni want to do now is read to you what i was given way-back-when\nregarding creating a domain\nof knowing this also\ncame from vissaeus create\nanother domain of knowing communicating and being in other words the domain of calling forth or generating your intent needs to be\nmore distinct your\nphysics as you call it is a good example of this calling-forth there have been men on your planet who have called forth new domains\nof thinking that never existed before here they\ninvented it they did not fantasize it they did not\npretend they literally created this new context from what you now\ncall physics your\nhumanity is strong with this kind of example no being however makes the distinction that this is what they are i\nwould like to give you an example your concept of human rights it\nwas not so long ago that no such thing existed on your planet it just simply did not exist you terrans did not have any\nrights only the kings and the priests had their rights but most of\nyou terrans do not have any rights so you and other terrans created\nhuman rights from nothing you\ncreated the domain that created not only the rights to come forth you created the language and then you communicated it and this\ncommunication that you gave had power because it was full of intent it has the power not only to represent and to invoke but also to\nliterally bring it into being this\nis what your races need to do in order to clearly know yourselves now in talking about that let us talk about religions for a moment the pyramidal structure of our governments primarily have come out of\nancient rome and rome was essentially controlled by 13 families those 13 families still exist today many\nof the world\u2019s religions though they have had a tremendous\namount of value and have brought an enormous amount of comfort to\nmany people in our history and in our present day they focus on\nshame guilt sin and control ladies\nand gentlemen that is the trap they do not focus on\nself-responsibility they do not focus on life or respect they in fact create more division than we have ever known now did they start out that way with the exception of the roman catholic\nchurch \u2013 i am just going to be blunt about it \u2013 no but the powers that be are masters of infiltrating movements what\nthey do and i will give you the best example i can give you is\nthat of a charitable foundation a\nfoundation is created using the power of the people and the monies the resources of the people to do something that is of a benefit to\nhumanity as it is moving and it begins to gain power and it\nstarts to spread and shift consciousness awareness the powers that\nbe will walk in and say hey we really believe in what you are doing and we are going to\ngive you a 25-million-dollar grant to help you continue to do your\nwork but we want to put one of our members on the board just to\nmake sure that the money is spent wisely then\nthey do it again and now you have a second board member and now you\nhave a third board member and before you know it that movement that foundation instead of going up and creating more consciousness more awareness is now heading the other way now they also control\nthe wealth of that foundation we\nhave been thinking in a pyramidal structure and a third density\nstructure they are in fourth density and holographic we have\nto think the same way and we have to be talking about how\nis it that we got ourselves into this it is\nessential that we put blame to the side for the moment there is\nplenty of that and there will be plenty of that what\nwe need is the knowledge we need to know how these structures work so that we can create something different something in total\nopposition to it because i cannot imagine everybody\u2019s\nhappy with the way things are and\nthis is not just about the united states this is about the\nglobal population because the extraterrestrial races do not see\nus as separate countries they see us as one race and we are\nall between a rock and a hard place pretty much \u2013 at the\nmoment taking\npersonal responsibility is huge but it really is the first and the biggest step to achieving full\nconsciousness i am\ngoing to read you a quote that i found it is from a gentleman\nnamed little hawk he is a native american indian with the\nmohawk tribe take credit\nfor your mistakes not what you do good  because you are\nsupposed to be doing good anyway we have\nall made mistakes we have all screwed up but that is part\nof the learning process if you had all knowledge and you were\nall-seeing you would not need to be here so collectively and\nindividually we need to start looking at the world and saying what\nhas my contribution been now i am not talking about going out and trying to save the world it is not about that at all it is really about each one of\nus individually it is about being the light it is about\nnot feeling shame for our mistakes it is about absolutely\nlearning that you are not a sinner that is such crap that i want to\nvomit every time i hear that you\nare not a sinner you are a spiritual being in a physical body or as george green\nsaid rent-a-wreck i liked that that was really cute okay now look at the structure that is overlaying us governments of control\nand dominance a monetary system that controls everything corporations and banks that own the debt of every nation which means\nliterally they are in control because they have the debt we\nhave medical and pharmaceutical companies who have had cures for\ncancer and other diseases that now want to damage your dna with\nuntested vaccinations imagine\nhow afraid they are of you can you just for a moment imagine how\nafraid of you they are and now you have got to ask yourself the\nquestion why are they\nafraid of you because\nwe are awesome awesome creator-gods we have the ability to create\nreality to bring it forth to call it forth and they have done\neverything they can to continue to make sure that we believe we are\npowerless this\nis why so many extraterrestrial races are coming here now  because\nthey know different on some level ladies and gentlemen we\nconsciously have called forth this drama this is really about us we\nhave called this forth this\nis really about us it is not about them and we need to step\ninto our power here we need to fully understand it is time for\nus to step into our power as a planetary race and not see the\nborders anymore now i would not be that opposed to a global government if it was set up\nwith a constitution like the u.s constitution and an absolute bill\nof rights but even then that is not a guarantee because if\npeople do not defend those rights if people do not defend\ntheir liberties what good is it we have\njust experienced that okay we have just experienced that in\n1913 when the federal reserve took over that is when the train\nstarted going the other way and here we are a hundred trillion\ndollars in debt \u2013 an absolutely ridiculous number it is\nprobably higher who knows now in creating our holographic model of a civilization or a social\nstructure do we want to have a monetary system do we actually need\na monetary system because we are the only ones that i am\naware of in our galaxy that still use a monetary system in\nfact many many years ago i had been asked by morenae vissaeus to put\ntogether a short presentation on money they already knew about it but i did the best that i could when\nit was over vissaeus just looked at me and he goes i\ndo not understand and\ni said what do you do not\nunderstand he\nsays i do not\nunderstand why you have to pay to live on a planet you were born on ladies\nand gentlemen that has haunted me ever since that little bit just\nthat one little thing takes you completely out of the box for the\nfirst time you begin to think well\njeez what would it look like not to have a currency you know advanced\ncivilizations all their\nneeds are taken care of all of their standard day-to-day life needs are met by the\ngovernment no strings attached and then you donate your time and\nyour expertise and your skills to do something you want that benefits\nthe whole i am not talking about communism either it is\nsomething bigger than that but we need some help in defining what\nthat is now we have a lot of really brilliant intelligent people here here and\nin the world i know other people around the world have been talking\nabout similar things creating a different society and maybe even a\nholographic society and what that looks like a holographic power\nstructure so no matter what happens it will totally always stand on\nits own the\nfounding fathers tried to do something like this when they created\nall the states as equal in control and separate from the\ngovernment that was pretty much their intent whether they realized\nit or not i\nalso want you to know that we have a lot of help we are getting a\nlot of help from the spiritual side as well as the dimensional side \u2013\nand i am not talking about just dimensional beings i am talking\nabout also extraterrestrials i will\ngive you an example of what i am talking about the vision at\nvalley forge of george washington i know that a lot of people on the\nnet if you have not researched it i suggest that you do some\nsay it is a hoax it is not a hoax i\nalso want you to know that thomas jefferson in his dairies was out\nwalking at his estate in monticello was trying to figure out the\nverbiage the language in regards to the declaration of independence\nwhen he was met by a hooded man who he never really clearly saw who\ngave him the conversation and the pieces that he needed to finish the\ndeclaration of independence i\nalso want you to know that in the constitutional hall when everybody\nwas bantering and going back and forth and it looked like no one was\ngoing to sign the declaration of independence up on the top railing\nof the hall a man appeared out of nowhere and for 20 minutes gave\nan oration about how important this was \u2013 not only to the\nunited states and to the moment \u2013 but to the entire world as a\nwhole as soon as he was done everybody rushed to the table and\nsigned the declaration of independence benjamin\nfranklin and the sergeant-at-arms went upstairs to try to talk to\nthis man because they wanted to know who he was there were armed\nguards at every single door the armed guards swore no one went in no one went out so there is divine providence here ladies and gentlemen it is not a\nmistake that you live in this country it is not a mistake that you\nare who you are enough\nis enough it is time we step into our power and very simple steps\nwill do this first you have to make a decision and the decision is no more bullshit okay no\nmore bullshit america\nis the reason it is because we allowed it to happen by our apathy okay we have elections we know we are voting for the lesser of\ntwo evils we know that but we do it anyway i\nalso want you to know that the president of the united states is not\nin charge of our government he is just not i want\nyou to know that there are 47 layers of top secret clearances above\nthe president of the united states forty-seven layers you\nwant to know your secret government that is your secret\ngovernment he cannot even get a clearance he does not\neven know who to talk to to get a clearance to find out about this\nstuff so it is important that we turn our focus a little bit and we start\ncreating something different this is what the founders did this is\nwhat many people have done throughout the world the renaissance was\nsomething exactly like this they threw off rome and they tried to do\nsomething different \u2013 rome the church the government of rome\n they threw it off and they tried to create something different and it went for a while mentoring the conversation in the exopolitics community in my personal\nopinion is no longer do\nufos exist it is\ncompletely irrelevant we already know they do where\ndo they come from that\nhas some validity is it\nmetal that does not\nhave any validity it does not matter what matters is why\nare they here and what can we do to learn from this experience now the reason that many of the extraterrestrial groups \u2013\nbenevolent \u2013 are not talking to the government is because they\nknow they are compromised i\nwill tell you that there has begun some mentoring off-world of our\nmilitary off-world it has begun but that is such a small piece what really needs to happen is we need to create a new domain\nof knowing and we need to\ncall this information directly to ourselves no more middle-men they\ncannot be trusted we have to do it ourselves now how do we go about that i do not have all those pieces the\nidea was to share it and plant the seed inside of all of you to start\nthinking about what does mentoring look like how\nwould you imagine extraterrestrials coming down and saying okay\nfolks you have pollution we can help you with that but these are\nthe steps you need to do here\u2019s the technology that already\nexists on your planet\nto do this and here is how you need to use it responsibly again self-responsibility food the growing of food water ladies and gentlemen we have the\ntechnology to have all the drinking water we want \u2013 just build\ndesalination plants we have all the water we need but they will not\nspend a dime on any of that because if you do not have water they have control over you we\nhave so much technology we have free energy on the earth tesla did\nit in 1902 we know it exists okay a\nhydrogen engine in a car was built in 1955 and did 110 laps at the\nindianapolis 500 race track the plans were bought by gulf-western\noil and never seen from again that is 1955 there is\njust so much there is so much the\nlaw of consistency which is what the andromedans call their holographic civilization is\nset up like this every\nchild whether they understand the knowledge or not is given the\nlatest and greatest technology or knowledge information data as it\narrives it starts at the youngest level it does not start at\nthe top and stay there and then they decide well we will wait till they are 25 to tell them about it it\nis not the same song we need the children to evolve to advanced\nmaturity a lot faster than they are yes they are growing up\npretty fast but not to advanced maturity every\nsingle piece of information every single tool that is available is\navailable to everyone across the board the children that graduate\nfrom school in the andromedan civilization are smarter than their\nparents and no one has a problem with that because they inherit the\nsociety they are the ones that continue to go out and expand\nthe society and create the holographic pillars of their society we\nare completely going backwards here and if that is not evident\nto everyone i do not know what is the\nlaw of consistency is that every truth is spoken everyone is\nforgiven there is no monetary system there is an absolutely free\nhealthcare system but it has nothing to do with pharmaceuticals it has to do with color light and sound which is what\nwe are even in our physicality color light and sound it\nhas to do with the advancement of the soul we have a damaged dna\nstructure so when we reincarnate we do not always remember things there are people who do great jobs doing past life regression and\npeople can pull some of those pieces but to have cognizant memory\nwhen you come back into physicality is something we do not have\npresently they have that because they do not have a damaged dna\nstructure can\nour dna structures be repaired according to them absolutely yes but we need to make some changes we\nneed to create the space for us to be free enough to explore those\npossibilities we cannot do that with the power structure that is\nin existence today so we need to create another domain\nof knowing and that\nbegins with yourselves the\nlove that you withhold is the pain that you carry lifetime after\nlifetime it all begins with us each one of us individually now ladies and gentlemen if we work start thinking start talking about\na mentoring relationship what that looks like how would we want to\nput it together even go so far as to say okay here\u2019s where we want to do this here\u2019s how we want to do\nit who do we want present do we televise it to the masses everything every detail they absolutely will meet us halfway they are not\ngoing to come in here and save us or rescue us from ourselves they are not going to do it if\nany of you are familiar with the andromedan information one of the\nthings that was first shared with me when i became an adult was that\nin our galaxy tyranny showed up very unexpectedly and them and\nother races that are part of the andromedan council have come back\nin time to this moment on our planet and the other star systems that\nare having problems with the pirates to this time period this\nshift in consciousness here is what flips it either way they are\ngoing to intervene and they have been intervening in very very\nsubtle ways because no one wants to live in tyranny not now or in\nthe future no one does so\nthis is our moment this is our moment as a humanity as a race to\nreally decide are or are\nwe not going to unite as one are we or are we not going to watch each others back are we\nor are we not going to stop taking crap from bureaucracy we\nhave to make a decision and that decision is upon you and you are\ngoing to be forced very very soon to make a decision and i am you know i am not just talking to you folks here in the\naudience i know that this is being streamed and i know that these\ndvds and things have a life of their own i know that better than\nanybody the\ntime is now and all it does it starts with you just to make a\ndecision \u2013 okay to do something to be radical to be\na rebel again most\nof us guys in this audience we know what that is like being a\nrebel we grew up shooting guns chewing toast into the shape of a\npistol okay rescuing the damsel excited about the next adventure\n we know about that you know that is part of who we are we\nare not domesticated lap dogs we are just not and i am\nnot going to be i am\nnot talking about going out and causing crimes i am talking\nabout defending yourself your liberties your rights your family\nand your community because nobody else is going to do it for you in\nfact they are all working against us and even they do not\nrealize what they are doing \u2013 they really do not because so much information is compartmentalized they do not\nrealize the big picture but\nmany people are waking up very very quickly and i know i am\npreaching to the choir in that but it is amazing to see how\nmany people are waking up and questioning everything this\nis our moment the next several years is our moment and it really\nneeds to begin now 2012 is not the end of the world \u2013 is not\ngoing to happen it is not our destiny however the earth will be going through some transitions because we will be\ncrossing the galactic plane and the galactic plane has an intense\nmagnetic gravitational field there will be changes it is\ninevitable mr green touched on some of that yesterday and others\nhave talked about this as well it is\ngoing to happen so you need to start thinking about where\ndo i really want to be okay if it is here fine make the best of it but create your\nspace of independence do not take it for granted any longer we\ncannot the\nwhole world is looking at us the asians the europeans  they cannot\nbelieve how stupid we are gospel they cannot\nbelieve how stupid we are they are like what is\nwrong with the americans you know i\ndo not have an answer do you you\nwatch tv what\ni had like to do because i do have some extra time is i would\nreally love to entertain some questions if that is all right okay thank you alex this is excellent and i want to address the\nmentoring suggestion because i think it is actually fascinating i think that this is coming directly from the andromedans that you have\nbeen in contact with yes it is mentoring is an interesting way of putting it okay if you mentor\nsomebody you do not rule them you do not tell\nthem what to do that is key nobody\nhere\u2019s even suggested this i think it is fascinating so\nwhat we have here is the notion that you can be in contact with\nbeings that can help teach you now this is going on this is going\non i am aware of it camelot is aware of it by god we\nwould not be here today if it was not for that there\nis mentoring going on but you do have to ask\nfor that to happen and you have to be as fully conscious in the\nprocess and as responsible and have that ability you cannot sit\nthere and ask them to do for you it is not what it is\nabout so\ni would love it if you would talk about that because you obviously\nhave been mentored so who better to teach us what does that look\nlike how is the interaction with you just\ndescribe and i know you have maybe talked to some degree but in\nyour interactions if you could discuss some of the ways they have\nmentored you to this point okay know that my mentoring has gone on with times that i have\nliterally been kicking and screaming the biggest portion of the\nmentoring has really been why\ndo i believe things and what it is that i believe so\na lot of times the question will come i will ask a question or i\nwill have a perspective and they will immediately come back and say well why do you believe\nthat what is your process of believing that that is true for\nexample religions it was one of the biggest things that i had when\ni was a kid and it was an issue that my father brought up to me as\nwell when i told him about this we\nhave formed perceptions of reality that are not based in reality they are only based on perception now in accepting that perception as reality what we do is we reinforce\nthat illusion and that is what we have done on earth is we\nhave reinforced the illusion about who we are about our strengths about our power about how we are supposed to live on the earth about being stuck on the earth about how we are supposed to raise\nour children we have all bought into these perceptions the\nhardest things were to really look at myself and this is really\nwhere the work is \u2013 it is always with yourself the most\ndifficult work has probably been for me in the last five six seven years questions\nlike well who am i they do not answer it they do not say well you are this and this and this but\nwhat they do is they will guide they have guided me to who it is\nthat i want to be first\nwas understanding that you are not just a physicality that is\nthe first thing to grasp \u2013 you are not a physicality and\njust like some of the speakers said yesterday \u2013 i believe it\nwas mr green who talked about there is a soul and it is 22\ngrams i think they have measured that in body weight that is really\nwho you are and connecting to who that person really is what that\nessence is all about you begin to realize oh\nmy god i am not at all who i thought i was i am\npurposely being vague because i do not necessarily want to tell\nyou who i am other than to say that who i am here on earth in this\nlifetime and the mistakes that i have made on some level i knew\nbetter not to make those mistakes okay but we do we do we\nexperiment we create as\nfar as the meaning of life they would never tell me what that was\nexactly all they would say is you\nare creating your own adventure so again the responsibility is on me as\nfar as mentoring \u2013 to want to talk and to speak \u2013 the\nidea was to just keep it very very simple to just share their\nperspectives and let the people do whatever they wanted with it and\nit does not matter whether anyone believes it or not people\nknow truth people know bullshit eventually it all comes to the\nsurface it has to because\nall of you are just like me you all know better you know what is\nreal it is just a question of detaching ourselves from our\naddiction to physicality and that is what it is now \u2013\nit is become an addiction because the focus is on the\nphysicality we are not objective anymore as\na soul when you have an out-of-body experience and you detach from\nyour physical form you are completely objective you have a\n360-degree peripheral view and that is because you are\nobjective you are not addicted you are not stuck in the\nbody or addicted to the body that is\nthe part that they have been working on with me the most is to\nactually feel and know that essence of myself as much as possible so when we talk about mentoring the mentoring is to get us from where\nwe are here to self-empowerment that is what i am talking\nabout once\nwe have achieved self empowerment \u2013 and it will not take\nlong folks it really will not take long \u2013 we will know\nexactly what to do because we are spiritual beings we are eternal there is no age to us and that is not a metaphysical blind that is a reality so the mentoring is to help us move out of our addiction to physicality\ninto full power as spiritual beings and it is not full of\ndogma it is not any of that it is all about\nintrospection voluntary introspection that is what it is thank you thank you audience\nmember #1 (am1 hi mr collier thanks for being here today i\nwanted to ask you something about something you mentioned in your\ninterview before you mentioned that an ancient race called the paa\ntal created human\nbeings probably so long ago i wondered if you could just elaborate\non that because i always wondered about it ever since you said it thanks it is believed that an ancient race \u2013 some of them call them\nthe founders other cultures call them the paa\ntal \u2013 created not\nonly the wormholes but created most of the physicality in what we\nknow as our universe because as they travel they are finding\ncivilizations and the ruins of civilizations far beyond anything that\neven they know and we are talking fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth-density space travelers who are traveling not\nonly in and moving in our physicality and other physicalities but\neven their own the\nwormholes is the best example that i have been given no one no\nadvanced space race has any idea how they were actually built but we\nknow that they exist in fact there are several that have snapped connecting our galaxy to some of the other nearby galaxies they have\nsnapped and no one knows how to fix them because we do not even\nknow how they were built am\n#2 (dan i am dan bender the one who is still working on\nthe streaming i was asked by the streaming audience which is now up\nto 1,500 members currently watching \u2013 and i think we have\nprobably have over 10,000 that tuned in on this particular segment thank you i have kind of picked three quick\nquestions hopefully they are quick that i was asked to pass\non they are randomly chosen so they may not be the best ones\nwe have got out there but what the heck one\nof the first ones was what\nfree energy devices do you know about one i know is magnetic essentially it was invented by a gentleman\nin tennessee it was just a bit larger than a shoebox and it was\ngenerated by magnetics it had an engine inside of it and it spun once you started it it would power a home completely independent no\nmatter where it was i\nunderstand that the gentleman and the technology vanished about eight\nyears ago he tried to get a patent on it and that is when he\nbasically went off the grid he actually demonstrated that technology\nand he began building that technology back in 1976 d\n the second question i have is can\nmentoring happen on the internet now i have to admit i was not completely paying attention to\neverything because i was so busy with everything on the internet but\nthat is the question i have i do not know that is a great question i do not\nknow i would not see why not d\n okay i guess we have to figure it out \u2013 one of my little side\njobs i have got to do last question i have here so i\ncan let some of the other folks get back in here how\ndo you deal with the greed issue i do not have an answer for that d\n okay i mean what is greed that they will never have enough it is\nbasically grounded in fear i would think fear of loss fear of\nabstinence fear of not having enough fear of loss to me that is\nwhat greed is it is just a fear can\nit become an addiction apparently it has but i\npersonally do not have an answer for that d\n thank you from the internet audience okay thank you audience\nmember #3 (am3 you mentioned about possible coming changes like\non a geological level to me it seems so chancy i had appreciate\nmaybe your thoughts on do\nwe just trust our intuition as far as where to go what to do how to\nplan for something like that or it seems a rather daunting thing to try to get your head around well you know change occurs all the time and you do things\nintuitively all the time as well whether you realize it or not you\nmight change the way you go home one day and do something different and then when you get home you find out that right where you would\nhave been there was a horrific car crash that in fact just\nhappened to my wife she did something completely out of the\nordinary for her and she would have been right\nthere so you know everybody has their guides everybody has their own\nintuition i am not always the most intuitive at times either the\nonly way i know to answer this is you just learn to trust yourself it could be that you will be guided to go out of town when\nsomething happens i do not have that answer or you will be\nright where you do not think you need to be but you are\ngoing to be there for a very very good reason and out of it will\ncome a self-empowerment that you never would have had before we\nall have our own paths and we are all creating our own realities we\nall have our own personal agendas for learning and growing and\nbecoming who we are your experience is going to be very different\nfrom mine i do not know how you know to tell you i\nmean hey if i had a hard date but i never do i do not get a\nhard date and i have made that mistake in the past about giving\nhard dates when in fact they were probabilities so\nthe fact is i do not know either but you just have to trust\nthat you will be exactly where you need to be when you need to be\nthere and i know that is kind of a foo-foo la-di-dah answer but that is my own experience as well you know that i just\nhave to pray and have faith that i will be exactly where i need\nto be am3 i appreciate that that is pretty much my take on it and i just\nwanted to kind of see where your thoughts were on that because to\ntry to take it from a mental perspective and plan and get out maps\nand seems a little absurd to me so i go in the other direction trusting in the flow of life so i appreciate that answer thank you exactly and personally i wrestle with that all the time i try to\nhave backup plan to backup plan to backup plan to backup plan and i\nspend all this energy doing this and it goes in a completely in a\ndifferent direction so audience\nmember #4 (am4 how\u2019re you doing thank you for being here i\njust have a question when you mentioned the thing about the 47\nlevels of government levels of security clearance am4 yeah security that the president does not even know that\nhe is not really in charge this happened 46 years ago of\ncourse but i was just wondering what are your thoughts on the\npurpose of president kennedy\u2019s assassination i just was\ncurious about that you know just wondering no no do not be sorry do not be sorry i just oooh man okay i will tell you my perspective on that eisenhower told kennedy about \u201954 [ed note that is when\neisenhower met with ets at muroc afb \u2013 now edwards afb \u2013\nand this was a key meeting of the negative ets that misled the us\ngovernment leading it down into the rabbit-hole trap that it now\nfinds itself in being unable so far to proceed forward with the\net/ufo disclosure so kennedy knew and he told bobby obviously one\nof the things that happened \u2013 and this has been documented\nthrough the great work that dr steven greer has done with the\ndisclosure project \u2013 is that most of the extraterrestrial\nknowledge and technology and exchange of technology went black three\nweeks after eisenhower knew about it so he did not\neven know where it was and this has been confirmed by one of his\nchief of staff brigadier\ngeneral langdon i believe it is ed\nnote sherman\nadams\nwas eisenhower\u2019s chief of staff a search of the military\u2019s\njoint chiefs of staff proved fruitless for \u201cbrigadier\ngeneral langdon so he shared all this with john kennedy and apparently where they felt\nthe hub of the loss of where this technology had gone and how far it\nwent black was something called the special operations coordinating\ngroup which was part of the national security council what\u2018s\ninteresting to note is that the first thing john kennedy did when he\ntook office was sign a presidential directive abolishing the special\noperations coordinating group now no one knows exactly who they are but they are not only\nconnected to the intelligence but also to all the black programs to\nthe secret space program and everything else there is some\nconjecture that these people are the governors of the federal\nreserve because they control the money and it is really all\nabout the money that is conjecture though i do not know\nfor a fact but what is interesting to note is that they had connections\neverywhere to everything because all the intelligence from above\nwould come to them and then they would decide which information the\npresident was supposed to get again those layers of security\nclearances what is\ninteresting to note is after the assassination the very first thing\njohnson did when he got back into the white house was recreate the\nspecial operations coordinating group now known as special group in\nthe national security council that is\nmy take on it am4 that is awesome but that time during the sixties of\ncourse as you know like four more  are they all just like a\nseries of random events or all they all different like you know king and bobby are they just all random occurrences of lone nuts\nlike james earl ray and all those guys and sirhan sirhan or are\nthey just a part of that whole thing i think that there are programs that overlap all the actions that\noccur in each country yes there are some lone nuts or individuals\nthat do things but there is also at the same time an\noverwhelming amount of evidence that many people have been\nbrainwashed and created to be hitters to \u201cgo wet and\ntake out people so i do not know but\nagain you know let us go back to operation paperclip a lot of\nthe brainwashing and mind control technology that the germans had\nbeen given was brought over here and they just continued operating\nhere under different names with new passports so it is very a\nbig and i do not know all the components it is\na very big question but on the surface does it look like it was\ndone on purpose i mean look at the individuals who they were they\nwere making change they were creating an awareness they were the\nfocal point of a very powerful movement for change to make things\nhappen for the betterment of everybody okay again that is the pyramidal power structure you lop off the head \u2013\nloss of knowledge it flounders somebody can come in and take\ncontrol and move it the other way then it does not exist so okay audience\nmember #5 (am5 hello sir thank you for being here you are welcome am5 first i wanted to thank you for bringing up a subject that i feel is\none of the most important things that we can talk about here at this\nconference as far as i can tell you are the first person to bring\nit up \u2013 it is the monetary system the economic system\nthat we predominantly use in this world my\nquestion is if you and/or the andromedans have any insight to offer\nas far as the transition that we will need in order to transcend\nan economic system that posits us in a position of feeling like we\nneed to compete with each other in order to survive making us feel\nseparated from each other instead of being one that is a great question and let me ask you this back what\nare your thoughts on it first am5 obviously you can tell by how i worded my question mentoring is about self-empowerment okay am5 that is right what are your ideas on it first you know it is great to ask\nsomebody for their advice when you do not have a clue what you\nwant to do but that can wrongly or to your betterment influence\nyou but it is better for you to have some idea about where you\nstand and why you stand on a particular position or a reason to make\na change than to have somebody tell you why and that is\nwhat they want they want us to come half way am5 i very much agree with that point as a matter of fact and i do\nhave a lot of my own opinions regarding how we can do it i just felt\nthat it was an important subject to bring back up i\nfeel that personally it goes back to something that you said\nregarding the creation of something that does not already exist\nin the world and never has before i feel that that is what we\nneed in the form of human interaction we can do this i mean as souls when we are not here on earth we have been in other civilizations that do not have a\nmonetary system we have this knowledge within us we do know we\njust do not have access to it at the moment but we do know all\nof us audience\nmember #6 (am6 thank you very much for being here i am very\ninspired by your message it is an honor for me am6 thank you and for us too my question to you is you spoke earlier\nabout the whole thing of the domain\nof knowing and you know the intention that we have together and how at one point there was\nnot this whole human rights so how can we come together as a group collectively in creating an intention for the world that we want to\nsee how\ncan we you know all of us are asking what\ncan we do what can we\nall do to collectively share our intentions of the world that we want\nto see the world that we want to create they\nhave their intention but perhaps we need to collectively have ours\nand align together about the world we envision i am wondering\nif you have any advice or counsel or mentorship about how we can\nunite in that way and gather our intentions to create the world we\nknow to be true in our hearts we know is possible for us to live in that we remember that is the first step just talking with your friends people\nof like mind just creating that vortex of knowledge of harmonic of\nfrequency and as you begin to talk more and more about it your\ngroup grows i will\ngive you an example the best example that comes to mind is in\ncolorado there were a group of women who were the wives of soldiers\nover in iraq what\nthey did was they formed something called the kitchen\nmilitia \u2013 okay where they would all get together not only share recipes and about\nrearing children yadda yadda yadda and sharing information and\nletters about their spouses overseas but they would also start\ntalking about different ideas some\nincredible ideas came out of the kitchen militia several of them\neven started companies of ideas that came out and now they are\nemploying many of the people within\nthe kitchen militia so it is very simple steps and again individually this has to be\nat grassroots all it takes is a focus a turn of our focus away from\nthe drama and the crap that they want us to focus on on the news and\ncnn etcetera and start thinking about what is it that i want what\ninformation do i want to know what do i want to hear what\ninformation do i want to hear on the news what kind of neighborhood\ndo i want to live in what do i want to talk to my friends about what is really important to me and\nladies and gentlemen back in 1993 i was telling everybody to throw\ntheir televisions away i really was you know i told you so okay i\nmean we have one and we just watch movies and we choose which movies\nwe want i do have rabbit ears so that i can watch the election to\nfind out who is going to screw us for the next four years\n and that is roughly it and the super bowl but now i\ncan get that online so now i do not even have to plug in the\nrabbit ears so you know you guys know this stuff you know this stuff you just\nhave to want it you just have to want it you have got to want it so\nbad that you are willing to just do it and say enough\nis enough you\ndo that with your kids you do that with your neighbors you do that\nwith your bosses now you have got to do it about your life what\nis it that you really want get some clear distinct ideas about what\nit is   you really want because the system we have now is crumbling\nand it is going to continue to crumble all the illusion in the\nworld is not going to keep it standing because it is run its\ncourse it is done so we have to create something else we have to because if we do not the powers that be will create it for us and i guarantee\nyou you will not be free you will not be free you will not\nlike it at all you will not it is a given an\nabsolute given because it is all about them it is not\nabout you and as spock once said the\nneeds of the many outweigh the needs of the few next\nquestion audience\nmember #7 (dave alex my name is dave\nfarman i represent\nalienshift  www.alienshift.com the page we made for you is between 200 and 250 pages it is\none of the most visited alienshift is about new hope for humanity\nand you are one of the we could call you the new hope for\nhumanity i want to thank you for all the stuff you have done basically my question is i am sorry you want to say\nsomething it is not about me it is not about me da\nit is all about us and the question i have is about us the\npublic every ufologist the past 30 years i have been watching they write books and videos and they go home there is no unity there is no group that can how can we create such a 40-man\ninternational group that would have a leader like you for instance or whoever else would want to take the position and we have our\nvoice with the et and with the people of the earth to\nthe audience] you guys are all waiting for governments do not\ndo that do not do that we are\nthe governments between humanity and the et do not wait for any\ngovernments to help you guys audience\nmember #8 (am8 hi thanks for coming today we all appreciate\nthat i guess a question i have is i kind of have a profound\nquestion or somewhat profound i guess which is to say that on the\none hand i think that we all want to access knowledge and we want to\nknow what is going on and that is empowering on\nthe other hand it is also true that the more we know to a certain\nextent the more of a target we become i think that that is just\nbecause of the fact especially the way that we have had a lot\nof laws that have been passed throughout the world to monitor what\npeople are doing i think we all have to be cognizant of that i am\nasking what do you think how can we access we know that there is\npowers that are off-planet we know that the major self or the higher\nself is one of purity and strength how do we access that in the face\nof the fact that we do put ourselves \u2013 i do not know if\nit is at risk\n\u2013 but that we put ourselves in somewhat of a precarious\nposition and that we are facing a very very organized and very\nstrong union across the planet and\nhow do we get there how do we empower ourselves i guess that is\nwhat i want to ask okay let us deal with the first of these i want you to do me\na favor just for a moment i want you to get down on your knees give\nhim the mike just get down on your knees okay i want you to get\ndown on your knees yeah just like that look at me i want you to\nlook at me can you look at me am8 it is not what i was expecting but do you want to live the rest of your life like that am8 no not particularly no okay then stand up then stand up dude you are  eternal soul all they can do is take this [the\nbody] away from you and you still live okay it is not who we\nare  it is what\nwe are as\nfar as forming an organization it needs to be grassroots because\neverything else that becomes a foundation or a corporation they take\nover if it is grassroots and everybody in this audience and\nevery citizen around the world \u2013 if we start watching each\nothers back there is not jack\nthat they can do to us there just\nis not am8 i hear you i hear you okay that was dramatic thanks audience\nmember #9 (am9 i got up because i wanted to assert that we are the\nground crew and that we are being mentored and find out if you\ndisagree with that that this is the choir and that we are being\nmentored already whether we have been tapped on the shoulder by\nsomeone from another part of the galaxy or not that we should stop\ndenying that we are already being mentored and we already are\ngetting the message of what it is that we need to do well i think george said it best yesterday mr green we\nare extraterrestrials you know we are just trying to reconnect to kin basically so yeah you are absolutely right i do not have\nany problem with that my\npurpose for reiterating it is knowing that these things go wherever\nthey go and that there are so many people now coming into this discovering it for the first time or at least asking questions and\nit is important to bring them on board as quickly as possible to just have them to plant the seed hey on some level you are already being mentored spiritually and we\njust need to bring the physicality and connect that to the spiritual\nlessons of ourselves am9 thank you great that was my purpose audience\nmember#10 (am10 i was just wondering about the nature of the\nincoming object what was the question sorry i am a little nervous here nobody will bite you yeah you mentioned an incoming object 22 degrees to uranus or\nsomething eighteen degrees right ascension of neptune\u2019s orbit all i know\nis that it is a planetary structure and it is friendly i\ndo not know anything more about it at the moment but i know\nit is friendly okay it is not nibiru audience\nmember #11 (am11 i have a question but as i was standing there i\nhad a realization you were talking about the holographic kind of\nsystem that they have put in place and that you said that we need\nto implement that holographic system when you said we need to become\ngrassroots everything has to become grassroots i got\nit on an extreme level\nthat by continuing to share passionately with absolutely everyone that we are creating the holographic system that they cannot\ndestroy that is right it is impossible i really got it thank you you are very welcome my question is you were mentioning that the andromeda have the dna\nto be able to remember past lives and that our dna is damaged so we\ncannot do you know of ways in which we can heal our dna and would\naccessing the blueprint of perfect health and healing in our higher\nself be part of that it is a great question i do not have the answer to that thank you and i had to put my glasses on to see who i was talking to audience\nmember #12 (am12 okay my take on the grassroots thing and tell\nme if i am right is that even if we are not out talking if you are doing your spiritual work and in your mind you have a\ndesire for a world that is peaceful and pure and good without\nthe hatefulness and the fear and you are creating that that\nthat is the\ngrassroots thing that it\ndoes not have to be an organization that is exactly right thank you you got it now i wanted to bring up something i have been blessed to have an\nopportunity to spend some time in europe and i was in switzerland we had just come out of a pub and there were some young men being\narrested for some reason \u2013 and i will never forget this as\nwe are standing there watching this happen one of the young men\nsaid to the swiss police you\ndid not read me my rights and\nthe cop stopped and goes what\nrights he\ngoes i got rights you\ngot to read me the miranda act and this was a swiss student okay and\nhe goes this is\nswitzerland you do not have any rights here okay but this young man believed so much in that that he was willing to\nchallenge the police officer about it \u2013 okay and it\nwas a big surprise for him so you see the influence that the united states has had on the world is\nso  more profound than any of us realize and the disappointment\nis probably equal to that at this point \u2013 okay because here\nthe propaganda has been communism fascism we have sent young men to\nwar lost their lives to fight communism and fascism and in 60\nyears we become fascist what is wrong with this picture to\naudience] sir two more questions and then i am done audience\nmember #13 (am13 i wanted to preface this question with just\nsaying again as i spoke with you in private it is an honor and\na privilege to have you here with us and thank you for speaking of\nwhat you know i also wanted to say that i do not want this\nquestion to sound in any way hostile to anyone because it does come\nfrom the bottom of my heart  and it is\nsomething that has been bothering me for a long time if\nwe are to move forward and connect all the pieces of the puzzle and\nmove forward into the holographic social structure that you are\ntalking about where the children know more than the adults and where\nall information is given to the young then why is it that we still \u2013\neven in disclosure movements and with courageous witness testimony\ncoming forward people speaking \u2013 that there are still certain\ntopics that people are afraid to or will resist talking about such\nas the stargates that was mentioned earlier this morning and other\nthings so is your question exactly why there are still some topics\npeople do not want to discuss right in people who are courageously stepping forward and risking\ntheir lives to speak out about what they know why is it that they do\nnot speak about everything that they do know and there are still\ntopics that they do not wish to speak about well that is a great question and i am also guilty of that it is a comfort zone it is a comfort level and everything\nhas its own timing what\nwould happen to humanity if the government were to come clean about\neverything that they know about everything that they know could\nhumanity totally deal with it probably a portion of humanity could\ndeal with it the\nother portion or portions or groups could not maybe deal with it\nat least in the very beginning because they have constructed a\nreality around themselves that is based on perception that is an\nillusion to shatter that all in one fell swoop can be a disservice\nto them the\nidea is to take people and give them the tools that they need so that\nthey voluntarily begin the process of self-responsibility and\nvoluntary introspection the information is there and it is been\nout there for 50 60 years we will\ntake the ufo community as a whole exopolitics more and more people\nare coming into this who is the biggest group now it is the\nyoung people which is promising they are in fact influencing their\nparents by having discussions at home what do you think about this what do you think about that so it does not matter how it\nhappens as long as it happens now i mentioned dulce in our conversation earlier there will be people i am sure who will contact these two\n[ed note referring\nto speakers duncan o\u2019finioan and david corso whose\npresentations preceded this one to really want to talk about that and they are going to have to\nbe very careful about how they present the information because the\nthings that happened there are horrific \u2013 absolutely horrific \u2013\nand they had to be dealt with and they were dealt with however that element that was behind those atrocities still exists here okay and even i do not want to talk about that because it\ninvolved women and children and that is as far as i will\ngo but\nnow that i have mentioned it i have created a domain\nof knowing okay i have\njust created a domain of\nknowing now each of you\nwill start going out thinking about that doing some research to\npull that information to you because now you want to know thank you very much you are welcome last two questions audience\nmember #14 (am14 my question was actually about children and the\ndisappearance of children if you are willing to talk about it i have said so much about that already i know that i\nhave been blasted about that ladies and gentlemen i absolutely know\nwhat i know about the missing children and i am not going to\napologize for it i stand by what i said all those years ago and i\nstand by it today okay could you summarize because we are aware of this as\nwell so if you could just in maybe one sentence we have\nbecome a natural resource very much how we use cows and other\nanimals we ourselves have become a natural resource the younger\nones are the most desirable because they are not tainted with\nchemical poisons in their bodies because they are young that is\nall i am going to say laura knight-jadczyk\nhas gone into this in depth and rich dolan has also written a review\nof her book that is very positive and rich has and alfred\nwebre published an article about the subject so if you want to\ninvestigate it further because actually i just want to augment what alex is saying here in the\nsense that the point is not to give you everything out on a platter \u2013\nokay for you to understand what is going on the point\nis to give you direction what\nalex is doing here is mentoring you he is giving you\nindications and that is what our whistleblowers do by the way they do not tell you everything they do not even tell us\neverything but they give us the clues that we need to do the\nresearch necessary to find out the truth and when you hit the truth it gets you you can tell you know\nit you\nwant to be in denial go right ahead it is out there the truth\nis out there it is unbelievably\nout there audience\nmember #15 (am15 hi alex i am the last question obviously my name is andreas please do not take this the wrong way but i\nlove you man my\nactual question is actually directed to the audience and to you i\nwas wondering if you would not mind conducting a little\nmini-meditation for all of us to direct our intention to change the\nfuture that we want to have i was wondering if you would like to do\nthat thank you ooo i am on the spot well this\u2019ll be a\nfirst i\nhave an affinity for very simple common-sense spirituality which has\nalways lead me to the native americans so what i will do is i will\nclose this with a native american prayer and that just happens to be\nthe same prayer that is on the front page here that i have with\nme it is\nusually always the prayer that i go to i change the words and make\nthem my own after all these years but for the purposes of this it\nsays exactly what i would want to say great\nspirit whose voice i hear in the winds and whose \nbreath\ngives life to all in the world hear me i\nam small and i am weak and i need your strength and your wisdom let\nme walk in beauty and let my eyes ever behold the \nred\nand purple sunsets that you have created with me make\nmy hands respect the things that you have made \nand\nmy ears sharp to hear your words and your voice let\nme learn the lessons that you have hidden under every rock and leaf i\nseek strength not to be greater than my brother but\nto fight my greatest enemy \u2013 myself make\nme always ready to come to you with clean hands and \nstraight\neyes so that when my life fades as the fading \nsunset my spirit can come to you without shame amen ladies\nand gentlemen it is been an absolute honor for me thank you so\nmuch long\napplause standing ovation]\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0kerry\n                  cassidy (kc hi i am kerry cassidy from\n                project camelot.bill ryan (br and i am bill ryan this is sunday the 26th of july 2009 have i got that right i personally\n                  want to say that i am delighted to be here with steven\n                  greer of all the people who we get emails asking us to interview you are number one on quite a long list the reason for that\n                  is that people see project camelot as continuing to kick the\n                  ball that was kicked off by the disclosure project back in\n                  1993 you started something that we are doing our best\n                  to support you with in terms of bringing the truth to the world steven greer (sg oh good thank you we want to thank you for that oh you are welcome thank you so we have some questions for you but they might\n                  not be the most comfortable of questions oh i can take any questions okay and we have heard that you are not\n                  a wilting violet as they call it or whatever so what we are\n                  wondering here because we have different philosophies i\n                  think and different approaches and i think that is really\n                  interesting i know that we started out maybe at the same place in terms\n                  of we are taking witness testimony \u2013 and certainly\n                  you did \u2013 and that tactic was very effective and has\n                  stimulated us to go down the road we went on we have been\n                  doing this for a little over three years now i just wondered if you have a philosophy that you feel like or a trajectory that brought you from witness testimony to\n                  free energy and if you could talk a little bit about that\n                  road well obviously the disclosure project involves\n                  many elements one is the disclosure of the fact that we are\n                  not alone the other is that there are highly classified projects that\n                  have been run illegally for about 50 over 50 years dealing\n                  with this and number three you cannot say that this has been kept\n                  secret and it is real without giving la raison d\u2019etre why would something like this be kept secret?now in the early days it could be argued that well there\n                  were religious issues that the people would panic at the idea\n                  that there was life in outer space or that there were theological\n                  objections and in fact these still exist i had a junior jet propulsion laboratory scientist say the\n                  reason that some of the information about the ancient structures\n                  on mars has been withheld is that it would \u201ccollapse\n                  the foundations of all orthodox religions in the world to\n                  which i said great i mean it is time people who think the world\u2019s\n                  6,000 years old and we rode dinosaurs bareback need to get\n                  a life we agree with that yeah okay so that was one area but the largest one and this is when everything went deep black in october 1954 \u2013 we\n                  know it to the day \u2013 was because they had actually figured\n                  out and mastered the electromagnetic gravitic propulsion\n                  systems so that was 55 years ago right okay so 55 years ago there was the ability to master\n                  those technologies and obviously when the rockefeller commission that reorganized the department of defense and the cia was\n                  put together by eisenhower what they did was reorganize it\n                  in a way so that these sort of issues were handled under work\n                  for other programs and aerospace contracting entities and\n                  high-tech entities and really took it out of the oversight\n                  of the president and the congress.and that is when it all \u201cwent south and\n                  has been that way ever since the reason for that is because if you acknowledge that ufos\n                  are real the very next thing that any bona fide scientist\n                  or policy analyst is going to ask is well how in the\n                  hell are they getting from one star system to another and when that question is asked it will be answered because\n                  we have people on our team who can answer it in great detail yeah they are not going around in rocket ships and when that is answered \u2013 i am trying\n                  to finish one thought here \u2013 when that is answered you are\n                  going to then see the end of oil gas coal nuclear power all of it there is a five-hundred-trillion-dollar asset\n                  base that they are sitting on and protecting two or three\n                  hundred people in corporations in the world control half the\n                  wealth of the planet \u2013 the net worth of the planet so the secrecy has to be understood within a larger macro-economic\n                  geopolitical crisis where there is been accretion of enormous\n                  power in the hands of relatively few people and that this\n                  has gotten worse not better since the gilded age of the industrial\n                  revolution\u2019s dawn it is actually worse now than\n                  it was in the time of cornelius vanderbilt and the rockefellers it is worse now than it was yeah i definitely understand so that i think is and so our focus as\n                  we have learned more and more about the reasons for the\n                  secrecy and the kinds of technologies that are extant is that\n                  we have concluded that it is very very important to be\n                  able to bring out those energy systems \u2013 at least what\n                  i call the \u201clevel one systems the ones that you\n                  could put on a box over here something about the size of\n                  a coffee table and i have seen these now of course seeing them and being able to bring them out\n                  and having people release them is another matter but i have\n                  seen them they extract energy from some would call the zero-point\n                  energy field some would call it the quantum vacuum flux field whatever you want to call it but in the fabric of space-time\n                  around us there is enormous electromagnetic potential\n                  that can be touched into and brought out and that is one of\n                  the practical implications of disclosure i mean there are many implications one is informational one is diplomatic contact and one is the issue of the science\n                  and technology which could transform the planet get us off\n                  of oil stop global warming end the crisis of the have and\n                  the have-nots and the poverty in the world so that i think resonates with many people.there are a certain number of people who are interested in\n                  extraterrestrial life there is a much larger number of\n                  people who are concerned about the environment energy crisis the poverty in the world etcetera so is what you are saying that what you were\n                  propelled towards is the latter because i know your emphasis\n                  is now really free energy or it seems to be no it is not no no no well it seems to be maybe i misunderstand you need to not mis-state my priorities let me\n                  be very clear on this we have three programs going on with\n                  equal bore \u2013 equal bore \u2013 simultaneously oh really okay number one is cseti the center for the study\n                  of extraterrestrial intelligence which is an interplanetary interstellar diplomatic initiative that was the founding\n                  entity and it is still the primary focus the second is the disclosure project that started as project\n                    starlight when i was briefing the cia director and the\n                    clintons and all these people.it then evolved into the disclosure project when clinton said i\n                    will not do it because i will end up like jack kennedy and\n                    the congress people that we met with said this is too\n                    big a fish for us to reel in we are not going to do\n                    it.so it kind of devolved onto our shoulders then that is\n                  why we did in 2001 \u2013 to correct the date \u2013 the\n                  national press conference event and the disclosure project and that still continues we still continue to do that.then the third is the orionproject.org and the focus on trying\n                  to identify people who have an understanding of these new physics\n                  and sciences so we can bring out some of the practical applications okay so those three things are going on with equal bore we have teams of people working on all of them oh i see i am sort of the coordinator or head of those\n                  three projects but they are interrelated they are\n                  actually three sides of a pyramid or whatever not pyramid but three sides of one entity and three facets that are interlocking i had a misunderstanding part of the reason is\n                  because no that is good that you brought it up because\n                  a lot of people do have that misunderstanding we get a newsletter the orion project or however you refer to it newsletter comes into my inbox\n                  and it is you know exclusively talking about more of the\n                  free energy side of things so it is a misconception you know but is out there as you say it is very interesting\n                  to hear that you are continuing these other yeah and people have to understand you know\n                  people say what about disclosure i say we have the testimony of 110 of these military\n                    witnesses out there we have dvds and other materials and\n                    books out there with thousands of pages of government documents we have put this positive proof and testimony out there and\n                  that then has launched a worldwide disclosure movement in many many countries as you know mm-hm at this point when we started that endeavor it\n                  was 30 or 40 percent of the public thought these were real now it is 80 percent some countries \u2013 in polls\n                  that they did recently here in spain it was 90-some percent \u2013 think\n                  that we are not alone and ets are real.so we feel that the big over-arching strategy of establishing\n                  that fact happened what has not happened is at least within\n                  america an official acknowledgement of the issue and the ending\n                  of the secrecy but this is due to a complex problem that i\n                  work on behind the scenes for that is where the problem\n                  is.the problem is within majestic and the problem is within\n                  conventional political leaders and the military-industrial\n                  complex when we started this effort i had about a third of this majestic\n                  group who thought what we were doing was something they would\n                  support now it is 70 percent now the other 30 percent\n                  would probably like to see me dead but the point is \u2013 and they are vicious \u2013 there\n                  are 70 percent of them now who are really lining up this includes\n                  the elements within majestic that are in europe that are within\n                  the masonics that are within a lot of secret organizations\n                  that are fed up with the secrecy and know that we are\n                  at the end of how far we can take this silly game of secrecy\n                  and secret power so a lot of the work that i have been doing and it has\n                  directly to do with disclosure has to do with trying to fix\n                  that highly dysfunctional dynamic which cannot be ignored you cannot pretend like those lions are not out lurking\n                  in the jungle you do not have to capitulate but you\n                  have to try to educate them and give them another vision.one thing i say to the people is that people who are addicted\n                  to secret power it is kissinger once said power is\n                  the ultimate aphrodisiac that then the secret power would\n                  be that on steroids and viagra and every other thing \u2013 quite\n                  blunt and so one of the real issues becomes what can you you\n                  cannot just take away you have to give so my job is to try to also give some of these leaders both\n                  conventional leaders and people who are within these classified\n                  projects a new vision \u2013 a vision that can guide the\n                  world out of its current direction into a path of peace safety justice free energy and a whole new transformation of our\n                  civilization on this planet \u2013 very quickly because you know we have run out of time in my opinion i do not think we have another 50 or 100 years to fritter\n                  away as it happens neither do they i mean what we\n                  get from our secret witnesses and from people that are exposed\n                  to the illuminati philosophy constantly is that our time is\n                  running out in terms of like we just heard from a secret witness \u2013 and i am\n                  running this by you to hear whether this coincides with what\n                  you know \u2013 that there is around ten months left of food\n                  before it runs out on the planet and that there is another\n                  three to four years worth of oxygen i mean i do not know if this is down to the minute or\n                  not or whether it is more vague than it was stated to me or\n                  more you know where you would fall in that category in\n                  terms of how you understand that let me say that there are a lot of my father-in-law\n                  used to famously say paper does not refuse ink and\n                  in the modern era that the computer screen does not refuse\n                  digits so in other words anything can be said now one has to my own assessment of that is that\n                  there are competing interests that try to use whatever axis\n                  that they have to provide a certain paradigm that is highly\n                  eschatological the eschatological axis within majestic is\n                  a very powerful one i remember meeting with a member of a royal family in europe\n                  back in the \u201890s and his entire purpose in providing\n                  funding to abduction researchers was to \u2013 and i know\n                  who they are all the mainline ones \u2013 was so that they\n                  would put the information out to the public so that the public\n                  would learn to hate enough of the aliens so that we could have\n                  an interplanetary war which would be the armageddon that would\n                  precipitate the return of christ yeah we have heard this now this was a very specific opus dei perspective\n                  and that is really what is driving it is like\n                  ahmadinejad in iran saying that well it would be okay if\n                  we went to nuclear war with israel because that would force\n                  this twelfth imam which is their return of their christ to\n                  return to iran sure so this eschatological end the world perspective\n                  is so you are actually saying just to cut to\n                  the chase here you are saying that this man\u2019s testimony to what i just said about ten months and four years is basically\n                  him being programmed by the controllers in a certain sense well it is \u201cthrough a glass dimly in other words yes we are headed for a crisis yes we are headed towards a hiatus can i call it\n                  that in the situation but what they do not understand is that it is the end\n                  of one era and the opening of another it is not the end\n                  of life on earth it is not going to be the end of the human\n                  race on this planet these are all we would certainly agree with that this is and so the conflation of certain\n                  misinterpreted spiritual traditions whether it is from\n                  the book of revelations or elsewhere or the mayan calendar\n                  and 2012 has created this sort of eschatological juggernaut \u2013 which\n                  is very scientological it is very majestic and it has\n                  a lot of underpinnings within the philosophy of why the secrecy\n                  has continued on like it is this is one major axis of why the secrecy is continuing the\n                  other one is the technological and money and control the macro-economic\n                  control of the planet.my point to people is that for example now i have\n                  been doing this for 19 years and i have had you\n                  know if you brief the cia director you have had some good\n                  access and that is 16 years ago my family put the first\n                  man on the moon so i have had access to people within classified\n                  projects for a lot of my life for example \u2013 and i know that we are going to probably\n                  disagree on this because i saw what you wrote on your blog\n                  after my talk last night \u2013 there are people who have\n                  been exposed to what they wanted them to see this bob lazar\n                  was one that they then allow to speak out now the question is what is the agenda behind that\n                    allowing?i have had more than a dozen people who have worked in facilities\n                  in dulce and in pine gap in australia and other places where\n                  they have actually been growing the gray and reptilian\n                  species that people think are ets and the people who have been in the projects think they are\n                  working alongside an alien \u2013 and they are not they are\n                  absolutely what are called nano-bio-machines and they\n                  are programmed life forms there is no question that\n                  that is going on so the larger question becomes if someone comes up to\n                    you with just an empirical observation what is it they are\n                    seeing now i am going to cross over into something even more\n                  controversial we have some people at lockheed and another program i\n                  cannot say where it is but it is in the south in\n                  an underground facility and its chief scientist is someone\n                  i knew very well they have developed electromagnetic systems where they can\n                  put someone into a state and they can go into \u2013 and\n                  this gets into a cosmological complex discussion now \u2013 a\n                  lower astral or denser astral field and some would call this demonic they can actually see beings and creatures there and bring\n                  them in three-dimensional and materialize in flesh and blood \u2013 through\n                  these electronics so a lot of these things that people are seeing have nothing\n                  to do with interstellar and extraterrestrial so when i am talking when i talk about the interstellar\n                  civilizations that also have transdimensional capability you cannot go through interstellar space at the speed\n                  of light or less right but there is a cosmological indigestion happening\n                  within ufology and disclosure that i find disturbing because\n                  people are conflating interdimensional with extraterrestrial with plfs that are programmed life forms man-made all of this is being put together as if it is one thing and\n                  it is not it is unfortunately much more complex\n                  than this this is exactly why we would agree with that as well it is very\n                  complex this is why when martin cannon back in the late \u201880s put together a 2000-footnoted paper and collection proving\n                  the military-human involvement with abductions and that the\n                  creatures they were using were not et it was not some\n                  alliance between majestic and these ets the ets would not\n                  bother with \u2019em.now i say they are aliens but they are\n                  not extraterrestrials okay and now we are getting\n                  into and people say i am being cheeky i am\n                  not because these are very bizarre creatures some of them\n                  even i am going to take it one step further.you have all heard of roswell and you have all heard\n                  that there have been a number of electromagnetic weapons systems\n                  that have targeted and knocked down interstellar vehicles not at a great kill rate in the early days i\n                  hate to use the words kill rate it is terrible but\n                  it is become more and more efficient since sdi and since\n                  the \u201890s particularly in the last five or ten years what happened however in the early days they had enough\n                  crude stuff and of course we had things like the philadelphia\n                  experiment \u2013 which did not happen in philadelphia it\n                  happened in rhode island that was just a cover story that is\n                  another whole discussion but that was in the \u201840s so there were very advanced\n                  electronics that were already being used and by the time the\n                  extraterrestrials showed up when we were detonating nuclear\n                  weapons we were able at roswell at our only nuclear bomb\n                  squadron to have one of these weapons and a radar dome or\n                  configuration that caused the two of those to crash right there were bodies on that some of them were living and i have a witness who actually handled one of the living\n                  ones as late as 1950-\u201951 here in virginia not far from\n                  where i live at camp pearry  p-e-a-r-r-y a very top secret facility ed note greer means camp peary army experimental training center near williamsburg]now what is interesting is that that genetic material\n                  from some of those bodies has subsequently been cloned from\n                  a number of different species now you know i have a daughter with a ph.d in neuroscience\n                  and genetics from the most prestigious university in the world what i have done is i have looked at this sort of what the current state of neuroscience is in the non-classified\n                  world is that if they wished to they could take cells from\n                  a human and clone them absolutely sure yes now imagine what has existed within the classified\n                  world because these were the people who were the these\n                  were the humans who were the spiritual descendants of mengele\n                  and the nazis wernher von braun and that whole cell you are talking about the scientists the scientists who were brought into these classified\n                  projects and who were at the foundation of the cia and the\n                  early space program so the highly compartmented programs that\n                  deal with this issue yeah and this is the thing everyone talks about antigravity\n                  and this and that but what they forget are the enormous advances\n                  that have happened between the early \u201840s and now in\n                  genetics and bioengineering and neuroscience those have gone into application where they now have created\n                  these creatures that people think oh that is an\n                  extraterrestrial i say it is not an extraterrestrial so the whole thing has deliberately become confused so that\n                  people will make an assessment that there are the good aliens\n                  and the bad aliens and if we step into that \u201ccowboys and indians mindset they can then divide the human race into another war footing\n                  that will fulfill the majestic plan that was hatched in the \u201850s that will take us as douglas mcarthur said in his last address\n                  to the congress to interplanetary war which is the world\n                  war iii they want right so most of retail ufology \u2013 i would say 90-plus\n                  percent of it \u2013 has embedded within it this message and\n                  this information and these images for the purpose of majestic now i think people do it completely innocently because right i want to ask a direct question here because this\n                  is personal and i have not said this on camera before so here we go i am an abductee and i am a mountaineer i was abducted out of my tent in december 1981 in the himalayas\n                  on the slopes of makalu which is in nepal on the border of\n                  tibet and that was not done by the military this was done in december in winter in the himalayas i was\n                  taken out of my tent floated over the glacier in the middle\n                  of the night and it was minus 40 degrees this was not\n                  the military who were doing that they could not do that i am not saying all contact has been military i am being very specific i am saying that there is\n                  enough let us look if you have a nugget of gold\n                  and you dump a whole bunch of fool\u2019s gold on it sure and no one\u2019s doing an assay and the\n                  question becomes what part of it is extraterrestrial what part of it is interdimensional exactly what part of it is manmade and\n                  what part of it is some mixed-up where people and here i will make it a little more complicated there\n                  are people who have had et contact and when these classified\n                  projects find out about it they will then target them for an\n                  abduction so that their paradigm and their perception of this\n                  will become confused this is okay i think what happens here we are aware\n                  of this level that you are talking about we are\n                  aware of all these different dimensions because we have\n                  basically dimensions not dimensions but \u201cdimensions\n                  of this argument because we have been exposed\n                  to these levels by different secret witnesses okay but and i think if we have a disagreement what it is is i do not know if it is completely you know it is not an either/or question it is a how\n                  much it is a percentage as you say it is going to be is there sometime abductions that\n                  are et-related that are real et-related \u2013 okay and\n                  handled by a certain group of ets is there a milab element\n                  to it and is that maybe the largest portion highly probable okay?but is it exclusively that there are only good ets i think\n                  that when you extrapolate that that is where i have a\n                  problem i think the problem is with the caricature of the because i think that that is philosophically a problem of a limited way of looking at reality no i think the problem is a manichean\n                  view that has to divide entire species into good and bad this\n                  is precisely what hitler did when he would say you know the\n                  jews are bad and they are dirty and they are this i\n                  think we have to be extremely careful i do not think it is necessary to do that\n                  quite so much as it is in terms of the overall i mean were talking universes okay we are talking multiple\n                  species out there that go beyond this solar system certainly oh i am very aware of that and we are talking about life in general okay so but the point is that i do not think we can sit here and make a statement\n                  like what i heard you say on stage yesterday which was there\n                  are no bad ets i mean how absurd no i think you could say that there is no evidence\n                  that the planet has been invaded by hostile \u2013 is\n                  the word i used \u2013 civilizations that have an intent so far to you that you have not in other\n                  words you cannot prove a negative this is axiomatic what i can say well then we have a problem you cannot prove a negative in other words that is the point no no but it is the point you cannot prove\n                  a negative but what you can do is go with the evidence that\n                  you do have one of the sets of evidence we have through cseti which has\n                  gone around the world and made contact all over the world with\n                  thousands of people we have never had a harmful event happen we have never had anything resembling anything that has frightened\n                  or harmed anyone on the contact team.on the other hand we have had members of our team that have\n                  been targeted with these psychotronic-related military-type\n                  abduction events including myself right i agree so what i have to go with is the evidence that\n                  i have i also know that there is the stage craft to use an institute for strategic studies document that i have that talks about the stage craft of abductions because of its\n                  psychological warfare value to the agenda of an us versus\n                  them manichean  worldview\n                  that would redound to the benefit of the military-industrial\n                  complex so this is very circular.i think that what i am saying is one has to be very careful\n                  if you are going to be involved with disclosure and contact\n                  in saying this group is bad this group is good we are good and we are bad and we are slipping\n                  right back into the israelis versus the palestinians the jews\n                  versus the christians the muslims versus the whatever okay but this is not where we are going but if you say that there are bad aliens\n                  that are working with a secret government then the language is actually service to others versus\n                  service to self and that in itself is also a matter of degree so it is not really good anyone but you cannot judge see here\u2019s the\n                  problem well none of us can that is my whole point\n                  here well that is my whole point it is a matter of degree and i think before one starts going down the path\n                  of the sky is falling and we start unleashing this\n                  manichean  worldview of here\n                  are the ones that are service to others and here\u2019s the\n                  ones that are selfish i would say that there is\n                  some enlightened self-interest everywhere right and let us back this up just a little further let us say that these civilizations especially by the invaders by the who if there is an invasion race then enlightened self-interest is going to be the predominant\n                  model by which they are going to operate right and you know you are entitled to that i\n                  think you are i am positing all i am doing here look until it actually happens in black and white look where have they invaded who has been invaded and here\u2019s the there is evidence in other words you\n                  can get evidence on both sides of the question well but to characterize it as an invasion what\n                    if there is an interstellar group that have different different\n                    ones of them have different functions for example right okay i am going to take this a little further there is one group that has a very specific function you might call this the noah\u2019s ark function that this planet is under tremendous environmental stress we are losing thousands of species and plants and animals.i have spoken with people about the landing in provence of\n                  this et craft in a lavender field and there were these little\n                  ets out picking lavender it sounds hilarious what were they\n                  doing just like the movie yeah absolutely happened and it left physical trace could there be a human genome project that is trying to\n                  protect the human genome and a genome project for\n                  gaia the earth there could be all kinds of things going on that are beyond\n                  our ability to say that is happening by people who\n                  are selfish and invaders and that is happening\n                  by people who are the good ones exactly yes i think that that sort of dichotomy and dualism\n                  that i read on your blog is the exact script that majestic\n                  would want people to buy into to support interplanetary war i think that there is another yeah i think that the paranoia over interplanetary\n                  war per se and that scenario is laudable okay in a certain way we understand that you are coming from\n                  a heartfelt perspective when you talk about let us\n                  not get caught up in polarities okay but what we do not want to do is analyze this scene this scenario and the realities that are out there and say\n                  we have come to definitive statement where we can say there\n                  are only good ets.now let me tell you why that is dangerous as well because\n                  what that does is leave people humans and humanity possibly\n                  in general in a vulnerable position they are then going around\n                  following et like the pied piper down whatever road they are\n                  taken no i have always said and unfortunately you\n                  have not read my books and things but actually i have well i have made it very clear that there are two\n                  things that are equally dangerous \u2013 the deification of\n                  these visitors or the demonization of them exactly both are equally dangerous and i have said\n                  this since the \u201890s then we are in agreement but what you said\n                  on stage was not that i did not deify them and i did not demonize\n                  them my point is that we are living in a universe together we are going to have to live together in that universe absolutely the solutions are not going to be name-calling and we are\n                    better than you are and those are in service to\n                    self and those in service to others and this\n                    whole thing i think we have to look at this from a much larger picture and that is not only earth but the whole cosmos is going through\n                  a quantum moment right that is true it is not just an earth moment it is a universal\n                  moment okay the hallmark of which is universal peace the hallmark of which is that and so it is also true the ideal would be that interstellar civilizations are not allowed\n                  to leave their biosphere until they have become in agreement\n                  for peace now and that is an assumption this has been proven because if these civilizations no way nothing\u2019s been proven on this planet\n                  to that degree of sophistication there is no way well if they were here and they were invading and\n                  they were hostile they would not have waited for us to have\n                  the kind of weapons we have today they would have absolutely\n                  shut this civilization down in 1945 on the contrary i mean we have to actually get\n                  into a whole socio-political look at what it is to be an et\n                  space-faring culture in search of planetoids or planets and\n                  building new environments and then what you do with them in a sense you can actually take the earth as a microcosm\n                  and you can look at how did it go when we took over different\n                  continents here yeah but see this is the whole problem and what was the model then we\n                  get to space and we also have to figure this is a huge problem you are engaging in\n                  an anthropocentric projection onto interstellar civilizations as above so below in other words well so in your belief but i think that you are\n                  completely involved in this all i am saying is that we are part of\n                  the universe and you cannot eliminate and there is\n                  no definitive decision on this part you are making absolute\n                  statements do you think our classified projects have traveled\n                  interstellar yet yes absolutely they have not we have got evidence that they have well i had love to see you prove it we do not have evidence but in may 2001 you\n                  said that they have superluminal capability yes what have we done gone to pluto with superluminal\n                  ability it takes five seconds no because they are not allowed to use it now here\u2019s something that there is a quarantine\n                  on this planet until we become peaceful this is why if you\n                  look at there is a philosophy that there is\n                  a quarantine no there is if you look at even what\n                  neil armstrong said after why because an et told you i mean really let us\n                  get down to it we are all in communication with different\n                  races well let us get back to the cover-up with\n                  what neil armstrong was heard saying it is in timothy\n                  good\u2019s book above top secret you can read\n                  it yep and i am sure you have you have read it a mind-controlled astronaut is what you are\n                  talking about you are gonna give me testimony from a\n                  mind-controlled astronaut no no let us hear where this goes i am interested he said that when we were basically warned off\n                  the moon and that is why we did not continue to\n                  go and i believe these warnings exist there has been\n                  evidence that we are warned off mars because certain craft\n                  have never made it there have been shot down have disappeared have had technical problems that have not been explained\n                  by nasa well and one can put a xenophobic spin on that or one can say that perhaps there is a wiser cosmic order\n                  that says that until a civilization reaches a certain amount\n                  of civility for the civilization and peace they are not allowed\n                  to travel amongst the stars that the entry ticket is peace and i think that is the situation okay i understand that is your philosophy no it is not my philosophy it is what\n                  the evidence this is not how i started out this is\n                  what i have found to be true from many different witness testimonies\n                  and the observation overall and accurate but our witness testimony would contradict that so what do you do with that well fine i had like to speak to them yeah absolutely and maybe we will have to\n                  compare notes you know really to be honest with you this\n                  is valuable because what happens for better or for worse is we are both out there we are both investigating\n                  these questions and they are open questions actually the\n                  information has they are but i think it is rather unhelpful\n                  that you go onto a blog and say that what i am saying\n                  and doing is sinister but i said it was i think that you know i have never said anything\n                  harmful about you it is insidious the reason it is insidious\n                  is because insidious and this and that it leaves the earth vulnerable and i think this is exactly the kind of thing and\n                  i am going to absolutely you know you invited me to\n                  an interview sure i am going to provide an interview if you\n                  want to over-talk everything i say you can over-talk what\n                  i say you over-talk us but i am telling you that but i am\n                  being interviewed so the point is it is mutual see you do not\n                  know this and i am sorry we did not have time to\n                  tell you our philosophy of how we conduct an interview but\n                  i did kind of warn you you obviously want to have a debate that we have differences of opinions we have differences of opinion and that is\n                  fine but i think the most dangerous thing we can do is with see everyone has partial information right to start making sweeping judgments that are negative and you can say well it is not negative we are\n                  just saying that they are in service to self versus service\n                  to others and couch it however you wish but if we go down that path we are already creating\n                  a new cosmological us versus them which is the absolute\n                  recapitulation of the mistake on earth for the last 10,000\n                  years i think we can do better than that i think we have\n                  to learn to look at these things and let us say that everything that your philosophy and\n                  how you are viewing this is correct if it is a hundred\n                  percent correct i would still say the path of wisdom is education absolutely elucidation engagement peacefully higher\n                  states of consciousness \u2013 \u00a0all of this yep i do not think it consists in characterizations name-calling what have you now that goes on on the diplomatic\n                  front and between nations on the earth and i think we have\n                  to be very careful not to engage in that sort of anthropocentric\n                  projection of the current state of duality of the human condition\n                  on these visitors i think it may be much more difficult to\n                  make those kinds of assessments but if we go down that path what we will be doing is\n                  that we will be dragging the baggage of the old era into\n                  this pivotal time this embryonic time where we are trying\n                  to transition to a new civilization \u2013 the hallmark of\n                  which will be universal peace i do not think we are going to be going into a period\n                  of time of competing planetary systems having wars i think\n                  that this is \u2013 all of that \u2013 is the scientological\n                  view and it is many of the eschatologists view i think that actually we are going to go through a quantum\n                  transformation that is global and interplanetary that\n                  will make this quite clear in the coming years if not months i think that time is getting very short for how much more\n                  time we are going to have before there is this large\n                  transformation.and i think the other thing is to say i would say to people if\n                    there is a civilization that is here for their own purely\n                    selfish interest and have not a shred of altruism or concern\n                    for humanity or earth those are the beings i would want\n                    to meet with first and i have said this for years because you need a diplomatic\n                  initiative to north korea and iran and china more than you\n                  do to great britain if you are an american let us\n                  say so this is absolutely but you cannot be in denial of\n                  the potentiality there is no denial here i am not some\n                  sort of pollyanna fool and that characterization of me being\n                  in denial i am not in denial about anything i am\n                  just saying that well i wait wait wait you are personalizing\n                  this in a way that it is not personal in other words what i said is i did not direct it at you i said jan can give me what you wrote on the blog i will\n                  show you what you wrote on the blog excuse me i said that what you said on stage was insidious and it is insidious because what it does is leave again humanity look let us both agree here it is a real misdirect we both love it is a real misdirect it is a misdirect we both love humanity we are both here to\n                  make sure that we make it through this next era okay right and we can say we have a common goal in that sense absolutely when i say it is insidious i am not saying\n                  you personally are insidious what i am saying\n                  is what you are saying leads to an insidious state of\n                  affairs if people out there were to become disarmed and completely\n                  vulnerable and allow like i said et to take over \u201cthe\n                  sovereignty of the earth and of humanity to develop this is not at all i never suggested that to develop on its own but there are implications\n                  to what you are saying when you say all ets are good your implications about that when we are using the words good and bad let us be honest we are using the words good and bad because\n                  we have to use language and we are just using it in a\n                  simplistic way right to cover a very wide spectrum of what it\n                  means to be good philosophically and what it means to be\n                  bad philosophically we are not na\u00efve and we are\n                  not looking at this in a black and white way so let us\n                  not go there we have to be very careful because that slips into\n                  that very quickly that language slips into that paradigm very very quickly sure and it could be misleading i appreciate that and i think it is misleading but i think\n                  the other thing that it is also very dangerous i am\n                  not at all suggesting that humans disarm my whole message\n                  is about humans empowering not only in consciousness but\n                  in organization and every other way we agree and moreover you said that we need to be armed well yeah armed with what i think that knowledge that is the other discussion we can talk that is\n                  spiritual it is spiritual and this is the chief\n                  purpose of cseti knowledge is to question constantly what we are\n                  not positing is answers here so much as let us keep\n                  exploring and at no point do we decide that \u201call ets are good because\n                  suddenly we have a paradigm that says you cannot leave\n                  the planet beyond a certain point unless you believe in \u201cpeace and\n                  unless you have obtained a certain level of civilization that means that you are there for good all good and therefore\n                  better than humanity there is sort of an implication\n                  under there and your alternative would be what conflict with\n                  the ones who are not good no that is polarizing it in a way that we\n                  are not it is a model of universes multi dimensions that is more complex you are polarizing it what is your answer then my answer what is your answer to these ones that are\n                  in service to self it is complex it is more complex the ones that you see there are no limits go ahead okay my response to this is to agree with you that\n                  it is a very complex situation and there may be alien\n                  agendas that we are not able to understand just like the farmer\n                  can understand what the farmer\u2019s doing but not what\n                  the veterinary surgeon is doing you know if you approach a wild animal because you want to give it\n                  some food the wild animal\u2019s going to run away because\n                  it does not trust the human right there are all sorts of aspects to this that we may\n                  be very presumptuous in our ability to understand but my point\n                  is that it is dangerous and i am not\n                  even saying that it is a deliberate misdirect but i do\n                  believe it was personally i believe it was a misdirect to lead people to\n                  believe with the authority position that you have in the ufo\n                  community that if anybody feels that all that anything\n                  other than all ets are friendly then they are\n                  somehow working on the side of the illuminati that is a polarization that is not true we do not\n                  agree with that \u2013 at all we think that there is\n                  a big maybe category where for sure some\n                  ets are friendly absolutely i have met some of them personally right i do not even think that my abduction was ill-intended i think that this was a program in some way for something which i am doing now you may have had a parallel experience but i do not know what is happening i am\n                  willing to roll with that wave because i do not think\n                  they intended any harm to me but they sure as hell were not\n                  military that was not a milab operation no but my point is here\u2019s what i\n                  said but we do not know these things we\n                  do not know my point is that there is no evidence that\n                  these visitors are hostile sorry give me 20 seconds yeah actually there is but we do not know \u2013 hang on we do not\n                  know but neither do you and you should not\n                  say that you know and you do not that is my point well actually yeah let us get to the place where you know the fact is i am saying there is irresponsible because he does not know and you are presuming to know exactly and you are capitalizing on your authority\n                  position in the ufo community and that is irresponsible you are leading people who are feeding off your words and you should not do that you should be very no i am totally not irresponsible i am trying\n                  to do this very responsibly okay because i know what is at stake if\n                  people are led into the path of panic and polarity and duality but we are not doing that and this is absolutely the impression and you are giving the opposite impression saying do not worry about a damn thing no no and that is equally bad i am not saying do not worry i am saying let me tell you okay why not just enlighten awareness can i answer any of this do it go on it is too long i think you are answering\n                  it i think you have been answering but go ahead is that because no you have not heard my\n                  answer yet my answer is what i consistently say is that there is\n                  no evidence that they are hostile and that we have to\n                  be in an armed position in a star wars sdi position and that dealing with it in that way is the last thing that\n                  we should be doing i agree with that so whether or not let me finish wait a minute i cannot say that there is you cannot\n                  prove a negative i have said this three or four times i can go with the evidence i have seen moreover i can\n                  go with the experience of 19 years of thousands of people\n                  in cseti expeditions and experiences we have had with these\n                  visitors none of which has been fearsome negative invasive none of this sort.the other point that i have to make is that if it were true\n                  that there were civilizations that had self-interest and were\n                  going around the cosmos colonizing and invading different worlds\n                  or planetoids or what have you then i would say that those\n                  are the civilizations we need to find a way to engage and\n                  it is not going to be down the barrel of a laser weapon\n                  or an electromagnetic pulse weapon true i think you are making a jump i mean i have\n                  to say here let me finish i have not finished my answer you are making a jump to star wars from us\n                  just saying there may be ets with some self-interest guiding\n                  their paradigm well but let us take a step back from humanity\n                  for a moment and look at this through the eyes let us\n                  say there is a civilization like you are describing what civilization are we describing the ones that you think are not in service to others but in service to self we think they may have agendas that are not necessarily\n                  in our interest that is not a polarized position right right but let us say that is the case and it does not mean we want to shoot them\n                  in the head either okay but let us say that is true i do not\n                  think it is true but maybe i am wrong it is possible i mean i do not pretend to know everything maybe i am\n                  wrong but let us say that is true what might have instigated\n                  that now let us go back 100 years we are in horse-and-buggies\n                  and rifles and things my grandmother born in the late 1800\u2019s\n                  post-reconstruction south saw her son design the lunar module put the first man on the moon and now her grandson doing what\n                  i am doing we have gone from horse and buggies to the capacity for\n                  interstellar travel and antigrav and dematerialization and\n                  transdimensional technologies from gunpowder and the early\n                  stages of the industrial revolution at the same time we have\n                  gone from rifles and machine guns to thermonuclear weapons is it a coincidence that the sort of pandora\u2019s box that\n                  opened when we started detonating thermonuclear weapons was\n                  because it was having an effect beyond just the earth transdimensionally is it possible that the trajectory they saw our civilization\n                  going on these ones you think may not have our best interest\n                  in heart may have seen us going on a trajectory that if it\n                  continued on that trajectory would lead to us going into their\n                  neighborhood with weapons of mass destruction with our unchecked\n                  simian tendency towards war-making and what have you?so i am trying to say let us look at this for just\n                  a moment through another perspective that is non-human if we can it is very difficult because we are human i think i met robert solace he watched the craft fly over okay in montana the missile silos and turn them off i have\n                  talked with him in his house about these experiences as you\n                  have in your disclosure project right we are totally on the same page on that there is\n                  no doubt whatsoever that they came and they are absolutely\n                  adamant that this technology not go first of all not happen\n                  on the earth it would destroy the planet but second of all not go beyond it is\n                  actually interdimensional in its destructive ability correct yes i am very aware of this so i think we are in agreement on that in other words what kind of hornets nest did we\n                  pick and therefore what kind of provisions and things are\n                  going on as a consequence of that so i always say you know everyone starts getting into the oh this alien\n                    agenda and that alien agenda and i would say what\n                    would be more constructive is that the human agenda be fixed that we learn to live on this planet and fix no disagreement there fix our own home create a peaceful\n                    civilization rather than worrying about other motives from\n                    other civilizations here\u2019s what i predict i predict that if we were to\n                  do that and learn to live together without clubbing each other\n                  over the head and killing each other on this planet \u2013 as\n                  below so above \u2013 that we would see a change perhaps in the cosmic order for that reason.so rather than engaging in debates and speculation about\n                  the agenda perhaps harmful aliens and this and that i would\n                  say why do not we create a civilization of abundance and\n                  of peace and of enlightenment here and go into space with\n                  that intent and see what the response to the cosmos will be\n                  then it may be the response that we are getting now is a directly\n                  proportional response karmically and otherwise to what we\n                  have been doing to each other absolutely we are attracting like a mirror you know in the last 100 years we have killed 160-million of\n                  our own fellow humans i think that if you reflect on that and i was seeing an interview with robert mcnamara towards\n                  the end of his life where he was reflecting on the terrible\n                  mistakes he made in vietnam and the other wars of the 20th\n                  century what i think is that there needs to be a sort of let us\n                    look at ourselves and i think that many times but let us not do that to the exclusion it is\n                  not an either/or question in other words what i hear you\n                  saying is let us be a little more sort of earth-centered\n                  in our view of reality and not worry about the agendas of those\n                  other beings out there and let us concentrate on building\n                  our nest and making it a good healthy place and playing nice\n                  with each other there is no disagreement with that no it is not either/or i am saying let us\n                  do that that is why we are doing the orionproject.org we have absolutely no disagreement with that that is why we are also doing the contact diplomatic effort and we invite all these we always\n                  invite all these civilizations to make contact but actually you are assuming that there is\n                  no intervention going on and i think this is getting to the\n                  root of the question in other words do you know about screen\n                  memories you must know about them if you have been\n                  as deep as you have well yeah the psychotronic programs that have\n                  been in existence for many years all right because you obviously have a positive\n                  view of all your interaction and you know not to get personal\n                  on this level but to say that if i meet a being who thinks\n                  they have only had positive interactions with certain ets\n                  or animals or whoever they are then i might look at that person\n                  and i might question this is my issue \u2013 i might question whether or not that\n                  person really knows what they are having because they\n                  might be screen-memoried and they might actually be having\n                  some negative interaction in there and not know it now obviously\n                  i am not so you are back to the positive and the negative\n                  and the polarity but we live in a 3-d level and we are moving to\n                  the 4-d and see this is the whole point is that actually it goes beyond that so do not interrupt\n                  me because i want to finish here i do not think it is that simple absolutely and we agree on that it is very complex right we are multidimensional beings we live on\n                  lots of different levels we are spiritual beings first mm-hm and humans second okay we actually are\n                  just inhabiting these human bodies at the moment in my view okay correct short-term lease i have had a number of samadhi experiences myself so i totally know where you are coming from with that and i appreciate that but that does not change the fact\n                  that it is extremely complex this picture of what is\n                  going on here none of us have all the answers and to make definitive statements\n                  that we feel you are making out there \u2013 okay and\n                  to actually limit to put blinders on to such an effect to\n                  say there is nothing to be worried about at all humans\n                  out there just worry about your own little playground and\n                  meanwhile out there are because i got to tell you if you are aware of psychic\n                  and you have psychic perception you know there are entities\n                  that do not have bodies that are negatively oriented now \u201cnegative again becomes a judgment and\n                  how do you want to call negative those are not extraterrestrial now\n                  you are confusing the whole cosmological i am not confused on the contrary i am\n                  using an example i have never denied that there were those kind\n                  of entities okay fine but those are not extraterrestrial physical some\n                  of this may be definitional i know that let us extrapolate from there i am simply focusing right now on what you might term\n                  a \u201cnegative entity that does not have a body and i am saying or you could even say fire now fire is an entity it is\n                  a non it does not have a body and yet it has\n                  a power it can create itself so in a sense you could say\n                  it is negatively oriented if it burns your house but\n                  on the other hand it could keep you warm.so by the same token we could find entities that are in physical\n                  bodies \u2013 \u00a0again spirits having a physical experience \u2013 which\n                  could be an et it could be us it is so multidimensional do not you see what i am saying oh absolutely in other words if they are spirits as we are spirits then they can be moved by the positive polarity as they could\n                  be pulled by the negative polarity it could look from the dimension of being in this 3-d world\n                  that we are inhabiting called earth in this human body in this experience and how they impact us could in fact be\n                  ultimately negative to our growth cycle that is in fact something that has been posited as a very real possibility well anything is possible i mean obviously i\n                  just do not see the evidence for that i do see the evidence\n                  for humans killing each other i do see weapons in space where\n                  we have targeted these visitors i appreciate that and all of that so i mean we can talk\n                  in circles all day on this yeah sure my position is that there has not been an action\n                  against the earth and humanity from an extraterrestrial interstellar physical civilization to here that i think would cause us\n                  to want to have a sort of armed conflict response now are there experiences people have that they interpret\n                  as negative absolutely i am going to tell you something and people do not\n                  like to hear this but in a major trauma case if a child comes\n                  in and there is no time for anesthesia and i have to\n                  put a chest tube in the chest wall of that child i must look\n                  like the most horrible monster and devil that ever lived my motive is to save that child my motive\n                  is to help that child but to anyone seeing it who\n                  would just walk in from another planet or off the street they had\n                  go what is that monstrous doctor or what\n                  are they doing you are doing what you must and what my motive is is that i have\n                  got five minutes or less to save that child\u2019s life so all i am\n                  saying is that this sort of anthropocentric it is a matter of perspective and it is a matter of perspective i think\n                  that is why i prefer to be cautious cautiously optimistic put out a positive view on how we should be interacting with\n                  this thing it is not irresponsible i am not insidious i\n                  think that these sort of characterizations are highly offensive as i have never attacked you folks publicly i found i was attacked on your blog today it was unfortunate but my perspective i want to be very clear no no your philosophy was attacked you were\n                  not attacked yeah well whatever actually you were complimented but i just have to say that that is why we are\n                  wanting to be cautious because it is so easy for humans i\n                  mean look what happened after 9/11 it is so easy for humans\n                  to take shreds of information and then go on a war footing\n                  or go on a conflict footing we agree with you this is the inherent danger of some of the things\n                  that you are saying is it can shove humanity yeah okay i understand okay and there is one thing to have a private\n                  conversation about speculating about the motives and the agendas\n                  of the aliens but when you start talking to the people of\n                  the planet about this and you start putting out and\n                  positing that there are these \u2013 and to use your word and the polarity negative and this and that \u2013 this would throw\n                  the planet intoand it would also throw the planet completely into the camp\n                  of majestic who for years has been trying to and has also\n                  taken presidents aside like reagan and tried to convince\n                  them of exactly the argument you are making so that he\n                  would spend hundreds of billions of dollars on sdi i think\n                  this gets into serious policy issues yeah yeah okay and i have responsibilities here that you are\n                  not aware of so to say i am irresponsible you do not\n                  know what my responsibilities are and therefore i want to no you do not what i am saying here is that i want to ask a question which is very i\n                  want to take this back now just wait a second let us\n                  cool down and i want to just make an analogy now an analogy that i sometimes use and it\n                  usually results in nods of agreement is that we are like\n                  fishermen on a south sea island in the middle of the pacific\n                  ocean having believed for generations that we are the\n                  only people in the whole world we are sitting around a campfire cooking our fish and\n                  we are trying to figure out that big metal ship on\n                  the horizon what do they want with us that metal bird that\n                  keeps on circling around our island what are they doing is\n                  it real and did you see it and all this kind\n                  of stuff.we are trying to figure out the intentions assuming\n                  that we believe in their existence of these other beings that\n                  we are suddenly starting to realize might exist in our\n                  universe on this little tropical island now the problem is that if we really do look at this as a\n                  human situation which is quite real really what experience\n                  do we have as south sea island fishermen to figure out \u2013 maybe they want to cut our trees down maybe they want\n                    to save us because the sea level\u2019s rising and they\n                    want to take us to another island maybe they want our minerals or maybe they want to convert us to christianity maybe they\n                    want to eat us kill us or maybe they want to make friends how\n                    do we know the danger is \u2013 and this is a question now \u2013 the\n                  danger is that i am here around this campfire with you\n                  guys and i hear you saying those other men in those big ships\n                  and those metal birds must be friendly and i am saying wait a minute we need to be a little\n                    bit careful here because actually even though we do get\n                    into fights on this little island every now and then how\n                    do we know we can trust them maybe we can maybe we cannot what is your experience that is an attempt to characterize by analogy how complex\n                  this is that is why i said that it was irresponsible as i would do if i was around that campfire as an elder of\n                  this community saying they have got to be friendly we have got to trust them you have got to trust them this\n                  is what the incas said about the conquistadors yes but your metaphor is again an anthropocentric\n                  projection onto something that i think is non-applicable i think that in addition to that our i keep coming back\n                  to this not only in my personal experience but the experience\n                  of hundreds of people thousands of people that we have had\n                  involved with our diplomatic contact programs have not had\n                  any of this sort of experience that would lend us to believe\n                  that there are civilizations that are hostile to the earth\n                  and to humanity.on the other hand i have had many sources describe to me\n                  the programmed life forms the military involvement with hoaxing\n                  abductions a false-flag operation to create an alien threat\n                  that we can unite against so i have to go on the knowledge and the experience i have and it is not just observing something from afar because\n                  we have actually had contact we actually have more information\n                  than something just floating up above the island so the analogy\n                  breaks down very quickly and even if there was this potential for one or more of these\n                  planetary civilizations to be of concern to us my answer would\n                  still be the same:there needs to be engagement there needs to be a diplomatic\n                    d\u00e9tente there needs to be a rapprochement there\n                    needs to be an enlightened approach to this where we really\n                    move out of a sort of duality that leads to conflict on earth.i think that regardless of what your assessment of the agenda the path of wisdom and safety is that okay we do not disagree with that okay let us\n                  talk about where we agree i agree fully and it needs to be in the public\n                  domain i mean we certainly agree on the end objective okay the end objective from our point of view okay we are\n                  not part of the military-industrial complex okay we are doing what we do because we believe in truth because we are dedicating our lives and indeed our\n                  lives literally have been in danger because of what we believe we do it on a daily basis and you of all people should understand\n                  this mm-hm so we are not taking this lightly our end\n                  result is not to be what they may desire as their ultimate\n                  end-game in other words we are not here to support their\n                  end-game and we are not na\u00efve about what we are\n                  doing either so neither of those things is true okay we are not trying to promote sort of a fear-based paradigm\n                  such that people get into a place where the only thing they\n                  can think of is to shoot et in the head to be graphic or\n                  to allow for space-based weaponry.i mean we basically agree with your philosophy in that way wholeheartedly in fact i would say we are dedicating our\n                  lives to that however on the other hand we are also not going to sit here\n                  and pretend that we know all the answers and we are also\n                  not gonna assume that all contact is positive on the contrary\n                  to what your you are going to say whatever you think yeah obviously we are but in terms of this discussion\n                  and for the reason that we you know you are sort\n                  of saying our blog thing our posting you found offensive\n                  because we are saying what you are saying on stage and\n                  again you are on stage you are on stage actually\n                  more often than we are far more often \u2013 and i have to\n                  say therefore your responsibility is great.perhaps your approach is a bit simplistic in that you are\n                  assuming that if you talk about the potential that there are\n                  other things going on or a potential for other ways of looking\n                  at the question that the jump that the whole audience out\n                  there is gonna make immediately is to fear and panic and that\n                  they are gonna jump on this bandwagon of the military-industrial\n                  complex and all go out and grab their guns and knives and\n                  want to go shoot et and fight with each other and other worlds and so on that is not in other words you are\n                  going from but the problem is is that i am completely\n                  aware that my position is the minority position okay i am\n                  acutely aware that actually that is not true either i mean there are plenty of people out there that are advocating peace\n                  and love and getting on their cars and jumping up and down please et come save us because you are all good no i would actually challenge you to look at hollywood the ufo community the books and videos that are out on this\n                  subject they are overwhelmingly negative and terrifying i think\n                  that this is one of the problems i do not think so i think that one of the problems is that we have\n                  to look at this with a long view and the long view as i see\n                  it and this is all i can do is go by my own moral compass\n                  and what i think is right i do not think i am irresponsible i do not think i am simplistic and all these sort\n                  of characterizations i think that i have a responsibility to help articulate a\n                  path forward that is wise and that does not redound to further\n                  fear and panic and negativity on this planet but that moves\n                  us forward in a positive way and that can lead to what i am\n                  certain will be the future for this planet.that is one of not only world peace but universal peace\n                  and a wholly completely new transformative civilization on\n                  this planet that is not thousands of years off or even\n                  decades off now i think it is very very near so i think that that is what i wish to articulate there is\n                  no simplicity to it it is actually a rather complex concept it is also a way of engaging spiritually.i want to share a dream i had i do not share this very\n                  often but back when my friend shari and i and another member\n                  of my team all got metastatic cancer in the same month and\n                  we were all going to die she died but she was still alive and bill colby had died been killed trying to help us just\n                  before this it was a terrible time actually for me.i had a dream and of course i am human i was angry i was mad as hell at what was happening to us i had a dream \u2013 i think i was in england doing some\n                  crop circle work \u2013 and in the dream there were these\n                  giant lions that were stalking me they were going to try to\n                  kill me it is funny because dr tom bearden talks about \u201cthe\n                  lions of this cabal and i had never heard him use\n                  that term at the time i had the dream but here were these huge lions and they were stalking me\n                  and they were going to kill me and it was this lucid lucid full-color dream i did not run i did not get angry i did not\n                  have hate in my heart i opened my heart and went to a place\n                  of universal love and consciousness and i engaged each lion\n                  in their eyes we were doing this following each other around and eventually\n                  they became so engaged with that energy that even though they\n                  had huge claws and fangs they actually flipped over on their\n                  back and i was petting them like this like they were big pussycats we had become it completely diffused that situation.i use that as an analogy of sort of an aikido spiritually of the engagement i am endeavoring in both with the public with majestic with the visitors that is what i am\n                  doing i understand that is it in summary i think that is a great description of your\n                  approach and what is motivating you thank you very much\n                  for that steven greer thank you for sharing that steven thank you thank you very much we appreciate it thank you click\n                  here for the\n                  video\n \u00a0ruth huber (translator i think so we can start bill all right is there anyone else\n                  to come in the room here all right so everybody welcome to the conference we are\n                  delighted that you are here and that you have made the\n                  journey from wherever it is you have come from the first thing i want to do - i think you all know who i\n                  am bill ryan from project camelot but a member of the swiss\n                  ground crew i am very very proud to be part of this\n                  team there is something very important to say here about that and i do thank you for giving that spontaneous applause to\n                  this team this is not a professional conference in english the opposite of professional is \u201camateur for\n                  those of you who know latin know that the word amateur means people\n                  who love what they do we are not doing this for money do not\n                  ever organize a conference for money it is not going\n                  to work but you might just want to organize a conference because\n                  you love doing it and i would highly recommend that actually before i start talking about the\n                  history of this conference i want to introduce my alter ego this\n                  is ruth huber ruth is one of the most important people here not only because she is played a huge role in bringing\n                  this conference together but also because she is one\n                  of the key translators i am trying to embarrass her okay some people have understandably thought that this was a project\n                  camelot conference it is not a project camelot conference it is a swiss ground crew conference we have been receiving emails from all over the world and in a moment we will go through what countries you\n                  all are from because a lot of people have traveled a long way a lot of people write to us and they say hey i am\n                    part of the dutch ground crew or the german ground\n                    crew or the spanish ground crew it is\n                    important to realize that the word ground crew the phrase \u201cground crew actually came from george\n                    green george green is not here but he actually has played quite\n                  a big part in this conference although his role is sort of\n                  invisible this conference actually started just before we went \u2013 that\n                  is when i say \u201cwe i mean kerry cassidy and myself\n                  from project camelot \u2013 went to ecuador in january of\n                  this year and one of the swiss team here who is somewhere\n                  in the audience \u2013 i dare not identify her because she is\n                  got a lot to answer for ruth i did not get that bill you did not get that one of the\n                  swiss team here before we went to ecuador - and she is\n                  in the audience here i am not going to identify her but everything that is happening here is all her fault\n                   \u2013 said to me when you see george green\n                  in ecuador can you invite him back to switzerland because\n                  we would love to have him here now george green had all kinds of other plans and he is\n                  a busy man and he was not able to come to switzerland\n                  this summer but when we were talking with brian o\u2019leary \u2013 dr brian o\u2019leary he is here in the front row you will\n                  be hearing from him on sunday and also tomorrow evening brian o\u2019leary is a very wonderful man and it is\n                  my privilege i think to be able to call him a good friend he said hey i will come to europe i climbed the\n                  matterhorn when i was a young man i had love to see it\n                  again so we had this idea of this little group of people and we had\n                  have brian maybe in this little room and we had share\n                  some coffee together and he had tell some stories to us and then someone else who is also in this room and who\n                  we should not identify said you know what it would\n                  be really wonderful to invite dan burisch to switzerland i said there is absolutely no chance of that happening that\u2019ll never happen then i had an afterthought and i thought well i could just send a mail it is\n                    very easy to send a mail and he said okay i will come to zurich no\n                    problem i do not know whether dan is in this room right now i think he is coming later is dan here no no he is\n                  not dan\u2019s coming later because he is still on american\n                  pacific time which means that he is just sort of starting\n                  to feel like it is breakfast that is\n                  why he is on this evening i know that an awful lot of you have come here specifically\n                  to hear his story and i will say a little bit more about\n                  that in the next hour or so because i want to give dan as much\n                  of an introduction as i can because it is a very complicated\n                  story then what happened was that we had brian and we had dan then dan said hey i want marci to come then people\n                  were saying well you can stand up and talk to some people too and then suddenly we had a conference we invited david wilcock he is never been to europe\n                  before so this is really quite a special event yesterday evening for quite a long time late into the night\n                   dan marci david and myself  had a two hour video conversation which was so interesting that we practically had to drag david\n                  and dan out of their seats at midnight because it could have\n                  gone on until daylight that was the first time the four of\n                  us have actually been in the same place to talk about a lot\n                  of this material together and that is been recorded on\n                  video and that will be released as soon as possible it is\n                  interesting stuff now before i dive into this interesting stuff i just want\n                  to acknowledge the people who have taken up a lot of time spent quite a bit of money and demonstrated a huge amount of\n                  commitment to be here this weekend we have people here from\n                  25 different countries i just want to read these out to you\n                  because it is quite impressive every time i look at this\n                  list i am impressed it is a list in alphabetical order i am not going\n                  to embarrass you but i do invite you that if i read out your\n                  country i would love you to raise your hand so we can actually\n                  see that you are here i will not ask you to stand\n                  up or tell us what your real name is or anything like that and all of you agents in this audience we hope\n                  you have fun and it is all cool we hope you\n                  have a good time because this is in alphabetical order who is come here\n                  from australia ruth ah bill is not that amazing that blew me away these\n                  are not rich people but they are committed people they\n                  have a different kind of wealth so we will not talk about cricket okay okay and you do not have to give each other rounds of\n                  applause because that all wastes a lot of energy but austria\n                  is the next one all right good belgium all right canada who is from\n                  canada we know we have got a couple people from canada maybe you are shy or maybe you are late but you have\n                  paid croatia okay wonderful the czech republic denmark okay ecuador ruth hey bill france great britain a lot of people from germany i think israel italy luxembourg malta we have got\n                  a large contingent from the netherlands ruth wow bill it is a small country full of very smart\n                  people just like the swiss okay norway poland portugal slovakia slovenia spain sweden switzerland alright ruth it feels like the eurovision song contest bill eurovision song contest absolutely yes and the usa we were going to have somebody\n                  in america actually living in china he was going to come some strange things have happened to some of the people who have\n                  been intending to come to this conference now we are\n                  not going to ask anyone to share any details here but i bet\n                  that there are some people here who had to overcome some last-minute\n                  problems to get here the guy from china could not make it because his son\n                  had been kidnapped by his ex-wife we hope that nothing like\n                  that happened to you guys but we have had our fair share\n                  of interesting incidents ruth oh yeah bill okay george green coined this phrase \u201cthe\n                  ground crew and there is a wonderful little book\n                   it is a free ebook  which is available on his website actually it is a series of four books and the fourth\n                  book is called messages for the ground crew i highly\n                  recommend that you read this it is a little book that george tells a very interesting\n                  story that it is basically a channeled book he did not\n                  write it it just came through his fingers this was a message\n                  basically from a group who he identified as the pleiadians the message in this book was that we may not have a lot of\n                  time to fix things up here that the earth is in trouble the\n                  human race is in trouble the story does not have to have an unhappy ending but\n                  there is quite a lot of work to do and someone\u2019s\n                  got to do it this book this little book the messages\n                  for the ground crew was like a calling to people who\n                  considered themselves to be the people who were going to do\n                  the work if nobody else did it is a very interesting situation because i am\n                  quite sure that a lot of people in this room  maybe everyone\n                  in this room  you might not actually consider yourself to\n                  be a totally normal human being now i am not going to ask you to hold up your hands\n                  and admit to being really strange but i will try the opposite is anyone willing to hold up their hand and think that they are\n                  really normal we have two people maybe you are\n                  in the wrong conference i am quite sure that there are a lot of people here who\n                  believe or who know or have recalled or are recalling that\n                  they are here this lifetime for a purpose my friend and\n                  colleague kerry cassidy is organizing a conference in los\n                  angeles in september and the title of that conference is awake\n                  and aware that was her idea and it is a pretty\n                  good title i wish i had thought of it but there are a lot of people here who are awake and aware two weekends ago we had the great pleasure and privilege \u2013 it\n                  was an extraordinary weekend actually \u2013 of meeting somebody\n                  called dr pete peterson i will say a little bit about\n                  that here then more in my workshop on sunday morning one of the many things that pete peterson told us was that as far as his research had led him to understand 15 percent\n                  of humans had extraterrestrial dna that could be directly identified the same man told us because of some things that he has a\n                  lot of experience of in his career that those same fifteen\n                  percent are resistant to being mind controlled the implications of this are very very interesting it implies\n                  that it may be quite hard to wake up 85 percent of the population this is across all races and nationalities but the 15 percent\n                  are waking up and i think that everyone in this room is going\n                  to be part of that group as i kind of put these pieces together this\n                  is really what this grouping called the ground crew are or may be it is not just a grass roots movement to\n                  ruth] do you know what i mean by 'grass roots ruth not really bill not just in the public it is not just a\n                  public movement by the person in the street the ordinary person there are people on the inside there are people on the inside\n                  of the military of the intelligence services even in politics military intelligence and politics and these are good guys\n                  as well there are quite a lot of them we have met some\n                  of them and they are doing what they can from the inside\n                  to change things what this conference is about \u2013 well let me start that\n                  sentence again one of the things this conference is about it is helping to form what rupert sheldrake called a morphic\n                  field or to change the metaphor we are trying to create a\n                  wave or we are trying to get a snowball rolling and\n                  we are not alone in here because we know that a lot of\n                  you guys are doing everything that you can in your own countries in your own ways there is a real movement here there is a real awakening a lot of people becoming more aware a lot of people are talking\n                  about it almost all of you will be on the internet a lot and\n                  it is being talked about and this is a real phenomenon david icke is talking about it david icke was one of the\n                  first people to really start shaking people awake back in the\n                  early 1990s in the early 1990s david icke was talking about what david\n                  wilcock calls illuminati politics he felt that his\n                  mission was to talk about a lot of startling and incredible\n                  information about what really is happening in the world we\n                  had the privilege of talking with him in february of this year personally and what he wanted to talk about then was the role\n                  of consciousness and this is really the theme of this conference although\n                  there is a lot of interesting stuff that we can talk about we can talk about illuminati politics and we can talk about\n                  high technology too there is a lot of very interesting\n                  stuff we may have somebody in this room who is been off-planet for example and i am not going to ask them to raise their\n                  hand unless they want to it is not him there is a lot of \u2013 in english we use the euphemism \u2013 there\u2019re\n                  a lot of sexy things we could talk about but what\n                  we really want to talk about is the important stuff and the\n                  important stuff is how we can all work together to create a\n                  better world hence the title of this conference which is a new world if you can take it and i did not think of that\n                    title either some of you probably know that this came from\n                    colonel philip corso he is now passed on but he wrote\n                    a very significant book called the day after roswell the story of how that phrase came into prominence is best\n                  told by his son what his son explained was that in 1957 his father was in\n                  white sands missile base in new mexico he encountered a disc\n                  and a being in the desert it was sitting there in the desert\n                  and it was sort of phasing in and out of his field of vision it was a very strange phenomenon he was very shocked and as he looked at this being this\n                  being contacted him telepathically the being asked him if\n                  he could go back to the central operations base at white sands\n                  and turn off the radar as many of you may know there is\n                  a lot of evidence that one of the reasons why the discs crashed\n                  in the late 1940s and early 1950s was because of the high-powered\n                  radar that was being used so this little et asked philip corso to turn off the radar\n                  so that he could get out of here and go and philip corso asked\n                  the question well if i help you what is \u2013 in\n                  english we say \u2013 what is in it for me what\n                  do i get out of this this little extraterrestrial - or whatever he was - said a\n                    new world if you can take it so this phrase did not come from a human being or if\n                  it was a time traveler it did not come from a human being\n                  from this time one of the reasons why i love this phrase \u2013 a new world if you can take it \u2013 is that in english it has a double\n                  meaning in english it can mean two things it can mean a\n                  new world if you can handle it and the other meaning\n                  is it is a new world that is there for you to\n                  take it if you want to like reaching up for something on a high shelf in a supermarket you can take it in other words it is available if\n                  we want it this also is what this conference is about because it is\n                  about what kind of future is waiting for us and even that\n                  is not an accurate use of words the really accurate way\n                  of putting it is what future will we create for ourselves we get into all kinds of paradoxes here because there is strong\n                  evidence - and you will hear much more about this this evening\n                  when we hear from dan burisch - the strong evidence that we\n                  have been visited by future humans human beings from the future\n                  who have returned to try and help and give us some valuable\n                  information even that is not a proper use of words because just now i\n                  said they are from the future but more accurate\n                  would be to say they are from \u201ca future there is a lot of evidence that we have a choice of futures there are alternative futures there are different ways in\n                  which this whole virtual reality game which we are in this movie which we are all playing in could actually\n                  end it does not actually end but we get the idea another metaphor would be it is like which path do\n                  we want to take and one of the things that dan is going to\n                  talk about this evening with marci mcdowell is how it may be\n                  that there is good news there is encouraging news about the\n                  fact that maybe things are not going to be as bad as\n                  we thought now this is incredible information when i say incredible i mean it in the literal meaning of the word it is \u201cnot\n                  believable we know that this information is hard to believe we know\n                  that dan burisch is hard to believe we have people writing\n                  to us every day saying that dan burisch is hard to believe\n                  and i agree with them but there is something very important\n                  here that we ask you and that is that if you are in doubt\n                  about this story we ask you to suspend your disbelief we\n                  ask you not to disbelieve until you hear the evidence i have spent a lot of time with this man it is been\n                  a great privilege for me to do so the most recent time i spent\n                  with him was several hours in a car yesterday we went off\n                  to look at the swiss countryside and we ended up having another\n                  conversation about his experiences and he talked about them\n                  in great detail on the video that we recorded with david wilcock\n                  late last night i will stake my reputation on the fact that\n                  this man is telling the truth david wilcock - who many of you have also come here specifically\n                  to hear - has also been in close touch with dan since 2003 david is sure that this story is true from my personal point of view the story goes right back\n                  to the beginning of project camelot just over three years\n                  ago it feels like a very long time ago but i guess it really\n                  is not a long time compared with the many years that many\n                  ufo researchers have been working i had only just met kerry and we just had this wild idea that\n                  we could assist and continue the work of the disclosure project which we admired just by talking to people and helping them\n                  get the information out about what they had experienced because like many of you i am sure both kerry and i\n                  had been inspired by the work of steven greer when he brought\n                  out a number of witnesses to the washington press club conference i think it was in may of 2001 we admire the work of steven greer we have never met\n                  him but we are both going to be at the exopolitics conference\n                  in spain which is in a couple of weekends time and we have\n                  an arrangement to talk to steven greer then which will be\n                  a lot of fun anyway in those days just like many of you \u2013 you have\n                  got blogs you have got web sites some of you are journalists you are doing everything you can do to try to get this\n                  information out this is a big team effort all over the world we just picked up this little camcorder that kerry had - you\n                  could fit it in your pocket it was tiny - and we just started\n                  talking to people we were amateurs in fact i will tell you a joke about this which is really\n                  true one of the favorite messages that i ever got in an email\n                  was from somebody last year who wrote to me and said you\n                  know for many months i thought that you must be working for\n                  the cia then he said i finally realized that you\n                  could not be otherwise your videos would be a lot more\n                  professional i took that as a compliment i thought it was very funny it is what kerry cassidy calls guerilla film making so we were just doing our thing and we had the opportunity \u2013 it is\n                  a wonderful opportunity \u2013 to meet dan burisch and we\n                  were introduced by bill hamilton we were as enthusiastic to\n                  meet dan as probably many of you are and we know this is why\n                  you are here i personally have been interested in his story since 2002\n                  and when we met dan for the very first time within ten minutes i realized that this was an exceptional man he was smart he was humble he was funny he was aware and he was completely\n                  committed to doing the job that he had been told to\n                  do of releasing this information one of the things that he is going to do this evening when\n                  he is presenting on this platform is he will play you\n                  the recording of when he was given his orders to release this\n                  information because what dan is doing is actually part of\n                  an unofficial \u2013 no let me say this again \u2013 it is\n                  part of an official disclosure program with built-in plausible\n                  deniability ruth will you explain this a little more bill absolutely he was ordered to tell this unbelievable\n                  story of everything that he knew and everything that he experienced the person who ordered him was the previous mj-1 in the majestic\n                  12 group and this is john mike mcconnell who after he stepped\n                  down from that role in majestic became the director of national\n                  intelligence in the u.s the dni in other words he is\n                  the guy who is the boss of the head of the nsa he is\n                  the top dog dan will say a lot more this evening about mike mcconnell\n                  and his relationship with mike mcconnell the unenviable position\n                  that dan is in is that if we were to go and find mike mcconnell\n                  and say well what do you think of this story he\n                  would say this man is obviously crazy so they are using dan to disseminate this information\n                  into i guess those 15 percent of people who are awake and\n                  aware dan will tell you this evening what a tough job that\n                  has been and he will tell you about his reaction when\n                  he first received those orders which were in october 2005 and then along came project camelot ruth will you tell about this reaction now bill no that is for dan i mean that is\n                  dan\u2019s story i am just preparing the ground but along came project camelot we had no idea what\n                  we were getting ourselves into but after meeting dan it was\n                  so obvious to us that this man had high integrity and the best\n                  of intentions that we then became an unknowing part of this unofficial disclosure\n                  movement when i asked dan \u2013 ah this is really quite funny we\n                  met dan for dinner kerry cassidy and myself at the beginning\n                  of last year about 18 months ago and i said to him you\n                  know it is amazing because we are hiding out in\n                  the open everyone knows who i am i make it obvious who i\n                  am everyone knows my name i do not try and hide if the intelligence agencies wanted to stop what we were doing they could do it really easily every now and then we get a\n                  little bit of trouble but basically we are being allowed\n                  to do what we do i am not really claiming anything too special here because\n                  those of you with blogs and web sites and those of you who\n                  are journalists and film makers here in this room no one\u2019s\n                  really trying to stop you either not really they could really have just squashed us like flies if they had\n                  wanted to and they have not done that so i asked dan i said is it possible that mike mcconnell in his role\n                  of director of national intelligence could be protecting us dan fixed me with a very twinkling eye \u2013 dan has a very\n                  expressive face \u2013 and he said if he was you would\n                  never know about it would you so that is my answer \u2013 he answered my question \u2013 that\n                  we are being allowed to do what we do because the governments\n                  and the intelligence agencies and the military of this world\n                   they have a problem as we say in english they are\n                  in over their heads they have a huge problem many of you\n                  will know how they have been trying to handle this problem\n                  for many many years to get this information out without causing\n                  social disruption panic or too much personal shock for people a couple of years ago i had a very interesting conversation\n                  with dr hal puthoff the famous physicist the director of\n                  the institute of advanced studies in austin texas it is\n                  one of my personal goals to interview him on project camelot by the way it was hal who explained to me \u2013 and he is a very\n                  intelligent guy he is a very nice guy i am privileged\n                  to count him as a friend as well \u2013 and he said that what is\n                  important  and he was sort of giving me advice rather like\n                  an uncle  he said do not try and prove anything because if you come out with documents and photographs things\n                  that cannot be denied then people will go into shock because\n                  their reality will be challenged if all we are doing is we are telling crazy stories\n                  about time travel and future humans and all this wild high\n                  technology but we cannot prove anything then the 15\n                  percent of the awake and aware people will say okay i\n                  thought it was like that and thanks for confirming it and\n                  the others guys will say we are all crazy and\n                  they will carry on watching tv and going to church on\n                  sunday morning so one of the factors in project camelot that has enabled\n                  us to continue operating is that we do not present proof we do not have any proof but what we do have is a lot\n                  of consistent stories and after we met dan burisch in - i\n                  think it was july i think it was this month in 2006 i actually cannot remember \u2013 and we got on video\n                  this wild story and for those of you who are still not\n                  quite clear about this story i will just give you the summary\n                  version right now that story is that at least some of the so-called extraterrestrials\n                  are actually not just visitors from other planets but they\n                  are time travelers from other times not only are they visitors\n                  from other times but they are human beings from\n                  a future time from several different times in the future but all on this same timeline a whole variety of very strange things happened that caused\n                  a huge amount of complexity and entanglement of the timeline but the essence of what the future humans wanted to communicate\n                  was that in their history there was a catastrophe it happened\n                  round about now and the cause of this catastrophe was connected\n                  with the passage of the solar system through a region of energized\n                  space again this is condensed and not intended to be fully technically\n                  accurate because the realities are very complicated but one\n                  of the secret high-tech devices that some of the governments\n                  in the world had was called the looking glass the\n                  looking glass is a way of gathering information from different\n                  times it is a sort of portal it is a window you\n                  can look through it or into it and you can retrieve information\n                  from the future to make that story even more incredible this was not\n                  given to us by visiting extraterrestrials this was back-engineered\n                  from sumerian cylinder seals anyone who knows about the work\n                  of zecharia sitchin will understand that the sumerians received\n                  their civilization and their technical knowledge from the anunnaki so as i understand it the looking glass is anunnaki technology which is being used by the american government as a really\n                  useful way of looking ahead to see what was going to happen\n                   with all the attendant paradoxes and complexities that went\n                  along with that one of the things that dan told us was that many politicians\n                  - not just american politicians - had been told what had been\n                  seen for them in the future and as long as they liked what\n                  they saw then they just acted out the role just like actors\n                  in a movie because they knew what it was that they were meant\n                  to be doing something that dan said that added further complexity to this\n                  story was that the roswell crash was also a visit from time-traveling\n                  future humans and that that was a genuine accident one of\n                  the immediate problems that resulted from that was that in\n                  the late 1940s the americans were experimenting with time-travel\n                  technology that they did not understand if you start experimenting\n                  with technology like that and you do not know what you are\n                  doing you are going to get yourself in a real mess a part of that is something that david wilcock who is\n                  just joined us in this room \u2013 david nice to see you\n                   \u2013 david\u2019s talking for much of the day\n                  tomorrow and one of the things that he may or may not refer\n                  to is that a number of years ago he was sitting in a restaurant occupying himself by reading one of peter moon\u2019s books\n                  about the montauk project at that time david thought that the montauk project was a\n                  pretty crazy story and was very unlikely to be true and this\n                  other guy was over at this other table in this restaurant and\n                  saw him reading the book he came over to david and said do\n                  you mind if i join you he said what do you think\n                  of that book david said it is a crazy story i have got nothing else to read right now if i am misrepresenting this story david i apologize but this is the essence of it david wilcock i actually told him\n                  it was bullshit bill david does not pull any punches this guy\n                  came over to david and said well actually maybe it is\n                  not just bullshit because i can tell you some things about\n                  this story this was somebody who david then got to know over a period\n                  of quite a long time really very well and he called him daniel which is not his real name daniel said that at least the first\n                  of peter moon\u2019s series of montauk books was essentially\n                  quite true and david\u2019s a pretty smart guy so actually he started listening but he never published any of that information he kept it to himself this is where these different testimonies start to come together because after we had personally heard this story from dan\n                  burisch we then met a guy who we have given the pseudonym\n                  to of henry deacon many people think that these people we bump into that somehow they have been planted or it is all been engineered or it is all been choreographed in some way but rather\n                  like david meeting daniel in the restaurant our meeting henry\n                  really was quite an accident when kerry and i met henry for the first time it was in a\n                  very noisy pizza hut the first thing henry did was he took\n                  out his cell phone put it on the table and took out the battery because cell phones can be used as listening devices even\n                  if they are turned off and henry started talking about\n                  an enormous amount of fascinating information that included\n                  the mention of time travel and montauk now i am english and i am not quite so expressive\n                  as david is so i did not actually use the word bullshit but i was very surprised and i said are you saying that\n                  the montauk project is real henry said that we should not call it the montauk\n                    project there were montauk projects \u2013 in the\n                    plural \u2013 and that the americans have been messing around\n                    with time-travel technology for many many years and had\n                    created all kinds of paradoxes and problems and every time\n                    they tried to fix it they made it worse i asked henry if he had heard of dan burisch\u2019s story because i immediately thought that there must be a correlation\n                  here and henry had not heard of dan so we said well look this sounds like the same sort of stuff watch our video and\n                  do get back to us because we had love to know what you\n                  think three weeks later henry got back to us and he said i\n                    can confirm dan burisch\u2019s story timelines and all that really made us sit up and take notice of this stuff intuitively we had strongly felt that this was the heart of\n                  the problem but it was very valuable to have this coming at\n                  us from two different sources who we had met and spent\n                  time with personally after we published this information from henry on our web\n                  site then david wilcock contacted us and we had not\n                  previously been in contact with him at all david said this\n                  information is really important because it is the first\n                  confirmation i have heard of what my source daniel told me which i have never published then we met david and we did an interview with him ruth that was the first meeting with david bill yes that was the first meeting with david david told us a lot of the stuff that daniel had shared with\n                  him during the time that they had spent together therefore what i want to say is like an adapted version of\n                  something that bill cooper said \u2013 william cooper very\n                  well known to many of you  he said this back at the end of\n                  the 1980s what bill cooper said in a very famous lecture which is still available on the internet he said you\n                  cannot make sense of geopolitics in the world without including\n                  the ufo/extraterrestrial issue he said you have\n                  to understand that stuff and accept its reality in order to\n                  understand what is happening in the world i can take that one step further because you cannot\n                  make sense of the ufo/extraterrestrial question without accepting\n                  and taking into account time travel it is deeply connected\n                  with many of the problems that we currently face and while\n                  talking about the technicalities of time travel and all of\n                  the extraordinary stories \u2013 this is not what i am\n                  planning to do here and it is not actually what this conference\n                  is about \u2013 we cannot talk about the future without\n                  talking about time over and over and over again there are hundreds  if not\n                  tens of thousands  of accounts from people who have had contact\n                  with ets saying that there is a very important time for\n                  us all \u2018round about now some of these \u2013 let me\n                  call them visitors \u2013 some of these visitors\n                  have said to the people that they have been communicating\n                  with you are in a lot of trouble not them personally\n                   they are talking about the human race some of them have talked about some pretty unpleasant possibilities\n                  that might be in front of us like warnings others have said\n                  that there is the possibility of a golden wonderful future\n                  for the human race and one of the things that this conference\n                  is about it is about presenting this is a choice\n                  for all of us one of the things that i had like to play just before\n                  the break which is happening in five minutes \u2013 do we\n                  have intention to play the audio in a moment - only when i\n                  say play - i want to play an audio clip that is\n                  a one-minute audio clip it is nothing especially secret but it is very interesting and important in my personal\n                  view this is an audio clip of bill birnes this was before he became\n                  famous on ufo hunters but bill birnes is the editor\n                  of the american ufo magazine he is done a lot\n                  of research for many many years was the person who worked\n                  with colonel philip corso to write the book the day after\n                  roswell he was on the american radio program coast to coast am talking\n                  to george noory and george noory was asking bill birnes about\n                  the roswell crash what you will hear \u2013 i am not\n                  going to translate what he says this is why i am giving\n                  you the overview here through ruth \u2013 he said that he\n                  had spent some time talking with admiral george hoover from\n                  the office of naval intelligence and george hoover had told\n                  bill birnes that the roswell visitors were time-travelers the biggest secret was not the high technology that was\n                  discovered the biggest secret was not that these guys\n                  came from a future time the biggest secret was that in order\n                  for this time-travel to be possible the visitors had to interface\n                  with their craft with their consciousness that the real meaning\n                  for us in this was that we were more able and our consciousness\n                  was greater than we had ever been permitted to understand that the controllers of this planet do not want you to\n                  know how powerful you are because they had be in big trouble\n                  if everyone knew how powerful they were that is why they lie to us all the time to try and convince\n                  us that we are not powerful we are just coming up to the break and before the break\n                  i just want to play \u2013 this is the clip george noory what we do not  about the\n                    situation at roswell is whether these were extraterrestrial whether they came from a hollow earth whether they came\n                    from another dimension we do not know this right bill birnes we do not the only clue that\n                    i had was from this naval officer he was from the office\n                    of naval intelligence \u2013 oni \u2013 called george hoover\n                    (we have talked about him before who said that he was the\n                    corso of the navy [ed note reference to\n                    col philip corso the author of \u2018the day after roswell and\n                    that the military believed and he said he knew that these\n                    entities were not so much interplanetary but they were literally\n                    time-travelers and the big secret is that they were us from the future and that we and they have the same powers and that was the\n                    real fear of the government that we had the ability to manipulate\n                    reality around us we have always had that ability we\n                    just did not know how to use it and if we ever learned\n                    how to use it  and were not ready for it  we would cause\n                    chaos and that was the big secret that the navy eventually\n                    found out bill thank you so one of the things that i want to\n                  pass on to my colleagues \u2013 first dan and then david who is to be talking about these and closely connected\n                  subjects all tomorrow \u2013 is how powerful we are and what\n                  opportunity we have to in bill birnes\u2019s words to\n                  manipulate reality around us manipulate is like a strong word to use but what\n                  he is talking about is creating reality what reality\n                  we want to create and what are the opportunities are before\n                  us \u2013 this is what this conference is about so now we will take a break and we will be back here\n                  at half-past three and then i will be talking for one more\n                  hour until half past four and then we have a two-hour break\n                  after that bill all right very good thank you i have\n                  got a couple of announcements here just minor administrative\n                  ones one is just a reminder that in the little snack bar opposite\n                  here which is timed to be open during the breaks there actually\n                  is hot food there if you need it or want it another little plug here for the girls at the help desk they\n                  are more than happy to help you with any problems that you have\n                  got including finding a hotel answering questions about how\n                  to find out information and so on please use them and we have a couple of badges that we need to give to heinrich\n                  schnorf and somebody who prefers to be known only as melvin okay so just a reminder of the timing here i am going\n                  to talk for an hour and then we have a break until six-thirty then at six-thirty dan and marcie are going to come in and\n                  we are going to be having a conversational presentation i am going to kind of be talking with them about their\n                  material i would love to know if dan and marcie are in the room are\n                  they here no okay they are still on los angeles time okay so in this next hour i am going to\n                  continue to prepare the ground for the main presentations by\n                  the other speakers earlier i was talking about the testimony that dan burisch\n                  has been ordered to report about which is that the time-traveling\n                  future humans were warning of a catastrophe \u2018round about\n                  now i think i had not quite finished off telling the\n                  story of the significance of the looking glass devices one of the problems in telling these stories is that they\n                  do not go in a straight line everything you talk about\n                  leads to at least two or three other subjects therefore it is\n                  very hard to explore all this ground in a kind of linear way the significance of the looking glasses which if you remember i was explaining that they were back-engineered from anunnaki\n                  technology through the sumerian cylinder seals and was part\n                  of the creation of this huge tangle which has got to do with\n                  interlocking and overlapping timelines one of the things that dan will talk about this evening is\n                  how the earth and the solar system are entering a region of\n                  energetic space and what happened in the future humans history was that the looking glasses amplified the energy from the\n                  energetic space and this caused a pole shift in my personal opinion \u2013 and it is a personal opinion \u2013 one\n                  of the reasons why it is almost like there has\n                  evolved a modern mythology about the pole shift in 2012 the\n                  stories and reports and rumors about this have been surfacing\n                  all over the internet and not all of this is because of what\n                  dan burisch has said it is almost as if there is\n                  a kind of awareness that we all have - maybe unconsciously\n                  - that there is something \u2018round about now that is\n                  really quite important clif high from half past human who uses linguistic\n                  patterns on the internet to predict the future says that he is\n                  able to use this linguistic analysis from the internet because\n                  all humans are psychic at least to some degree even if they\n                  do not know it a lot of people sort of know that there is something\n                  happening \u2018round about now a lot of people feel that\n                  these are special times and maybe dangerous times sometimes\n                  people write to us at project camelot to accuse us of being\n                  depressing and we are forecasting doom and we are\n                  telling everybody bad news we are not doing that this\n                  is not our intention if you want to travel to a particular destination using a\n                  map you have to know where you are so that you can make the\n                  journey if you do not know where you are and you try\n                  and figure out a way to get to where you want to go to you\n                  might end up in the wrong place any counselors and therapists here among you will know that if you are trying to help somebody the first thing to\n                  do is to tell the truth about what is really happening a counselor and a therapist helps the person face up to what is\n                  really happening not because they are trying to make\n                  them depressed but because they are actually trying to\n                  help them out of the situation sometimes that takes quite\n                  a lot of courage but it is also the first step that is\n                  needed one of the things that we have been trying to do at project\n                  camelot \u2013 now i do not think everything on our\n                  site is correct it cannot be because some of our witnesses\n                  contradict each other \u2013 but we think that most of it\n                  is correct what we are reporting on is that there are\n                  numerous situations which we need to be awake to and aware\n                  of in order to handle what is coming one of the reasons for this it is not just so\n                  that you can get your guns and your food and your gold and\n                  then just go and hide somewhere it is not just about\n                  that that might not even be the smart thing to do or the\n                  best thing to do but many of you really understand that there is\n                  more going on here as we say in english more going on than\n                  meets the eye more going on than we can see this is spiritual it is a spiritual game \u2013 and\n                  when i use the word game i am not implying that\n                  anything is trivial \u2013 but it is a game in the sense\n                  that if we play it right then we can ensure a good outcome and we may have opponents in this game something that is\n                  very clear to me  and i know that it is very clear to\n                  many of you  is that really this is a spiritual game i do not really want to use the word spiritual war because\n                  that is a kind of contradiction there is nothing\n                  spiritual about a war one of the things that is very\n                  clear to me is that it is about \u2013 how can i use\n                  the words \u2013 it is about resolving spiritual problems one of the reasons why a lot of us are here  i would suggest\n                   on this planet is because this is where a lot of the problems\n                  are showing up this is where a lot of the problems are visible there are certain things that people can do some of you may\n                  very well be active in this area which is helping to resolve\n                  things at a spiritual level in order to resolve problems spiritually you have got to know what the problems are  so one of\n                  the things that project camelot has been doing is bringing\n                  situations to the awareness of people who are able to operate\n                  on a spiritual level to help resolve them so we are actually operating on multiple levels here you can go and grab your guns and your food and your gold and\n                  go and hide if you want to but that is not actually\n                  what we are recommending i am just saying that as\n                  a kind of joke but i want to just use the next 45 minutes\n                  to lay out some of the potential situations that we may have\n                  in front of us before i even start i want to stress that most of these things\n                  have not happened yet and they may not happen at all one of the things that henry deacon told us when we first\n                  met him he said the problems are complex because everything\n                  is happening at once there is a convergence of problems some of the problems may be connected with earth changes and\n                  the region of space which the solar system is moving through one of the things that david wilcock may talk about tomorrow \u2013 he is\n                  done a lot of research in this area \u2013 is how global warming\n                  has got nothing to do well very little to do with burning\n                  fossil fuels everything in the solar system is heating up\n                  as it moves into this region of space with this sort of energetic influence it seems that there\n                  also comes an opportunity one of the things that david will\n                  talk about is how the very same influences that may be causing\n                  global warming are also assisting with the process of a change\n                  in consciousness i am saying assisting with the change in consciousness because i think that our own personal development has got something\n                  to do with this as well but the circumstances may be making\n                  this more easy to happen may be allowing it to happen so\n                  that is a factor as well the fact that as we enter into\n                  this region that may present dangers and threats everyone\u2019s\n                  waking up at the same time one of the things here \u2013 this is something else that personally i was alerted to by henry deacon \u2013 was the\n                  influence of magnetic pole reversal or changes in the earth\u2019s\n                  magnetic field because whether we are aware of it or\n                  not as human beings our nervous systems and our brains work\n                  electrically and although we cannot see it we are\n                  sort of swimming around in this electromagnetic ocean all the\n                  time and human beings are very sensitive if you start messing\n                  around with the electromagnetics around a human being then\n                  their behavior and their emotions and their attitude is likely\n                  to be affected as well so i wonder how many people in this room have noticed that\n                  every now and then there are people around them that seem\n                  to be behaving irrationally at least to some small degree maybe they are becoming a little more unstable sometimes maybe there are more disagreements more quarrels maybe some\n                  people who you thought were very very level-headed are making\n                  some strange errors of judgment there is a sort of instability which is something that\n                  kerry cassidy and myself started to notice about a year ago we just noticed a lot of anomalous events with peoples behavior we started thinking there is something very strange\n                  happening here this is a pattern and a lot of people\n                  have been commenting on this all over the internet entirely\n                  independently of anything we have been saying this is another factor to take into account the fact that\n                  people might not be responding to situations in the way that\n                  they always used to maybe not as predictably maybe not as\n                  stably on top of all of that there is what david wilcock refers\n                  to as \u201cilluminati politics which is a phrase\n                  that i love what that refers to  that beautiful little\n                  phrase  it just refers to whatever the agenda of people who\n                  consider themselves to be in control of planet earth or wanting\n                  to be in control of planet earth what that agenda might be ruth that was complicated bill that was complicated ruth yes bill okay illuminati politics refers to the possible\n                  agenda of the controllers of the planet or the people who\n                  might want to be the controllers of the planet one of the things that henry deacon alerted us to was a document\n                  called the report from iron mountain now a lot of\n                  people say that this is a fictional document but henry reports\n                  how in an intelligence briefing a number of years ago he\n                  was given this document ordered to read it and then to report\n                  back the next morning henry maintains it is not a fictional document but whether\n                  it is or not it certainly seems to be used as if its contents\n                  were a good description of what is happening one of the many things that the report from iron mountain\n                  talks about \u2013 this is a document that dates back to the\n                  1960s \u2013 is that there are too many people in the planet there is an overpopulation problem and it is possible to argue\n                  that this is a real problem george green talks about the global 2000 report which also talks about the need to reduce the world\u2019s\n                  population in order for the planet basically to survive anyone whose seen or seen photographs of the georgia\n                  guidestones in america in georgia one of the things\n                  that is on the georgia guidestones is a very clear plain\n                  statement that the goal is to have five hundred million people\n                  on the planet which is something like a 90 to 95 percent reduction\n                  of the number of people now there are a couple of things to notice here one is that it is\n                  easy to believe that this intention could exist it is\n                  easy to understand how they might want to do it anyone whose\n                  ever been to cairo or lagos or calcutta or mexico city there is\n                  a problem it is easy to understand why the controllers\n                  of the planet might want to drastically reduce the world\u2019s\n                  population but they have not done this yet or if they have\n                  tried to do it then they have not succeeded one of the things that david might talk about tomorrow is\n                  how \u2013 let me get the wording right \u2013 how human\n                  beings are naturally resistant to viruses that are designed\n                  to wipe them all out it just is not going to happen quite\n                  so easily now that does not mean that there might not\n                  be plans to do this many of you will know that the outbreak\n                  of swine flu from mexico earlier this year it almost exactly\n                  repeats the pattern of the 1918 spanish flu what happened in 1918 was round about february there\n                  was a very mild form of flu that swept around the world but\n                  it was very mild people recovered quickly it was called the three-day\n                  flu a lot of people got flu for three days and then they\n                  recovered and then it was the summertime of 1918 then there was another wave that started \u2018round about\n                  october i think it was of that year and by that time there\n                  was \u2013 it is what virologists call a viral mass \u2013 there\n                  was such a large quantity of this virus around in the population\n                  that it enabled it to mutate now that is something that has not happened yet this morning i looked at an american web site it is called flu.gov now we are not there yet but there is evidence that\n                  the governments are preparing people either for a real outbreak\n                  or for people to be frightened into thinking that\n                  there is a real outbreak and to run for vaccinations\n                  to help them the problem might not be the flu it might be\n                  the vaccinations now i know that you guys have been following this kind of\n                  stuff on the internet and this not the purpose of this talk to go into that in detail but it describes the kind of thing\n                  that they might be planning to do it is a very delicate\n                  line to draw because one of the ways that people are controlled\n                  is through fear so it is very important not to be afraid\n                  of this stuff and it is also very important to know what is\n                  happening so once again we have to be awake and aware of\n                  all of this information now a couple of weeks ago we had a very significant meeting\n                  with dr pete peterson we talked to him \u2013 and when i\n                  say \u201cwe this is kerry cassidy david wilcock\n                  and myself  we all met with this guy two weeks ago and\n                  we asked him about this problem this situation with the timelines\n                  and the time-traveling future humans and the warning of a future\n                  catastrophe  and he did not know about any of that or he said he did not know about any of it but what he did say was - and he really was very animated\n                  and urgent about this - he said that he was as sure as he personally\n                  could be that there really were plans to bring america under\n                  martial law now again we have to draw a fine line here because i do not\n                  want to run the risk of trying to convince you all that this\n                  is going to happen which means that you are more likely\n                  to create it in your own future but he told us that he was\n                  as sure as he could be that there was going to be a collapse\n                  of the financial system and a collapse of the infrastructure\n                  within america towards the end of this year the last information\n                  we got off of him was that this was going to be \u2018round\n                  about the beginning of october now if we have any more information about this and of course on project camelot we are going to make this available\n                  to you this is our duty to do that and that really is all\n                  we know about that but when david talks tomorrow he is going to make a\n                  good case for why we should not necessarily buy into this\n                  kind of plan one of the things that david wants to talk about\n                  is that for years there have been people saying this\n                  is going to happen and that is going to happen and we are\n                  all in great danger  and nothing ever really goes wrong i respect his view about that but we still have a duty to\n                  report what people are telling us one of the things that here in europe we can be reasonably\n                  confident of is that if we see something major starting to\n                  happen in america then it will probably affect us in europe\n                  very soon afterwards if we can make it through to the end\n                  of this year  and not a lot has gone wrong  then i think\n                  that we really will be \u2013 as dan burisch likes to say he said the last time and the only time that he is been\n                  on stage at a conference in laughlin nevada last year \n                  he said there is not going to be a catastrophe there is\n                  going to be a golden age and this is where we go right back to what we were talking\n                  about before that there is the opportunity for us to create\n                  the future that we want just because something is planned it does not mean it is going to happen dan is going to tell us this evening about how he and the\n                  people who he is working with and reporting to are as sure\n                  as they can be that what is known as the timeline two\n                  catastrophe the time for that has passed and it has not\n                  happened we have already taken that fork in the freeway that fork in the autobahn that is going off in a better\n                  direction dan will tell us this evening how he discovered \u2013 or\n                  felt he discovered and then checked out \u2013 that the actual\n                  date of this catastrophe in the future humans history\n                  was the 28th of march in this year and that day passed\n                  and nothing happened now people who refuse to believe that story will say well of course nothing happened because nothing was ever going\n                    to happen but what i invite you all to do is look at\n                    the man who will be here on stage with me this evening and\n                    assess for yourself whether he is telling the truth so dan at the moment is a very optimistic man he feels\n                  that everything is going in the right direction dan says that\n                  the dollar is not going to crash now that is not just\n                  his opinion dan is also very well connected with people who\n                  know what is going on and who know what the plans are one of the things that may be happening when we get information\n                  from different sources that do not seem to all agree is that we may be hearing one plan from this direction another\n                  plan from that direction and we do not actually know\n                  which one is going to be the one that rolls out david wilcock has something to say in the back row here david david bill absolutely yes ruth i did not get it bill david\u2019s reminded me about something else\n                  that dr pete peterson told us about the end of this year what dr pete peterson told us was that president obama was\n                  going to reveal the reality of extraterrestrial contact before\n                  the end of this year he said that he had been told this by\n                  people who knew that the television time on the networks had\n                  already been booked the date he told us if i remember it\n                  right was november the 27th what he also told us was that it was one of these ritualistically\n                  significant dates numerologically he said that what obama\n                  was going to talk about was the reality of contact with six\n                  different friendly et races when we asked him why he used\n                  the word friendly he said well some of them\n                  are unfriendly but most of them are friendly one of the things that pete peterson told us  and this is\n                  a turn of phrase that i love to use  is that he said he\n                  quit working for the u.s government because he did not\n                  like feeling that he had to have three baths a day to avoid\n                  the feeling of being covered in excrement then we asked him\n                  why he worked for the u.s government at all and he said that\n                  a lot of his work had actually been motivated by the fact that\n                  they needed help because some of the ets were not friendly now i do not pretend to know all the complexities that\n                  are involved here it is easy to imagine that as i was\n                  saying about an hour ago that the american government and\n                  the other governments they are literally in over their\n                  heads there is so much going on that they really do not\n                  know how properly to handle this there is a huge amount of evidence that the americans\n                  have been spending trillions of dollars building underground\n                  bases ever since the end of the second world war this is an\n                  almost unimaginably expensive long-term construction project and we are not even talking about the cost of the secret\n                  space program one of the things that pete peterson told us was that the\n                  aurora has now been retired from active use \u2013 the aurora\n                  spaceplane it is one of these planes that is been\n                  rumored to exist for a long time but they have retired\n                  it now they have got better stuff than that they have superluminal craft \u2013 meaning\n                  craft that can travel faster than the speed of light we heard exactly the same story from our witness jake simpson who we met in october last year jake simpson has confirmed\n                  everything which i have said so far today then if we consider the cost of these programs then we wonder\n                  where all the money has gone let me just present that as a\n                  possible answer to the question of where all the money has\n                  gone what is interesting about the underground bases scenario \u2013 and\n                  the weekend before last we talked to pete peterson  he called\n                  them underground cities he says he is been in\n                  them bill deagle also reports having been in these underground\n                  cities jake simpson told us how there is an underground shuttle system\n                  that actually connected north america to australia under the\n                  pacific ocean why would they do this why would they build these facilities jake simpson told us that it was standard defensive military\n                  thinking because they have been aware of a coming\n                  problem ever since the second world war and that the military\n                  thinking basically was that if there are going to be big\n                  problems on this planet then they should dig in this is what\n                  the military do when they are in a war situation they\n                  dig in jake simpson told us some extraordinary information he said\n                  that this is a cyclical phenomena it occurs in cycles this\n                  energetic space which the earth is going through it is\n                  the same series of problems that was responsible for what nearly\n                  a hundred cultures on this planet refer to as the great\n                  flood which wiped out atlantis which was reported by\n                  the great historian plato who never got anything wrong jake simpson told us that in some of these military installations when they had been excavating the bases they had found the\n                  existence of older bases that were not built by us we asked dan burisch about this story he confirmed it he\n                  said yeah he said not only can i confirm that\n                  but i can tell you where it happened he said it\n                  was in norway or was it \u2013 oh god i cannot remember \u2013 it\n                  was either norway or sweden forgive me i will find out in fact i think he said scandinavia which is why i cannot\n                  remember he said there was a really bizarre situation that had occurred\n                  when a particular machine had been abandoned \u2013 because\n                  this is sometimes what they do they build these big tunnels\n                  with these machines and then they just leave them because\n                  they cannot take them out again \u2013 and they went\n                  to another location and then they found the same machine in\n                  a different place but it was not their machine it was\n                  an almost identical machine but it was thousands of years\n                  old what jake said he said yes he said we probably\n                    have handled this problem but you have got to appreciate\n                    that it is military thinking to be \u201csafe it is military thinkingto still have the insurance even\n                  though they think that we are safe so they have not\n                  abandoned their bases they are still down there this is the kind of thing that dan is going to be talking\n                  about this evening this is the subject the essence of it\n                  is that it is a little bit like we are in a movie and you imagine a long movie with a lot of action in it that is maybe three hours long and we are about half an hour\n                  before the end when things are getting really exciting we\n                  do not know how it is going to end but it is\n                  a great movie it really could not be more interesting we are in this movie to change the metaphor it is like a virtual-reality game this is a\n                  spiritual game and this reality is a sort of illusion as the buddhists would say but it definitely feels real if we continue to talk about movies we can talk about the\n                  movie the matrix when this may all be an illusion in a sense but it still feels very real and you can still\n                  get hurt in it so though it is a game there is\n                  nothing trivial about it if we have children and people that\n                  we care about and if we care about this beautiful planet then we have to take it seriously but the theme of this conference is that this is the kind\n                  of virtual reality game that by understanding that it is\n                  a virtual reality game we have the chance to create the outcome\n                  that we want and have as much fun as possible while we are\n                  doing it so this brings us right back \u2013 and here i am going\n                  to finish \u2013 to what george green was saying in his little\n                  booklet messages for the ground crew he was told\n                  that it is nearly too late but the most important word\n                  in that sentence is \u201cnearly all the best movies\n                  have something that is \u201cnearly going to happen\n                  and then it does not happen i am a mountaineer and the best climbs i ever made were\n                  the ones where i nearly fell but i did not those of you who have a loving relationship may know that some\n                  of the best times are when your partner nearly left\n                  you but they did not because after that you have got an opportunity to figure\n                  out how to make it all work out much better after that so as a collective ground crew \u2013 and it is not like\n                  the ground crew of different countries this is just the swiss\n                  ground crew and we say this as a bit of a joke \u2013 but\n                  we are all the ground crew it is possible fifteen\n                  percent of the human race is a ground crew really what we urge you to do \u2013 and when i say we i am\n                  talking about the swiss ground crew and also speaking on behalf\n                  of kerry cassidy and myself in project camelot some people\n                  write to us and they say what can i do what shall i do and we say do what you can do something just start doing\n                    something.when kerry cassidy and i picked up this little consumer-grade\n                  camcorder and started talking to anyone who was willing to\n                  talk to us three years ago we never imagined that the snowball\n                  could have become this big if you dare to believe that things are possible then anything\n                  is possible your ability to make things happen is only limited\n                  by what you believe so do what you can talk to people collect\n                  people together form groups and communities.keep people informed do everything you can do to wake people\n                  up to support them in a transitional process of becoming more\n                  awake and aware and to help them realize that there is a new\n                  world - if they can take it thank you click\n                  here for the\n                  video\n \u00a0\n\n\n\ndavid wilcock\n(dw okay now pete one of the questions that i had for you is\nthat you had mentioned before that you did not like the term\nconsciousness\nfield and you would prefer the term information\nfield i was wondering if you could explain why that distinction was made in\nyour discussion dr pete\npeterson (pp because to me the consciousness\nfield\ndeals with consciousness and the information\nfield\nis mostly unconscious i had like to double click\non that and get more information on that link well the information\nfield\nholds everything in the known universe and there is\nconsciousness\n\u2013 each\nperson has their own consciousness and their own consciousness\nfield it is one of the characteristics of individuality or i will\nsay information field it is one of the characteristics of the\ninformation field that i think the best english word for is the soul\nor spirit the individual consciousness field of each person is very very different the\ninformation field holds everyone\u2019s consciousness while the\nconsciousness field holds each individual\u2019s consciousness or\ntheir i guess we could say spiritual characteristic though i use\nspiritual\nin a very different method than it is used by religions my\nwitness daniel referred to spirit\nas the intellect he said that the intellectual aspects of mind are non-local that\nthey are not happening in the nervous system at all they are\nin the field where those cognitive processes take place i\nabsolutely agree with that they are definitely non-localized they are in the consciousness field which is not localized with\nthe person whatsoever it is everywhere and every-when it is not\na device it is not a part of the neural or even non-neural\nanatomy it is a field it is like a magnetic field or an electric field in some\nrespects \u2013 in the respects of a field \u2013 but it is\nnon-local even though it appears to be somewhat centered around the\nactual individual it may be what\nsome people call the aura but it also has tentacles if you would that extend through time and\nspace to infinity there is\na russian scientist named budakovski who takes a holographic\nphotograph of a healthy raspberry plant shines that light into a\nraspberry tumor and the tumor cells rearrange into healthy raspberry\ncells and it grows a new plant are you familiar with anything like\nthat well i\nam i was not aware of that experiment and would very much like\nto be because i am looking for things that i can instrument and\nobserve to try to come to some conclusions but that to me is it\nwould be a necessity that things be that way right i had\nlike to be familiar with the experiment but for example i found\nout in human medicine for example i have come to the conclusion\n and feel i can prove that to any competent neuro-anatomist  that\nthe dna is merely a factory that generates the physical part of the\nbody the dna gets its information from the informational field in\nhow to do that so you find that the informational field is eternal\nand holds the spirit\nor the being\nor the information\nof the person in perfection \u2013 whereas the perfection then runs\nthrough the factory if the factory is missing the thing that puts\nthe wheels on the wheels are going to fall off if you would and so the\ndna problems that you get with human health and anatomies are errors\nthat are in the dna which it appears are pretty much passed down\nthrough the family tree but there is also information that\ncomes down through the family tree and that is shown by a lot\nof work that was done by joseph chilton pearce for example reported\nby him in the\nmagical child there is information that is\ntransmitted to heart tissue \u2013 actually brain tissue that is\nin the heart \u2013 and that holds most of the person\u2019s\ninformation about emotional things and a lot of information about\ntaste for example they found people with\nheart transplants all of a sudden loved mustard when they could not\nstand it beforehand and they find that the person that was the donor\nloved mustard they find that the person that was the donor was a\nvery loving person where the person who lost their heart lost it\nbecause of a lot of frustration and a lot of stress and they were a\nperson that was not a loving person now they become a very\nloving person and the people around them have no idea how to relate\nto them does each person have the same\ndegree of contact with this information field or consciousness\nfield i would doubt that they do\nbecause they are all individual for example there are people\nwho just seem to be informationally troubled if you would which has\nnothing to do with being you know personally troubled but they\nseem to have problems even when you go in and correct things in\ntheir this is from a health field because\ni spent many years in that field building medical instruments they are all computerized and we had you know years and years\nand thousands of patient visits that we could go back and take a look\nat and correlate the long-term data that was the instruments that\nhave been out there now for 28 years in the marketplace and some\n16,000-plus instruments around the world and well over a\nmillion-and-a-half patient visits so we correlated that data and have\nshown that much of this must be the way that things are so like the\nstatement that you made was one that i absolutely agree with that\nout of necessity there has to be an informational field and out of\nnecessity there has to be something that drives the dna now we have\ndone some experiments showing that we can generate this field around\nthe body and the body will act as if the dna were perfect if they\nhad a genetic disease the genetic disease goes away now with the\nadvent of stem cell research we find out that we can use a person\u2019s\nown stem cells in the body and heighten this field around the body and the cells they had that are replicable cells that had a genetic\nproblem the genetic problem goes away because the informational\nfield holds the perfect information rather than the flawed\ninformation of the gene itself well that is like the budakovski raspberry thing i told you exactly the tumor was transformed yeah yep how can someone strengthen\ntheir contact with this field that they have do you have any\nexercises or ways or technology perhaps anything that they could\ndo i have technology that could do\nthat and that is one of the products that i intend to come out\nwith once we get the laboratory and factory completely built well that is tantalizing but what have you done what could you do what could it do for\nsomeone we will know that once we\nget it done and do the testing on it so i know what i think it\nwould do and you know we have been very successful with these\ninstruments the american medical association publishes every year\nthe number of clinical diagnoses that their doctors they feel that\ntheir doctors got correct this year it jumped all the way up to 6%\nfrom 5% the previous year we have 85% of the patients that use the\nmedical equipment that i am talking about 85% of the patients\nfeel that within two days they do not have what they had when\nthey came do you believe in acupuncture\npoints on the body well i have to believe in them\nbecause they are there and you can go to radio shack or you\ncan go to harbor freight and buy a $4.00 or $5.00 dollar meter and\nadjust the meter appropriately and run those on the body and find\nevery one of the points put a little dot there go compare yourself\nto an acupuncture chart and you will look exactly the same i did find out\nhow the acupuncture system works there have been a number of people\nthat postulated it but they did not show that it worked i\nworked with dr jean claude de roche at the french institute of\nscience he is a very famous acupuncturist he taught the\nchinese acupuncture they did away with acupuncture in the \u201920s\nand made it illegal even though it was practiced down every alley and then during the cultural revolution they brought it back the reason for that was they had a\nhuge plague and acupuncture would not cure the plague but\npenicillin would so the french missionaries brought in penicillin\nand so they did away with acupuncture and went with penicillin but\nacupuncture has its definite uses as does the sister of acupuncture which is chinese herbal medicine it makes sense  if you put\ncertain chemicals in the body and certain precursors you are\ngoing to get certain chemical reactions out of the body so anyway the acupuncture system\nis very interesting what we did is we injected radioactive potassium\ninto each acupuncture point while the person was under a high-speed\ncat-scan machine and we found that the radioactivity moved directly\nto the organ associated with that point kerry cassidy\n(kc oh wow for the 3,300 years that the\nneijing has been around talking about it and for the 6,200 years\nthat ayurvedic medicine has been talking about it so we found\nthere was a direct correlation to not only to the organ system but\nto actual parts of it for example down the outside of the thumb you\nhave a point that gives you information about the entire lymphatic\nsystem \u2013 just below the first joint but above the first joint it talks about the lymphatics that are in the tonsillary ring when we inject here [touching the\nside his left thumb the radioactive material goes to the tonsillary\nring when we inject here [touching same thumb but closer to bottom\nknuckle it goes the whole lymphatic system you go down [indicating different\npoints down the side of the thumb] and you know it goes on down the\nbody the same thing you know if you\nwork across the hand you have lymph and lung and circulation and\netcetera etcetera etcetera pointing to different places on his\nhand] you come over here and you have the heart and the small\nintestine you can go down and inject here and it goes to the mitral\nvalve here it goes to the aorta here it goes to you know this\nchamber that chamber etcetera etcetera then you go down on the feet the\nacupuncture points are the same thing we also found that the\nacupuncture points the acupuncture meridians are not veins they are not vessels the\nacupuncture meridians as they are called are not really meridians they are\nmade up of a if you have ever cleaned a game animal or a\nchicken you will notice that between the organs \u2013 or done\nsurgery \u2013 between the organs there is a white filmy layer that layer is built up like a baklava it is built up in a\nnumber of layers and each of those layers is a capacitive conductive surface not meant for conducting materials such as\nradioactive potassium but it works as does anything in the\nbody the body is a biological mechanism it works like the intestine does peristaltically like the heart\ndoes peristaltically it is ionic in nature so it is\npolarized so it pulsates and moves information so that system was\nan information system the points are just above and below each\njoint and you have them down each side of the hand they are\naround an area that is about a 45-degree angle toward the\nfinger and you can take something like a ball point pen \u2013 i\ndo not see one here  \u2013 but you can take not the point of the pen but the point of the case and you can probe\nabout a 45-degree angle just above and below each joint most people do not know there is\na joint just like this joint and this joint and this joint [pointing\nto the back of his had with the pen right down here at the wrist you can probe those places and on ones where you are having a\nproblem with the organ or organ system you will find a little\nhard nodule under the skin just above and below the joint at about\n45 if you rub\nback and forth past those ones that are not too bad ones you\ndo not have a bad problem you will feel the little nodule\nbut it will actually palpate like it were a little grain of rice\nfilled with coarse sand you will feel a grittiness or a\ngraininess and you go up below the joint and above the joint and so\nyou can tell where you have a problem now what acupuncturists do not\nwant you to know is if you take something that is a little\nmilder rounded and rub that point it will feel really good if\nyou have a problem there and if you take a piece of metal and do the\nsame thing different points will feel differently because the metal\nthing tends to discharge an excess of electric field there and\nplastic would tend to charge up a point of extra field there it turns out\nthere is a type of material called an electret an electret\nis to electric field like a magnet\nis to a magnetic field so there is a way of putting a permanent\nelectric charge on a piece of plastic all the microphones in little tape\nrecorders you have ever seen 99% of them are electret\nmicrophones where you have a little piece of film with a permanent\ncharge as the voice hits it the film vibrates then there is a\npiece of metal next to it and you measure the voltage between the\ntwo feed it into the device and that is where the voice signal\ncomes from so you can\nmake an electret and rub the various points and it will just feel\nreally good and you rub it one time or 50 times and all of a\nsudden it will quit feeling good and you move onto the next\npoint if you do that on your fingers and on your feet you will\nfeel really really good it will normally alleviate almost any\nproblem you have that is what an acupuncturist\ndoes they can find where those places are that you need to have a\ntreatment and do it that way another way to do it is use an\nacupuncture needle and stick it into the point to charge it or\ndischarge it and there is a way to put it in to do either so one of the\nproducts that we came up with is two little pieces of metal that you\ncan have little indentations on them and you can rub your points those pieces of metal have a number of holes in them and people\nasked us what the holes were for if it was critical to the use of\nthe unit and i said no that is where you tie a shoelace and if you loan it to\nsomebody you keep one hand with a shoelace around because they will not\ngive it back to you it feels so good so we have tooling to make\nthose and i probably need to make another batch of them but anyway we found that these were there now it turns out that these points \u2013\nlike this is the lymphatic system here [pointing to the back of his\nhand and this is the lung system here and if you go clear to the\nend of what and there are points up the body if you go clear to\nthe end of where that meridian is they all end at a tooth root the\nteeth are piezoelectric when you squeeze a piezoelectric material it generates a voltage discharge or if you take a piece of\npiezoelectric material and apply a voltage it expands or contracts the teeth are piezoelectric so that is why you should take very\ngood care of your teeth and do not get a root canal unless you\nabsolutely have to have it and not that you will die but your\nhealth will go down so there are some things that we\nhave these little devices will make up for that and will charge you\nup especially people who are missing a lot of teeth get a real real\nsuccess from that and they have very very pronounced little\nnodules and their nodules are usually hard like a rock if they keep\nmassaging them from time to time until it quits feeling it feels\nas good as a scratch on a good itch and when it quits feeling good move to the next one and after a period of time you will feel\nthe granularity and after a period of time it will just get\nsofter and there will not be any little nodule under the skin my mother had a large nodule\nright here and it finally went away but she worked on it for a\ncouple of years it was on the middle finger i have one here as a matter of\nfact and it comes and goes so you are saying that the\ntissues around the organs have an ionic transfer system which is no to\nthe organ they are around the organ but they go all the way up\nthe body if you start stripping out neural tissue in fact it is\nkind of an interesting thing most people do not know that lions\nand tigers never eat muscle tissue it is highly toxic they\nstrip out the blood veins the vessels the neural tissue they eat\nintestines and they eat you know the heart and the internal organs they do not eat muscle tissue really yep if\nthey feed \u2019em muscle tissue and they only give \u2019em muscle\ntissue they will eat it but they get very ill it is very\nhighly toxic but people eat all the muscle tissue and throw the good\nparts away bill ryan\n(br does that mean that we should not eat a good raw steak if\nyou are a meat eater unfortunately it is\nvery obvious that i eat anything that is slower than i am but that does mean that as good as it tastes it is\nnot good for you i am just trying to\nunderstand that is\nalso why the kosher meats have a very specific way of sneaking up on\nthe animal and not alarming them and very mercifully putting them out\nof their demise it is because they do not want that\nanimal to get excited and release a lot of toxins into the muscle\ntissue hm this is not whether they know it or not this is not the typical nervous\nsystem you are talking about with sodium no there is no nervous\nsystem there it is what i am saying right it is\na completely different system there was a korean fellow kim bong\njung who postulated that there was he said i\nfound the neural system and here are pictures of the little tubules\nthat carry a yellow fluid etcetera etcetera and that is all been reported you can find\nthat all over the internet and you can find it all over medical\nliterature but what it does not report is that four years later\nhe committed suicide and said he was sorry for perpetrating such a\nhoax there is not that system people looked for it and\ncould not find it and finally he just had to admit that he made\nit all up hm and so that is not the\nsystem we found how it worked because we injected the radioactive\npotassium and then we looked at it and watched it go through the\nbody and it goes exceedingly fast if you took blood from the tip of\nthis finger and traced it back to the heart it does not move\nvery fast it moves very very slowly it does not race through\nyour veins but if you inject the radioactive\npotassium there we had to get a higher speed cat-scan machine to\neven see it it really races it is the frequency of this it is\nlike milking a cow or a goat \u2013 it is a peristaltic action and it really races through there it is a very high frequency now you are saying this\nis all happening some interface with the consciousness field or the\ninformation field the informational field okay could you explain that what is the energetic component i really yeah that is\na couple hour lecture well could i get the elevator\nversion there is not really an\nelevator version it depends where it is what it is what the\nproblem is which meridian it is okay if an organ is\ndysfunctional why would it matter what is going on in your\nhand it\ndoes not it makes\nwhat is going on in your hand it creates what is going on\nin your hand okay so because they are\nthe extremities somehow because we are built that\nway you are saying you can\neither heal it on the hand or you can heal it directly on the organ right no no no i was not saying that\nat all what i am saying is that problems in the organ manifest\nthemselves both physically and informationally at the appropriate\npoints on the body now if you\nthink about it when you build a car any car that you have had\nin the last 10 or 12 years has an electrical connector under the\nseat you plug a computer in there and it will say the\noxygen sensor\u2019s bad the brakes are getting weak it will say a number of things so let us\nassume that somehow whether divinely or by genetics we were\ndesigned why not design a system where you could test the thing i\nmean we do not come with an operator\u2019s manual but maybe\nwe come with a system that is very easy for us to find out what the\nproblem is and then alter things now one thing\nwe found out is that every substance has an informational field\naround it we found out a way to take that substance place it on a\ndevice and from the device find a numerical signature for that\ninformation field then we found a way therefore to store it in a\ncomputer now we can\ntake the computer and run that information back out and generate\nan informational field we can make that field large so it surrounds\nthe body and we can then measure in real time at these points some\nof which  most of which  are acupuncture points and some are not there are some acupuncture points that we find do not do\nanything even though they are classical points now you know 6,000 years ago or 3,300 years ago they did not have any kind\nof measurement instruments so we now have a bio-feedback system that\nwill actually do that a lot of our audience is going\nto think of the rife machine when you say these numerical signatures that is very unfortunate okay because there is no\ncorrelation whatever it has nothing to do with the rife machine okay did not you work for royal\nrife i worked for rife for a period\nof time yes i know how his instruments worked and it has no bearing\non this whatsoever this is a very gross mechanical type of thing okay and it does not work at\nall like anybody thinks that is another story but anyway threw me off a little bit here in my thinking about this you can play a signature for a\nspecific compound yeah we can make a signature\nof a compound and what happens is the body will react to that\ninformational field as if you had given the person that substance so\nyou can go to an acupuncture point and get information from it that\nyou can graph and chart on a machine and it will tell you whether\nthat organ is in a type of inflammatory process or in a degenerative\nprocess and how much how long it is been there whether it is\nwinning the battle or losing the battle then you can put the person\nin an informational field from a substance that you think may solve\nthat problem and ask the body the body will react exactly as if\nyou have given that substance so you can select a type of\ntreatment when somebody is given a\nplacebo are they affecting their own informational field absolutely placebos work 50\npercent of the time and it is not because placebos have a\nphysical effect they have a mental effect in some instances and\nthey have an informational effect in some instances so you should be able to affect\nyour own informational field without a placebo yes people asked me when i built these very complex computerized machines\nthat do the diagnosis and selection of treatment they asked me what is\nyour goal for this machine and i said my\ngoal is when the doctor throws the thing in the dempsey dumpster and just does it that can be done however the\nmachine takes away his emotional state and his emotional interference\nwith it and the patient\u2019s emotional state and the patient\u2019s\nemotional characteristics with it but one of\nthe machines that i want to come out with in the future is one that is\na bio-feedback device that allows the patient to put himself in an\ninformational or mental state that affects the problem with the body that can be done it can easily be done and other than gross\npoisoning or gross over-consumption of something for example it is very beneficial to have vitamin a we do not get\nenough vitamin a in our bodies but you take too much vitamin a and\nyou will find yourself gaining water and getting ascites and\nsome people die from it many people almost\ndie from it so too much of a good thing is too much no matter how\ngood the thing is a lot of people are going to\nwant to know is anybody using this technology are there any doctors\nthat are using it there are right now in the\nunited states that i know of 18,000 clinics eighteen\nthousand eighteen\nthousand clinics using this technology i taught seven companies how\nto make it about five other companies came in and stole the\ninformation from them which if they had come and asked me i had\nhave handed it to them hm because i\nknew it was going to need 20 or 25 years out there before it got\nitself established and so what i did was i let other people do it and i ran around in front of them like the man that runs in front of\na curling stone and sweeping a pathway for it i went around in front\nof them sweeping a pathway in front of the fda ed note pete is talking about the scottish sport of curling in which a\ncurling stone is slid on ice a man with a broom goes in front of it sweeping the ice smoothing the surface so that the stone can slide\nmore freely we got a very very good publicity\nman whose mother had been given i do not know eight or ten\nweeks to live and we kept her alive for another 17 years oh my gosh he felt very happy about that and so he jumped on our bandwagon out of that it finally ended up about 10 or 12 years later there is actually an alternative\nmedical branch of the fda and that branch handles things like we\nhave in the meantime i spent a lot of money and a lot of time and\neffort and got this device actually approved by the fda that was my next question there must be publications there must be documentation out there well the\nonly documentation i know is when you put my name into a computer it will come up and tell what a fraud this device is and how\nit is a quack device but if you find out who put that in there you will find out that he says the same thing about a lot of\nother things that work then if you go and watch the man you will\nfind that the checks that he cashes at the bank are from large\npharmaceutical companies and from the government at times right so what\nname are they going to put into the computer for that device i am not going to say\nthat i am not interested in thousands of people associating\nthat and being able to show their friends that i am a fraud anybody who wants to know if it is a fraud come to me i will\ngive you the closest doctor and you can go there and ask the doctor\nwhether his 3 5 7 10,000 patients that went there and two days\nlater walked out without their problem think that it is a\nfraud now i know\nit is not 100% placebo because placebos only work 50% of the\ntime and even though the medical people  the ama  says their\ndoctors only get 5% of their clinical diagnoses correct if they\nonly get you know 5% or 6% now this year of their clinical\ndiagnoses correct what do you think they get correct with the\ntreatment you know why they say practicing\nmedicine or on the\nother hand watch the tv show house and in each incidence they tried five or six or seven treatments almost killing the patient each time and then find out what the\nsolution is you know he is supposed to be the best\ndiagnostician in the world you know on television but it is\nvery true to life it comes out of canada they are a lot more\nfrank there and you know you get the picture of practicing\nmedicine they do not have an idea they do not have a way to have an\nidea so i am\nnow ready after 28 years of having this device out there and about\nsomewhere between oh probably $1.2 to $4 million or maybe more patient visits behind it all computerized in the medical\nterminology it is anecdotal\nbecause the patient cannot tell you if they are well or\nthey do not have the symptom any longer \u2013 that is\nillegal but i am\nnow ready to go up against any one of them because i can prove that\nmy diagnoses with this type of machine are absolutely correct because when they go look with conventional diagnostic tools and\nequipment i will see the problem as much as 20 years before it\nmanifests itself in the body where common medical things can test it how can i prove that well i will\nwait 20 years and prove it that is what we have done that is why i have 27 years of testing done on it that is\nwhy i have people that came and thought it was a fraud and did not\naccept the medication but i watched them over a period of time and\nsaw them eventually die of what i told them they would die from so i now have\nenough evidence i am ready to go and do that except i am\nnot going to do that because i do not have any desire to be\nassassinated i have people that have more testicles than i have that\nare willing to do it pardon my 10 years in the marine corps you said there is a lot of\nclones of this technology out there people have stolen it from you\nand they\ndid not steal it from me they stole it from other people i\ngave it away so they could not steal it from me if they had\ncome to me i had have given it to them is it variable in terms of how\nwell they work like oh absolutely the first thing i did was in my instrument when you\ntouch the body in the beginning the person does not know where\nthe points are so i put a point locator and the point locator made\na tone which almost everybody likened it to the sound of a cow that\nwas dying okay so when i\ngave the people how to build this thing they built it and everybody\nsays oh that sounds like a cow dying so they changed the tone they eliminated 80% of the effectiveness of\nthe machine because the tone carried a lot of information that if\nthe doctor had only persisted with it for a month he could then hear\nthat tone and he could cut down diagnosis time from 35 to 40 minutes\nto 2\u00bd to 3 minutes wow it just\nbecame natural he had oh i know what that means i know what that tone means let me try this let me try that he can dial up\non the machine now some 850,000 different substances that are in this\nworld all the medications of every medical system known all the\nherbals of every herbal system known all the magic healing potions\nof every magic healing potion system known all the chemicals that\nare out there that are man-made all the chemicals that you find in\nnature all the vitamins all the minerals all the pharmaceuticals\nin the homeopathic pharmacopeia and in the allopathic pharmacopeia everything\u2019s there so you can do it the machine will help\nyou sort those out and find out exactly what will alleviate the\nproblem and many times\nyou will find something that will alleviate a problem in the for\nexample the small intestine but find that it will aggravate the\nneural system so you say oh well there must be another medication that\u2019ll work and not\ncounteract something here so you can go back and find that particular medication now you know\nwhat to give now you can\nask it okay if i am going to give this how much should i give it will tell you an exact amount and like everything in nature there is a bell curve produced a curve that looks like a bell and you want that medication that is right at the peak of the\nbell curve you want just that amount that\u2019ll produce that\nreaction and \u2013 bang \u2013 you give it many times\nwhen we give the medications to a patient they will bounce up\nand down like they were at disneyland on mr toad\u2019s wild ride and they will say ah ah i have had that pain for 20 years and now it is gone did we heal\nhim no did we cure them no why do i say no because it is against the law do they believe they were healed yes did they believe they were cured yes what makes the\ndifference one thing that i think is\nreally important is if this video is out there online there is\ngoing to be a lot of people that want to claim that they have this\ntechnology to profit from it oh absolutely and it may not be the one\nyou are actually talking about absolutely how do we prevent against that is there any search term we can give people on google i do not know that we can\nprevent against it or doctors that are actually\nusing the right one or the problem is that the first about 6000 doctors i trained and they had machines that moo-ed like\na cow and it was really good and after that it went downhill so again i am building a laboratory and a factory where i will\nproduce these and instead of having to do like you have to do\ntoday pay between $12 and $50,000 dollars for one of the machines oh i have got one that is\nbuilt in a fountain pen and we will probably sell it for around\n$99 wow but there are similar healing\nmodalities in existence which is oh there are some that work\nbeautifully radionics you know go on well yeah there are radionics\nmachines that i am not saying it is\nthe same i am just saying it is something that works yeah it works very well in the informational field oh it works very well and it\nworks with on exactly right it works through the informational\nfield have you heard of the scanar the russian scanar i have definitely heard of\nthe scanar having spent about oh eight months with the people\ndoing it really and\nworking together with them there is another machine for pain it is called the acuscope which was brought to this country by\ntony nebrinski who was the kgb man in this country looking for\nmedical technology to send home to russia there is\na guy named dr hartmut muller who built this led thing that you put\non your skin is that another one that you think works no it does not work no i did not say that oh i said there are things that\nwork a lot better that is what i meant to say okay but people can also as\nyou said massage these points on their hands the best\nmedical machine i ever invented were these two little things we call\nacu-combs [ed note did a search and did not find this device so the\ncorrect spelling of this is unknown that you just rub your points\nwith and get well is there a way people could\nbuild those on their own they\nprobably could as soon as they saw one but it is easier and\ncheaper to buy one from me because i paid thousands of dollars for\nthe tooling and they stamp them out like great shells coming out of a\nmachine gun and they put \u2019em in a tumbler and tumble them and\nthey actually have electric material that we invented to actually do\nthe charging it is interesting in that you can take one of the\nunits and do it by the way you can find out how you will react to any food one of the best\nthings is that anything that goes in the body you say how\ndo my organs react to that there is a reason that the\nhighest-paid doctor is the anesthesiologist it is because he\nhas to pay the most insurance and i think i may be wrong you had\nhave to check what it is these days but when i was working on it two out of every 100 people were killed by the anesthetic that is\nabout\nright this thing will tell you\nexactly because this finger and the distal side of the middle finger\ntells you about food absorption here and allergy here it will tell\nyou whether you have an allergic dispensation toward that medicine that anesthetic it will tell you how your body will react to it how does it tell you by making an indication there is an indication on a meter and on a chart when you learn\nhow to read the meter and learn how to read the chart which can be\ntaught in approximately one minute you can tell whether you are\ngoing to have an allergic reaction or not another thing we found was out of a\nmajor university\u2019s animal husbandry department we found that\nthere are 33 substances that all humans and all animals are allergic\nto most of them are phenolic compounds that have a 6-sided benzene\nring in the molecule and a couple are hormones and a couple are\nproteins we found out\nthat we can measure here and we can find out exactly\n\u2013 if you have allergies exactly\nwhat you are allergic to then we can take that material and\nprepare it homeopathically and give you a couple drops under the\ntongue and that allergy will disappear entirely then after a\nperiod of time it may come back and we will find that you need\na homeopathic remedy of a different what they call potency or\nstrength and then you take that sometimes it takes you three or\nfour days to chase this thing around and find out exactly what you\nneed but eventually you will get to an end point and you will not\nhave that allergy as far as i know and we have tested people\nnow for 28 years nobody\u2019s ever had an allergy come back wow and we are dealing\nstrictly with an informational system here that modern science\nrefuses to do but it does not seem to make much difference to\nthose people who had allergies and do not that modern science\ndoes not like it it does not fit their paradigm which is\nwrong i just want to say on camera\nhere that what we are very clear about having spent quite some time\ntalking with you that you are not trying to get rich through\nany of this you want to make this technology available no i do not no i have\nno need to make any money the only reason i want to build the things\nis so they are built right and they moo like a cow  \u2013\na dying cow because that gives it that lets the doctor do the\ntreatment for much less or the diagnoses for much less money and remember the doctor only uses\nthis to help him in making his diagnoses the diagnoses cannot\nbe made by a machine only made by a doctor yeah that is\nwhy in the beginning we only sold them to card-carrying ama card-carrying mds then we sold a few to chiropractors we sold a few\nof them to osteopaths a few of them to naturopaths then the\nfirst person to have one that was a veterinarian was the veterinary\ncommissioner for the state of nevada and she started using them then we have now i quit keeping track when i started trying to\nkeep in front of these people and keep them out of trouble for using\nthem and we have not had any trouble in using them because we\nkept them out of trouble anyway at the time \u2013 all this\nwas maybe 18 years ago \u2013 there were about 350 veterinarians\nusing them and they were working perfectly they could find out what\nproblems animals had and how to solve the problem folks we are coming to\nthe end of our third hour and there may be a number of other topics\nwhich we want to touch on before well while we have the\nopportunity i know there are a number of other topics i have\nhad my share of the cherry david is there more things you had\nlike to pick up on i know that kerry\u2019s got some questions too yeah i am just sensitive\nto all the emails that are going to be coming in people are going to\nwant to know how to buy these little plates so if you say you can\nmachine them once you are ready to do that can you give us the\ninformation if i had orders i could\nprobably ship within two weeks okay i cannot tell you what\nthey cost i know that one of the plates out of necessity needs to be\ncopper i know that one of the plates the factory that used to make\nmy electric material has gone out of business hm so either i will have to make it or find a factory that does it but\nwe have tooling that fits in a machine called the amada punch press\nthat punches it out faster than you can even see and then it just\nhas to be tumbled in the right combination of things to make it\nsmooth and easy to handle so it does not have sharp edges on\nit but it is not that\nexpensive is the bottom line it is not really that\nexpensive the copper in it now costs about $7.00 or $8.00 dollars\nfor the copper plate and probably much the same for the electric\nplate then we have to stamp it and process it it comes normally in\na little carrying case with a separation between the two okay and a little set of cards that\nyou can fold out that shows all the points on the hand all the\npoints on the feet so there are pressure points where there are\nthings that you deal with indigestion and headaches and that kind of\nthing well you\nhave your first order right now video displays\ndr_peterson_orders@projectcamelot.org\nat the bottom]\n\n\n\n\n   yeah i have taken\nthem to oh i do not know maybe a couple hundred health fairs\nand psychotronic association meetings the global science congress\nand tesla society meetings and dowsing meetings and so forth and\ni have never taken them i started with taking 20 and then i had\ntake 50 and then i had take 100 and i have never found the\ntime that i did not sell out before noon right on the\nfirst day once i sell three or four then everybody is people\ncannot put it down so they are standing there doing it people well where did you get that what does that do and the guy\nis here let me try it no i do not\nhave a shoelace then i had start giving a shoelace with them so they had get\nthem back so anyway people like the way it\nmakes them feel they like the way it makes their hands feel and\nthey determine by themselves without any help from the government\nthat they actually do something for them that they like and so they\nbuy them hm well yeah i think it is\nreally important to note that the healing is within we all have this\npower to heal ourselves like i said in any medical\ndevice that i have ever done and i have also by having\nthe machine as a bio-feedback tool i found a number of substances\nthat do miraculous things for the body such as out of\nall those substances and all the machines the best thing i ever did\nwas the plates they are not expensive what i tell people is if\nyou think about this right you can just throw the plates away which\nbrings up another device that i will be putting out that looks\nlike a cigarette pack \u2013 that is a bad thing to use \u2013\nlike a pack of playing cards and maybe that is even bad to use but it is a little device that has a headband that you have a\nlittle electrode you soak with salt water in the front and the rear and it salt water salt\nwater just regular salt water table salt you put that on and it\nmakes a tone and we give a little cassette tape that makes a tone and you can learn to with your brain you can learn to match it is\nlike if i hum or whistle yankee\ndoodle\nten times you can hum yankee\ndoodle and if i do\nmary had a little lamb you can do mary\nhad a little lamb this makes a sound and you learn to generate that sound by holding\nyour tongue right have you ever seen a watchmaker work the position of your tongue\nchanges the tone no no that is what i\ndid not want to say oh if you watch someone that is\ndoing precision work like an engraver or a watchmaker they do it\nthis way okay yes they have to hold their\ntongue in a certain way and it lets them do things but you do not\nnecessarily have to hold your tongue right you learn how to hold\nyour mind right so this gives off an even\npitch but the pitch is varying no it is not an even\npitch it is a varying pitch it sounds like whistling a tune okay so you\nlearn to make that tune by thinking right and eventually you will\nput it on and if you do different things mentally you will get\ndifferent tones so you learn to hold those tones so you get the\ntone that was on the little tape and when you get to that point you\ncan then alter these things without the plates you can just do it\nmentally this is going to make me sound\nstupid but people in the audience are going to compare that the\nmonroe tapes with the binaural synchronization in the ears yeah is there any relationship with\nthose none whatsoever i did not think so is\nthis like an ekg like it is a brain wave no no okay what is making the\ntone an electrical field that is\ngenerated by the body so why these two points then because those are the ones that\nwork okay so is it used only for healing or are there other my\nfavorite thing to do with it is find somebody that is into\nbrainwave analysis and brainwave work and go have them implement me and then play yankee\ndoodle\nfor them with my brain they immediately say oops the machine is broken we have got to fix it because\nnobody can learn to do that sorry i can teach anybody to play yankee\ndoodle\nwith their brain in two weeks but i mean are there and once\nyou learn to do yankee\ndoodle you can do mary\nhad a little lamb\nin about ten minutes let us\nsay you have a guy that can move things with his mind he has\ntelekinesis yeah and he makes a song on this\nthing he makes a song and you buy\nthe song from him like buying an mp3 thing and you make that\nsong chances are very good that you are going to run that\nlittle ball bearing around through the maze with your head really yeah that is very interesting i can tell\nyou that government agencies have bought those by the thousands how would you get an electrode\non the back of your head is not that going to go through your\nhair well surplus-wise i bought\nabout 10,000 little fold-out razors that are used to scrape hair off\nthe body when a surgeon needs to sew it up you just put a little\nshaving cream on it and scrape a little piece off and and there is a headband\nyou wear there is\na headband you wear and there is two little electrodes made out\nof a special metal and they have a little cotton sock over them you\nsoak this you take water and you put it in a little bowl and you\nstir water and salt together until there is no more salt to\ndissolve and you dip those in there and squeeze them out a little\nbit use a little wash cloth with some soap on it and wipe the grease\noff the area here  and the grease off the\narea back here that you have balded you put it on and it works just fine wow how precise do you have to\nbe in placement does it have to be right smack on no within a couple inches oh no it\ndoes not go on the third\neye a lot of your people will ask that it goes in a different spot okay but it is\nvery easy to tell where it goes because you put it on and it is not\nmaking we will call it brainwave\nnoise that is not what it is but then anything that is not\nhooked directly to the brain is not brainwave noise anyway i have a 60-second question\nbefore this tape goes out why would the agencies be interested in\nstuff like this oh i do not know that i\ncan say that okay we will leave it to\nour imagination leave it to your imagination okay i can\ntell you that there were a lot of them bought at sri ed note stanford research institute]\n\n\n\n\n  uh-huh and a lot\nof them were bought by to teach remote influencing i did not say that i\ndid not even hint that i said that i would not do that if i\nwere you oh not\nunless you had like a visit you will\nhave a visit if you mention it and you will not\nlike it music plays\nover pp\u2019s voice saying been\ninvolved with trying to build flying saucers you usually found with\nflying saucers if you look at most of the movies there always seems\nto be a robot involved with it bob dean (bd i hope i can be heard will someone turn\n                  this on before i begin i would like to say a couple of words of deep\n                  appreciation for the sponsors and people who have put this\n                  program together i have been involved in speaking publicly\n                  all over the planet and all over the united states i have\n                  been to conferences here i have been to conferences there and i know how terribly difficult it can be to put a program\n                  like this together i have to say i have tremendous respect and admiration for\n                  the people who have done this most of all i respect their\n                  courage for dealing with a subject like this where most of\n                  the elite leadership and the power groups of the world want\n                  this subject to go away and these courageous young men who\n                  have put this together are brave and they deserve your respect\n                  and your admiration and i want to say i thank you because\n                  i know what you have been through now i must explain something else to you i never read from\n                  a script i do not have a prepared script to follow i\n                  get up on a stage and i talk to people like yourselves and\n                  i kind of wing it i have so much material and i have such a problem of keeping\n                  it under the allotted time that i have been given i have\n                  come today prepared to speak to you for three hours i am only\n                  allowed one hour and fifteen minutes so something is going\n                  to have to give but bear with me i will do the damndest\n                  job i can it is important that you see the photographs\n                  of the nasa pictures that i have brought with me.now my journey began 45 years ago i began a journey that if i had known then what i know now if i had known the pain the anguish the heartbreak that i was going to experience\n                  over these 45 years i might not have started that journey\n                  at all but here i am in barcelona in 2009 with some of the most delightful\n                  people i have ever met and looking back i find that the journey\n                  was worth the effort it was worth the pain it was worth the\n                  heartbreak i am delighted to be here and i am delighted\n                  to see all of you out there this is such an encouragement to me that people are beginning\n                  to demand the truth they know they have been lied\n                  to from the very beginning and they want to know and i am\n                  going to  here this afternoon hopefully  contribute one\n                  small measure to helping you understand and helping you know.most of my adult life or most of the first\n                  part of my adult life i was a professional soldier i was\n                  in the army i joined the army in 1950 to avoid the draft ended up going to officer\u2019s\n                  candidate school (ocs and so help me god while i was\n                  going to ocs at fort riley kansas the north koreans invaded\n                  south korea the next thing i know i am on the front lines in korea\n                  being shot at by a bunch of pissed-off chinese and north koreans\n                  who tried to kill me  and i had nothing against them i did not\n                  want to kill them here i am in 1951 leading combat troops\n                  in korea in one of the bloodiest wars we have ever had and\n                  the rest i guess you could say is history i led combat troops in korea in 1951 i spent 27 years on\n                  active duty and i also was involved in the war of southeast\n                  asia in 1970 where i was part of an organization that gathered\n                  intelligence in the jungles of southeast asia south vietnam laos and cambodia let me tell you some of those years were\n                  rather harrowing.the most harrowing experience i was to have was when i was\n                  assigned to paris france in 1963 to what we considered in\n                  those days a plush assignment a plumb assignment i was able\n                  to go to paris france take my family with me and my children\n                  went to high school in paris and as i said this was a plumb\n                  assignment i had no idea what i was to find when i got there when i arrived in the summer of 1963 i arrived with a top\n                  secret clearance when i arrived at the supreme headquarters\n                  allied powers in europe which was located at that time in\n                  a small town known as rocquencourt right outside of paris my security clearance was upgraded to cosmic top secret which\n                  was then  and still is today  the highest level of security\n                  classification that nato has i had to have a cosmic top secret clearance to work in shoc supreme headquarters operations center the war room i was\n                  a senior master sergeant at the time and when i was assigned\n                  in shoc i was given the job of maintaining the duty roster we worked on a 24-hour basis day after day after day and\n                  i was given the job of running the duty roster when i worked\n                  in shoc back in those days  let me tell you the war rooms were\n                  somewhat primitive you have seen pictures today i am\n                  sure of the control centers of the most major installations\n                  like s.a.c in colorado springs everything\n                  is electronic everything is demonstrated on the wall extensions\n                  just like this mural that is up here back in those days we had teletype we had field telephones\n                  and if we wanted something on display we had to go up and\n                  take a pin and put it on a wall and show the controllers where\n                  this division was where that soviet regiment was and so on\n                  and so on very primitive.when i arrived in the summer in 1963 i heard rumors about\n                  a study that was underway now it interested me instantly because the study was about ufos and i was intrigued by that\n                  possibility i was curious about ufos and had no idea then\n                  what they represented but we used to discuss this in shoc in the war room that something was underway what was it about what happened well it appears that on the morning of the 2nd of february\n                  1961 world war iii almost began it was involved in the flyover\n                  of large numbers of circular metallic craft flying in formation very obviously under intelligent control they would fly out\n                  of the soviet sector in the warsaw pact toward the u.s in\n                  formation at a high rate of speed and at a very high altitude they would turn north over the english channel over the southern\n                  coast of england and then they would disappear off of nato\n                  radar over the norwegian sea on that morning of the 2nd february 1961 world war iii almost\n                  began the soviets went on red alert the nato forces went\n                  on red alert everybody was you know fingers on their\n                  triggers thumbs poised above those red buttons and world\n                  war iii was just moments away within 20 minutes it was all over the objects flew turned\n                  north and disappeared off of radar it was all over after\n                  this event occurred a british air marshal by the name of\n                  sir thomas pike who was a deputy supreme allied commander\n                  in europe at that time he was the deputy to my boss general\n                  lyman lemnitzer an american four-star general who was known\n                  as saceur supreme allied commander of europe air marshal pike says i have had enough of this these\n                  objects had been showing up regularly from time to time as\n                  i said they almost triggered a war.air marshal pike said we\n                  are going to come to terms and find out what the hell is going\n                  on here i want to know so he began a study he initiated a study in shape [supreme\n                  headquarters allied powers europe] headquarters that was to\n                  last for three years they published it and issued it in the\n                  summer of 1964 while i was there working in the war room they\n                  titled it an assessment an evaluation of a possible military\n                  threat to allied forces in europe that is all it had just a title head and front could not\n                  learn very much about that an assessment an evaluation\n                  of a possible military threat to allied forces in europe i was working in the war room one early morning around 2:00\n                  or 3:00 a.m and as i jokingly used to refer to it the coffee\n                  was too black to drink we read all the newspapers and magazines many of you have heard military life is about 99 percent boredom\n                  broken up with one percent of sheer terror and that is\n                  the way it used to be and that is the way it probably\n                  is even today i am sitting there nodding off and this\n                  american air force full colonel looked at me and he says wake\n                  up.he went over to the vault the vault at shoc was a walk-in\n                  safe you opened the door and walked in and we kept classified\n                  documents in there the colonel went over to the vault the\n                  file and pulled out this document and threw it on my desk\n                  and he says read that that\u2019ll wake you up.ladies and gentlemen my life changed i opened\n                  the first page and i could not put it down i read and\n                  read and read and i read it every time i was on duty in the\n                  war room i was shocked i was stunned by the implications\n                  of what i read in that study as i said my life has never\n                  been ever quite the same the study briefly  and i have to briefly\n                  lay this out i could talk for two hours about this  but\n                  the study simply concluded this is there\n                  a threat to allied forces in europe apparently not they concluded that the planet earth and the human race had\n                  been under some kind of survey or observation going on for\n                  hundreds if not thousands of years they concluded in 1964 that there were at least four different groups coming here observing us surveying us analyzing us closely watching\n                  us what we were up to what we were doing they concluded\n                  that it did not appear to be a military threat involved because\n                  their repeated demonstrations of incredibly advanced technology\n                  demonstrated to us that if they had been hostile or malevolent there was absolutely nothing we could do if they were evil\n                  in their intent and they were hostile toward us it would have\n                  been over a long time ago.so the conclusion was there were four different groups involved they have been coming here for a very very long time apparently\n                  they were not malevolent or hostile the question was what\n                  the hell are they doing here why are they here and why are\n                  they interested in us well we did not know in 1964 what their\n                  agenda or their motives were and i will tell you honestly\n                  and frankly that even today our authorities our senior military our national security people still do not totally grasp\n                  what their motives are what their agendas are well this study in 1964 was simply a beginning for me as\n                  i said i was never really quite the same again i jokingly\n                  say i am usually a normal human being and after i read\n                  that study and launched on my 45 years of research i lost\n                  all aspects of normality i will be frank and tell you that\n                  over the years of my study and the material that i have learned\n                  and gathered has brought about in me a complete destruction\n                  of my old world view my old world paradigms the world view that i held since i was a kid growing up \n                  everything made sense you know i knew why i was here and\n                  i knew where i was going what was taking place after i spent\n                  45 years on this it all collapsed around my knees that was\n                  the destructive aspect of my personality that was the part\n                  that changed me completely from the kind of human being that\n                  i had been before into the kind of human being i am today ladies and gentlemen i am totally alienated no pun intended i said in a couple of interviews and previews and such i\n                  have had  for many many years  a love-hate relationship\n                  with the human race one moment i love you the next minute\n                  i hate your guts one minute i adore you for the potential\n                  and the beauty of your music and your literature and your art\n                  and the next minute i am saying to hell with all\n                  of you blow them up let them blow themselves up clean\n                  the planet off get rid of them that is part of the struggle of having lost your old\n                  worldview when your whole paradigm collapses around your knees so the man standing in front of you here today is literally\n                  a human wreck as compared to what i used to be but i feel\n                  pretty good about it i lost all my old illusions i opened\n                  my eyes and i saw the future and i am very happy about\n                  what i see i have learned over the years from an infinite variety of\n                  sources here there and everywhere i did not retire from\n                  the army until 1976 and i kept my top secret clearance up until\n                  that moment after i retired i went to work for the federal\n                  emergency management agency and worked another 14 years for\n                  the u.s government where i had a top secret clearance so i have a total of 41 years of federal service to the united\n                  states but i have heard things over the years that literally\n                  still today stun me and shock me i have learned that the\n                  human race is a hybrid race i have learned that we are\n                  not merely alone we have never been alone we have had an\n                  intimate interrelationship with advanced extraterrestrial intelligence\n                  from the beginning of our history and let me tell you that\n                  that intimate interrelationship is still going on.this one race in particular apparently reengineered us as\n                  a species about 200,000 years ago what we are here today is\n                  what we call homo sapien sapiens  you are an\n                  engineered creature your genetics have been manipulated you are\n                  not the same as what you were and you are not the same as to\n                  what your children and grandchildren and great grandchildren\n                  will be in the next hundred years the human race is going through a transition it is more\n                  than a transition it is what i have learned to be a transcendent\n                  transformation into a new race into a new future and your\n                  descendants will be as different from what you are here today\n                  as what you are from the old australopithecus happened to be\n                  many years ago that is not something to be afraid of it is something\n                  to look forward to you are growing you are developing\n                  and you are becoming a new race a new species your grandchildren your great-grandchildren and the descendents on in the next\n                  century or two have destiny in the stars do not you doubt\n                  that for a minute this species this race this troublesome bunch of monkeys has a destiny in the stars and we are a part of this infinite\n                  universe filled with intelligent life and we have been from\n                  the beginning but we are only now beginning to wake up and\n                  see it only now are we beginning to open our eyes and listen\n                  with our ears and look out there and say all right where\n                  have i been what am i now where am i going as i said your destiny is in the stars your\n                  generations to come your descendants your grandchildren and\n                  your great-grandchildren will go out there and they will claim\n                  their rightful place in a universe filled with\n                  intelligent life your place out there belongs to you you\n                  have a right to that and you will claim it there is so much to talk about i have got some slides\n                  that i have to share with you would you gentlemen please put\n                  the first picture up on the screen i am being assisted\n                  by some very wonderful people back behind the scenes i like to start with a shot like this pictures of this nature\n                  inspire me it gives you a glimpse of the community you are\n                  a part of a little glimpse of the stars out there the nebulae that is where you are from and that is where\n                  you are going home again to that is where you belong next picture please i love these they are so beautiful i have some of these\n                  on my wall at home they inspire me i look at them and i have\n                  the sense of recognition that i have been there before\n                  and i know that i am going back but something happened in my country over the last few years\n                  that i am very very troubled by just last week the united\n                  states celebrated the 40th anniversary of putting a man on\n                  the moon they went through this whole whoop-dee-do of patting\n                  ourselves on the back gee was not that neat armstrong aldrin you know collins up there in orbit on the moon are not\n                  we great people are not we magnificent look what we\n                  did well let me tell you about a couple of things they did that\n                  you may not have ever have heard about before they took the\n                  few pictures they had they had it all televised everybody\n                   rock walter cronkite and all of them were looking up golly gee is not this great is not this neat we have\n                  got a couple of guys on the moon ladies and gentlemen my government nasa which many of us in the united states say stands for never\n                  a straight answer proceeded to erase 40 rolls of film\n                  of the apollo program  the flight to the moon the flight\n                  around the moon the landings on the moon the walking of guys\n                  here and there they erased for christ\u2019s sake 40 rolls\n                  of film of those events now we are talking about several thousand individual\n                  frames that were taken that the so-called authorities determined\n                  that you did not have a right to see oh they were disruptive socially unacceptable politically unacceptable i have\n                  become furious i am a retired command sergeant major i was never famous for having a lot of patience the idea when i found out that they had erased 40 rolls\n                  of film involving of several thousand individual shots about\n                  what really happened up there i became so furious that you\n                  know i could have punched the director of nasa in the nose i am not the easiest man i like to tell people that like henry higgins in my fair lady i have the milk\n                  of human kindness by the quart in every vein so i really am\n                  a gentle man but i have the capability the potential of being\n                  rather dangerous and violent and these lies and these cover-ups\n                  that i have learned about firsthand over the years literally\n                  infuriate me and i hope it infuriates you because these authorities these nit-wits in\n                  high positions of power who are proceeding to spend all the\n                  money the american people make for their own use their own\n                  private programs and then lie through their teeth about what\n                  the truth really is.well thanks to the idea that there were a few employees in\n                  nasa 40 years ago \u2013 even today there are some good people\n                  working there decent people honest people \u2013 i have\n                  some film that they preserved that was not destroyed gentlemen put up the next picture for me this is a nasa photo this is apollo\n                    12 apollo systems 12 roll number 50 negative number 7348 they were flying over the moon before they landed they went\n                    into orbit around the moon as many of you know i am\n                    sure this is no secret they went into orbit around the moon\n                    and while they were there in orbit around the moon a number\n                    of anomalous artifacts began showing up showing interest\n                    in them next picture please.ah this\n                    picture was taken by neil armstrong while looking out\n                    of their window of their little craft this object flew by there is the moon in the background of course below the\n                    object that flew by the window of that little craft that\n                    they were riding in neil took the hasselblad camera that\n                    he had put it up to the window and snapped this picture next picture please.ah nasa\n                    apollo 12 roll 51 negative 8653 something like that now this is a good-sized object this is several hundred\n                    feet in diameter that came up next to the lander and flew\n                    along beside them for a time the guys in the apollo craft\n                    put their camera to the window and snapped the thing and\n                    i have always jokingly said there were guys inside of\n                    this taking pictures of the nasa craft we were photographing\n                    them they were photographing us next picture please.photo nasa\n                    apollo systems number 14 \u2013 apollo 14 \u2013 roll\n                    70 negative what is it  9837 or 9887 this is the lansberg\n                    crater on the moon the guys in orbit above the moon were\n                    particularly fascinated by lansberg they had been given\n                    a special assignment to take pictures of lansberg because\n                    the crater which they designated as the lansberg had things\n                    going on in the crater that were very anomalous there was\n                    construction going on there were enormous facilities in\n                    the crater up there so they were specifically designated and assigned to photograph\n                  lansberg to see if they could figure out what the hell was\n                  going on down there in the crater on lansberg while they were\n                  looking at lansberg this object happened to express interest\n                  in them and flew by now this line is an artificial line that\n                  was drawn to show you the it gave the direction that\n                  this object was going this is a good-size object flying past\n                  the apollo lander god i am so glad that some of these were saved i still\n                  get angry 40 rolls of film for christ\u2019s sake and they\n                  erased them anyhow next picture please this is the same\n                    photo of lansberg but the next negative 9838 of this\n                    object here flying by next picture.ah now we are getting into some nitty-gritty i want\n                  to give you just a brief little bit of history here back in\n                  the early days of nasa and the apollo programs i got this\n                  picture from the japanese space agency the japanese nasa they have a tremendous program going over there in japan you\n                  know the japanese are bright people the japanese space agency signed a contract with nasa years\n                  and years ago to buy copies of every picture nasa took during\n                  the apollo program and i am sure the japanese people\n                  paid a sizeable amount of money for this contract and as the\n                  films were developed and the photos were made they shipped\n                  them off to japan and the japanese had a tremendous reservoir\n                  of goods of regional nasa pictures they bought them they\n                  paid for them so this photograph was released by the japanese\n                  space agency you can see the japanese writing here this\n                    was taken by apollo 13 now you are all familiar i am sure with apollo 13 that was the aborted mission\n                    that was going to the moon to land and they had an accident\n                    on the way they could not land they damned well barely\n                    got back while they were on the way to the moon \u2013 here\u2019s\n                  the moon \u2013 a number of things began happening some strange\n                  objects were appearing outside the windows of the spacecraft\n                  so the guys grabbed their hasselblad cameras and start taking\n                  pictures this photograph shows three different objects this looks\n                  like a circular object with an enlarged dome on top this is\n                  a smaller object with a circular kind of disc-shaped craft but coming in from the right margin of this picture is this next picture please.here we are this\n                    is a blowup of the positive in the photograph and here\n                    is a blowup of the negative of this object here ladies and\n                    gentlemen this particular object is five miles long i am\n                    tempted to use the term big mother no pun intended\n                    because it appears to be a mother ship it is gigantic five miles long and here are these nasa guys are up there\n                    in this little cramped apollo capsule and they look out\n                    their window and they see something that is five miles long it shakes them up a little bit and when it got back to nasa these pictures shook them up a hell of a lot next picture please.ah this\n                    is the next sequence here this large mother has moved\n                    into the middle of the frame and something else has come\n                    up over here which has been estimated to be two miles\n                    long but this really upset the guys i have never been able\n                    to find out which one of the three apollo members of the\n                    apollo 13 group would admit to ever having taken these pictures so as you know the apollo astronauts were threatened with\n                  their lives i kid you not they were threatened seriously they even threatened their families if they ever divulged any\n                  of the information that they knew next photo please.here we are here\u2019s\n                    the big mother here\u2019s the other one two miles\n                    long here\u2019s a picture of the positive this is the\n                    negative this mother is five miles long up here you can\n                    see what appear to be two circular objects either arriving\n                    or departing from that particular big ship i can almost understand why the authorities in nasa why the\n                  authorities in the space program did not want this information\n                  to come out they were frightened they were stumped they\n                  could not deal with it themselves and they figured if\n                  they could not handle it you could not handle it there would be social disruption i believe is one of the\n                  terms they used they would disturb the body politic i believe\n                  the term they used so they clamped the lid down on this and\n                  it is still down and it is going to stay down i am afraid for some time yet until people like yourselves and me and\n                  the rest of the people here on this stage by pushing and prodding\n                  and chipping away at this lie and the secrecy until eventually we will succeed and do not you doubt that for a minute.ah now i am in for another photograph which i think\n                  will shock you some in 1980 nasa  never a straight\n                  answer  launched the voyager program to saturn they\n                  launched this little mechanical space ship filled with cameras film and so on they wanted to go to saturn because something\n                  had been going on in the rings of saturn around the moons\n                  of saturn that did not make a lot of sense some anomalous\n                  events were taking place in saturn near saturn at saturn so they launched the voyager in 1980 the pictures\n                  they got back from voyager was so stunning and so shocking\n                  that they just locked them up in a safe fortunately i met\n                  and developed a friendship with a retired nasa scientist by\n                  the name of norman bergrun norman bergrun worked for nasa for about 30\n                  years he was a technician a scientist on the voyager program\n                  to saturn in 1980 norman decided after waiting a number of\n                  years for nasa and the authorities to be candid and honest\n                  and forthright and tell what they really found up at saturn and norman got so frustrated he wrote a book ed note the\n                  ringmakers of saturn] i think he could not publish in the united states no\n                  american publisher would even touch it norman bergrun had\n                  to go to scotland for god\u2019s sake to aberdeen to get\n                  his book published and he published it he did succeed he\n                  got his book it is a piece of genius it is a beautiful\n                  piece of work and the things that they photographed near saturn\n                  appeared in print for the first time.this\n                    is the a-ring of saturn i think you are all familiar\n                    with what saturn looks like it is a beautiful planet it is a giant but it is got rings all around it well this is the a-ring and here\u2019s the object that\n                    is self-luminous obviously artificial larger than our moon that seems to be moving all around throughout the rings of\n                    saturn and among the moons of saturn and saturn\u2019s\n                    got a couple dozen moons this object here as i said larger than our moon moving\n                  all around apparently under intelligent control in the rings\n                  of saturn now try for a moment if you can to imagine the\n                  kind of a technology that is capable of constructing something\n                  larger than our moon that is artificial that moves around\n                  wherever it wishes to go that has probably got several thousand\n                  guys inside that is shocking to some people next picture please ah this is the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance i guess as the french say here you have another\n                  self-luminous artificially constructed object circular\n                  in shape larger than our moon that is also moving\n                  here there and everywhere throughout the rings of saturn and\n                  among the moons of saturn you know there has to be intelligence\n                  aboard but this is the one that really blew the nasa people on the\n                  voyager program out of the water this object \u2013 this\n                  is an object guys \u2013 is 2000 miles long it is 400\n                  miles in diameter and it is an artificially constructed norman\n                  calls them an electromagnetic vehicle he says they appear\n                  to be making the rings this is one of the rings of saturn i think this is b-ring bergrun says he thought they were probably\n                  making the rings i said norman you have to consider\n                  the possibility they may be mining the rings i think the rings are probably rich in nutrients in minerals\n                  probably and an incredibly advanced civilization i think would\n                  work out some system of mining those rings for all the minerals\n                  up there and utilizing them because space is filled with wealth energies of all kinds they never have to dig another hole\n                  in the ground like we do down here space is filled with energy this is 2000 miles long and here on this end there seems\n                  to be something like an exhaust or a flare of energy of some\n                  kind it is probably the result of engines of some type\n                  inside this thing but whatever it is doing it is\n                  there and it is a recognition and representation of an\n                  advanced intelligence and that is one of the things that they do not want\n                  you to know  that we are confronting and relating with an\n                  intelligence that is so far beyond our own we are\n                  looking at and talking about what is known as a type\n                  ii civilization now for your own interest  i suspect most of you suspect\n                  this  but you are all members of a zero-zero-type civilization beyond us hopefully in a century or two we might become a\n                  type i but this is a representation of the type ii civilization.michio kaku the famous japanese-american physicist in new\n                  york has put out this concept about type ii 0 i ii iii\n                  and iv of the kind of advanced cultures and civilizations we\n                  will probably meet out there well we will probably\n                  meet out there we have already met them they are\n                  here they are in our midst ed note the type i through iv civilizations\n                  were first conceived by a russian nikolai\n                  kardashev]so i brought about 15 or 20 of these pictures but i simply\n                  have no time i do not have the time to show them all so i have shown a few here and i think i have piqued\n                  your curiosity and i think most of you are pretty bright\n                  people and you know you have been conned you know you\n                  have been lied to you are not fools and i think you know\n                  who you are and why you are here and where you are\n                  going next photograph please.ah this is a photograph taken by our mariner space vehicle\n                  that we launched back a number of years ago this\n                  is a picture of a facility on the surface of mars now this facility is located on the equator and it is on\n                  the surface and those of us who have studied it and discussed\n                  it with each other call it the airport i said this is the parking lot (oval flat area this is the\n                  administration building here (raised semi-circular area adjacent\n                  to the left of the oval this is the main terminal here (structure\n                  directly behind the oval flat area and i imagine it is a\n                  pretty busy facility you know with ships coming and going but it is not an airport it is very likely a spaceport it is on the surface and it is\n                  on the equator of mars and if you are ever interested in launching\n                  a vehicle from a planet you put it on the equator and you\n                  take advantage of the rotation of the planet to assist in the\n                  launching of your vehicle you can take the momentum of the\n                  movement of the planet and it helps you get the thing off the\n                  ground so it is exactly on the equator it is on\n                  the surface and it is massive in size so maybe that is the parking lot i do not know maybe\n                  that is the admin building but there is something going on on mars and i have been going back and forth with richard\n                  hoagland now for years where richard who i know most of you\n                  are aware of is convinced that mars is covered with ruins well it is but it is not just ruins there are things going\n                  on on that planet on the surface under the surface continually\n                  so next picture please.ah this was published in a german magazine but this is a\n                  soviet photo this\n                  is from their phobos 2 spacecraft this is a city under\n                  the surface of mars that is the size of chicago chicago is\n                  one of our biggest cities several million people live in chicago this is under the surface you can see the city block breakdown\n                  here portions of the neighborhoods here or whatever it is but it is generating an enormous amount of heat and they picked\n                  this up on the infrared when phobos was going around the planet\n                  snapping pictures like crazy.the soviets were pretty open about releasing some of their\n                  photos contrary to the united states where lying has become\n                  a fine art do not get me started on my politicians phobos\n                  2 the city on mars under the surface you can see the streets broadway first avenue whatever people have said well who is there and i says for god sake it is the martians who are\n                  there what a silly question to ask who is there next photo please now i love this picture - earth i love this\n                  lady your ancestors and mine called her gaia she was feminine she was a goddess she was sacred this beautiful lady has\n                  a respiratory system she has a circulatory system and she\n                  has a heart she is our source of life on this planet we needed her we\n                  need her now we would not be here if it were not for\n                  her we talk about holy lands mecca jerusalem here there everywhere that is the holy land people  that beloved planet\n                  that we are on next picture please.i spoke to you earlier about the fact that your grandchildren great-grandchildren and so on  the generations yet to come\n                   have their destiny in the stars and meantime they will\n                  go out there and claim their rightful place in that infinite\n                  community of life you can believe that and you can accept\n                  that with an assuredness and truth that goes beyond doubt the destiny of this species and this race this troublesome\n                  clan of monkeys is in the stars and there is your destiny i want you to understand that and have some hope and do not\n                  get depressed because you are going to be undergoing some\n                  very difficult times in a few years left ahead we are going through this transition this transformation this transcendent transformation into another species into\n                  another race and if you remember your own adolescence it\n                  was a painful time the species the race is going through\n                  adolescence but we are not alone we are getting\n                  helpers.we have family out there that is helping us and they have\n                  been helping us for a long time they have been trying\n                  to encourage us and nourish us and trying to point the right\n                  direction for us to go because we are a troublesome adolescent\n                  children and we are going through that transformation but\n                  my point is that there is no doubt about the inevitable destiny\n                  and truth of the human race now i want to quote something for you if you will bear\n                  with me here one of my favorite authors poets was a man\n                  i have admired for years count leo tolstoy tolstoy said\n                  that there is something in the human spirit that will survive\n                  and will prevail that will survive and prevail and there is\n                  a tiny brilliant light burning brightly in the heart of man\n                  that will not go out no matter how dark the world becomes and in the years ahead when things are difficult and economic\n                  problems take place there will still be disruptions fear hope sadly enough i am afraid there will still be blood\n                  in the streets here there and everywhere this coming out\n                  of adolescence is not an easy process but then what do you\n                  do when you leap beyond adolescence you reach adulthood you\n                  grow up and we are growing up now ladies and gentlemen my journey is coming to an end but for many of you out there your journey has just begun and i want to show something to you before i leave the stage\n                  this afternoon no matter how dark the world becomes you can\n                  be sure as tolstoy said there is a spark there is a flame\n                  burning in your heart that will never go out no matter how\n                  dark the world becomes and as my journey is coming to a close and\n                  for some of you your journey is just beginning i wanted to\n                  say to you in a term that i think is absolutely appropriate \u2013 you\n                  spaniards have got some beautiful terms in your words \u2013 vaya\n                  con dios i have never\n                  been to spain before but it is one of my favorite\n                  places i love you guys and now i am learning to love\n                  the spaniards in italian i learned to say this and i will\n                  say it to you and i understand you know the meaning in closing i want to say to you all keom [ed note phoenetic kerry cassidy (kc everyone i am kerry\n                  cassidy from project camelot.this is henry deacon henry has something he wants to say to bob bob this is henry deacon and we just want to say something\n                  here this is henry deacon from project camelot for those of\n                  you who are familiar with our website he is here today and he is here at the conference he has something he had\n                like to say bob about mars.henry deacon (hd i do not have any words but bob has\n                  expressed everything that i would have said and i can confirm because i have been working in top secret for 30 years\n                  at above top secret we share a common background but i just\n                  met him recently here and i can only say that yes there is\n                  life on mars there are bases on mars i have been there i did not even get started in telling\n                  you some of the things that i wanted to share this afternoon\n                  about who and what is on the moon and mars that\n                  henry knows it is a long story as he said there is not time\n                  to put it all together except that it is a positive story it is not one of fear he showed a picture of mother earth\n                  and it is giving birth and there are birth pangs but\n                  there is a child that is being born and just forget about\n                  the fear because that is just really a temporary thing there she is so a friend of mine angelica who no one knows she calls\n                  this the emerald planet and it is alive yes it is very much alive we are a part of that lithe\n                  life form and life spreads throughout this whole galaxy and\n                  the rest of our family is watching and waiting and helping\n                  quietly behind the scenes and i have been fortunate enough\n                  to be able to meet family that do not just live here on\n                  terra for a long long time even before i was in government\n                  work so thank you thank you henry deacon for those of you who do not\n                  know ladies and gentlemen am i still broadcasting\n                  here announcer you are still broadcasting audience tell us about mars and the moon screw the breaks i am going to share a small story with you before\n                  i run out of time and i am going to ask the gentlemen\n                  to please bear with me and give me just a few moments i attended my son\u2019s\n                  retirement ceremony in washington d.c in november my boy\n                  retired in november in washington as a full captain in the\n                  united states navy after 30 years of service and while i was\n                  at this retirement party the room was filled with admirals\n                  and generals and retired commanders and captains and so on and we all had something cool in our hands and we were all\n                  moving around each other amiably and relaxed you know a retired navy scientist whose name must remain untold came\n                  up to me nudged me and said i know you and i said yes i am eric\u2019s father no no no he said i know you you are\n                    that notorious retired command sergeant major with the big\n                    mouth and i said yes i will go with that he said i have to share something with you before the\n                    party is over.he said i retired several years ago my\n                    last job was at a government laboratory in nevada a few miles\n                    from las vegas i am a plasma fusion physicist that is my\n                expertise that is my training my background my occupation.not being a scientist i go what what a plasma fusion\n                    physicist he said yeah i worked at this laboratory\n                    outside of las vegas it is not commonly known it is fairly secret i worked five years with\n                    two guys who are not from here they were from somewhere\n                    else they\n                    were delightful people they were scientists they were working\n                    with us they were assisting us they were encouraging us\n                    and offering us ideas and possibilities and one thing and\n                    another in plasma fusion which is infinite energy forever and he says i got to know them pretty well he says after\n                    a couple of years i went up to one of them and i said what\n                    do you guys really think of us human beings and this chap from somewhere said well since you have\n                    asked we think you are \u2013 how did he word it a\n                    primitive savage and dangerous race and the scientist said i had to agree with him we\n                    are we are a primitive savage and dangerous race at the\n                    moment the other chap was standing there who had been listening\n                    in he was also from somewhere else he said you\n                    also smell bad you humans stink nothing\n                    personal mind you we find that you do not smell good and the scientist said my first thought was you know i did not spray under my arms this morning maybe and they tried to explain that we humans have a psychic odor\n                  about us that they pick up and they find it terribly offensive so it hit me between the eyes because when i was a boy growing\n                  up my grandmother used to say if we could only see ourselves\n                  as others see us.it would help so much to develop our integrity and our character\n                  and all that and this remark of my grandmother hit me that\n                  we were getting this so-called from the horse\u2019s mouth from\n                  one of our extended family out there that you are\n                  primitive savage and dangerous but you also stink.i thought that was humorous and i shared that with gogo and\n                  she said please include that in your presentation so\n                  gogo bless your heart i did that for you you know goodnight everybody one sentence it relates directly to what bob has\n                  said if you want contact raise your spirit high that is\n                  what they want because they do not want to mix with you\n                  if you are savage beasts it is that simple just\n                  relax and be happy and work with each other it is a very\n                  simple message thank you henry thank you if you want to learn more about henry deacon he is on our site we have a lot of very long transcripts all about who he is some of where he worked and about mars we also have a video\n                  called jumproom\n                  to mars in which\n                  david wilcock bill ryan and i discuss some of what he told\n                  us we are\n                  looking for maybe a fifteen-minute maybe half-hour tomorrow\n                  when henry deacon can address you and maybe tell you some of\n                  the details thank you let me add one more sentence i must add this i have traveled all over the planet and i have spoken to conferences\n                  all over the world and all over the united states i have never\n                  been to a conference of this nature without there being at\n                  least one and generally two of the others in the\n                  audience i want you all to think about that and look\n                  around you and know that in your midst you have\n                  good friends in high places and they are\n                  in your midst and i have learned over the years to recognize\n                  them it is your family exactly they are family but like ingo swann i have\n                  developed the intuitive ability to spot them and recognize\n                  them and now i have them coming up to me at conferences introducing\n                  themselves to me there are no limits life is infinite and\n                  forever god bless all of you and i will tell you goodbye\n                  this time click\n                  here for the\n                  video\n \u00a0\n\n\n\nbob\ndean (bd ladies and gentlemen let me express my deep appreciation\nfor your attendance here this afternoon it is gratifying to me\nto see such a turnout from the spanish media in\nmy country you have to grab the media by the throat and drag them\nkicking and screaming to pay attention to this subject so i am\ngrateful and have much gratitude for your attendance here this\nafternoon let\nme apologize to the beautiful translator interpreter to my right i am notorious for not following script or instructions so i will deviate somewhat from my prepared comments this afternoon and i will tell you essentially what i have seen and what i have\nlearned and what i have concluded about what i consider to be the\ngreatest story in the history of the human race it\nis not merely the study of the history of\nthe\nhuman race or in the history of the human race it is really\nessentially the study the conclusion of\nthe\nhistory of the human race ladies\nand gentlemen we are not alone and we have never been alone we have had a history of an intimate interrelationship\nwith advanced extraterrestrial intelligence from the beginning of our\nhuman history i\nspent 27 years on active duty in the united states army i led combat\ntroops in korea in 1951 in one of the bloodiest wars we have ever\nfought i gathered intelligence in southeast asia in vietnam cambodia and laos in 1970 but\nin 1963 i received an assignment to the supreme headquarters allied\npowers in europe at that time this was considered to be a choice\nand\nplumb\nassignment\nin the united states army i was excited about the assignment i took\nmy wife and my children to paris france my children went to high\nschool in paris and learned to speak fluent french and i was given\nan assignment to the supreme headquarters operations center a place\nwe called \u2018shoc i am\nnot trying to make a joke but when i arrived i was shocked at what\ni learned it appeared that an event occurred on the early morning of\nthe second of february 1961 that almost started world war iii large\nnumbers of circular craft of some kind flew over central europe out\nof the soviet sector toward the west over nato and allied lines these objects were circular metallic flying at a very high\naltitude and flying at a very high rate of speed and they flew in\nformation very obviously under intelligent control they would\ngenerally fly to the west and they would turn north over the english\nchannel the southern coast of england and disappear from nato radar\nover the norwegian seas in\nthe early morning of february \u201961 world war iii almost began the soviets went on red alert all nato forces went on red alert our\nfingers were poised on the triggers and over those red buttons and\nthe whole thing was over in about 20 minutes a\nbritish air marshal by the name of sir thomas pike decided to\ninitiate a study to find out what\nthe hell was going on here they\nconducted a three-year study i arrived in the summer of 1963 and\nlearned that it was underway and they published the study in 1964 all\nof us who worked in the war room and all of us who had a cosmic top\nsecret clearance were shocked and stunned by what we read they\nconcluded that the human race and the planet earth had been under\nsome kind of observation and study for a very long time they \nwhoever they were  were deeply interested in us and had been\nobviously observing us and studying us for a tremendous amount of\ntime hundreds\nif\nnot thousands \nof years the study concluded that if they had been hostile or\nmalevolent there was absolutely nothing we could do the study titled an\nassessment also\nconcluded that some kind of a program was underway even today we\nstill do not know what that program is all about ladies\nand gentlemen that was the beginning for me i spent the last 45\nyears trying to determine what this is all about and what does it\nmean and i have concluded that this indeed is the greatest story\nin human history we are and have been members of apparently an\nintergalactic culture and civilization and a community of intelligent\nlife we\nare dealing with four particularly different races they are all\nhumanoid but one group is totally human just as we are the\nconclusions are that we are hybrids\n we\nhumans are hybrids our relationship with them is one of a fellowship and a brotherhood and they are assisting us and trying to come to terms with who we are\nand why we are here the\nbiggest question basically is where\nare we going do we have a future as a species and a race and i will tell you bluntly and honestly that i believe that our\ndestiny is in the stars now\nwe talk about forgive me for deviating again here sweetheart i am\nso sorry just last week my country celebrated 40 years of\nanniversary of the landing of the apollo on the moon they take great\npride in saying look\nwhat we did is not this neat we went to the moon but\nwhat they did not tell the american public is that nasa\npurposely erased 40 rolls of film about the apollo landings they\npurposely erased 40 rolls of film on the apollo landings and would\nnot release this information to the american people the\nbig secret was what we found when we got on the moon we found\noverwhelming evidence that we were not alone they followed us all\nthe way to the moon they followed us around the moon they followed\nus all the way home and they watched every move we made while we\nwere on the moon all\nof this was filmed that explains to you why those 40 rolls of film\nwere erased but not all of those pictures disappeared there were\nsome honest people working in nasa back in those days and some of\nthose pictures survived and i have brought a considerable number of\nphotographs of those nasa pictures with me to this conference and i\nam going to share them tomorrow night i\nmust tell you they are shocking they are stunning and to some\npeople they will be literally overwhelming but i will say to you as\ni will say to the american people and have for the last 20 years damn\nit you have a right to the truth and\nto use a military term you\nhave a need\nfor\nthe truth and\ni want to thank you and good evening kerry\ncassidy (kc david wilcock is a really stellar individual as\neveryone here knows and we thank him very much for being who he is\nand for putting himself in such a dedicated place to serve humanity\nwith his life we honor him for that and we stand right at his side that\ndoes not mean we agree on everything or how it will roll out or this\nor that but in the main we agree all right and we are very happy to\npresent him here today david wilcock david\nwilcock (dw thank you thank you kerry all right we do have a\nlot of material to cover we do not have a lot of time how many\npeople here need a bathroom break or are you ready to just keep\ngoing audien\n go go just go all right now you video guys do you need me to wear a\nlavalier mic for the video recording or you are okay all right the other\nthing is if you guys are doing this live streaming can you cut back\nand forth between my slides and my face as it is going out live can\nyou do that okay because there is going to be a lot of slides and\nthey will go fairly quickly okay now we have gotten the business taken care of let us get down to the\nreal work which is this subject of 2012 what i\nwill be proposing tonight is definitely not your typical approach to\n2012 it\nis very important to understand on an intrinsic level that what we\nare dealing with is not channeling it is not mayan prophecy it is\nnot ancient religious teaching it is not speculation and it is not\npsychic it\ndoes not require anything except the exacting measurements of the\nscientific process and the insight to be able to take information\nthat has already been put out there by nasa by mainstream scientists\nstudying the mysteries of what it means to be a biological life form the mysteries of the solar system the mysteries of energy and\nmatter and how does matter and energy truly function when you\nstart looking at the hidden mysteries of science which are already\nout there now you find out that the human species is undergoing a\nmassive evolutionary process right now and i am going to prove that\nto you i am\ngoing to prove to you that the nature of this evolutionary process\nfundamentally rewrites dna and biological life to such an extreme\nthat within one generation \u2013 i will show you the proof in this\npresentation \u2013 that a creature can give birth to something that\nbecomes an entirely different species than the creature whose womb it\ncame out of and\nthat there is nothing more that needs to be done to create that\nenergetic change but to simply zap the embryo with a\nlight wave that comes from another\nembryo that has the genetic pattern that you wish to transfer the only\nway that this makes any sense is to begin seeing dna as susceptible\nto quantum wave effects you\nmay have seen most of you have probably seen 2012\nenigma which is a video of mine\nthat i am proud to say was number one most viewed on google december\n1st of last year the\nreason why it got that way is because the information has rocked the\ninternet it has led to my getting the starring position on a syfy\ndocumentary coming out in november on syfy network it is led\nto penguin contacting me to write a book based on the video one of\nthe biggest publishing companies out there it\nhas led to my working with  i am going to say this now publicly \njim hart who wrote the movie contact\nwith jodie foster that is our screenwriter thank\nyou i am working on wanderer\nawakening which is the album cover\nyou see here in the slide with the nine-time grammy-winning\nmusician larry seyer the\nreason why all this big talent and why all this attention is being\nfocused here is not because i may have been somebody else in another\nlifetime it is not because i have done psychic readings it is not\nbecause i put prophecies on the internet that later were shown to\ncome true the\nbiggest thing that i bring to the planet right now is to simply look\nat ancient prophecies that we know to exist that we can document in\ngreat detail and to then give a scientific framework for these\nprophecies on such an advanced level that we are looking at things in\nan entirely different way so let us get back to 2012 enigma\nfor a minute most of you have seen that video you may remember that\ni discuss an experiment that was conducted in which a tiny what is\ncalled a buckyball was shot through a grating the grating is 100\nnanometers wide the buckyball itself is only about one or two\nnanometers wide it goes through the grating and it turns into a\nwave the\nbuckyball itself which is supposed to be a macroscopic object goes\nthrough this little slit and for whatever reason it turns into a\nnon-local wave now\nwhat does quantum non-locality\nreally mean it means that you do not know where the wave is in space you also do not know where the wave is in time quantum\nnon-locality shows that the more you try to find out where it is in\ntime the less you can find it in space the more you try to find out\nwhere it is in space the less you can find it in time if\nyou look at the quantum physics equations it is well known in quantum\nmechanics that the time has to be both backwards forwards \u2013\nit has to be completely non-linear in the traditional sense albert\neinstein has given us the theory of relativity the theory of\nrelativity is going to tell you that when you travel through space it is not empty space what did einstein call space he did not call it\nspace he called it space-time the\nreason why he called it space-time is that he said you are moving\nthrough something that makes time start running faster as you go\nthrough space so you could literally be inside a spaceship leave\nthe earth for two weeks flying at the speed of light come back and\nit is 500 years later we\nknow that this has been proven it actually was done on jumbo jets\nflying at the highest altitude they could where they had little\nwatches on them or little radioactive time-keeping devices and they\nfound very subtle but definite changes in the speed of time just\nbased on the velocity of a jet going around earth orbit so imagine what happens when you go up towards light speed now this is\na proven principle in physics as you move through space you are also\nmoving through the so-called time fabric the space-time fabric as\neinstein called it there\nwas a mistake that einstein made in his scientific understanding of\nspace-time it may be a mistake or it may be that he figured it out\nand he did not want to talk about what he discovered in\nthe einstein relativity theory it is assumed that the only direction\nyou can move is into the future \u2013 if it is space-time the time\ndimension is only one dimensional but we actually now know from the physics of dewey larson which you will\nalso see on my 2012 video that the whole way that the quantum world\nis being built is that there is a domain in which time as we think of\nit is three dimensional and space as we think of it is one\ndimensional that\nworld is constantly interchanging energy back and forth with\nspace-time we call it time-space\nover there it is space-time\nover here so this time-space realm over there is sending energy into space-time\nand it is pinging back and forth \u2013 and that is what creates\nmatter the\nreason why this is important is that if you can get over into\ntime-space then you can actually travel a physical distance and\nreturn to space-time and you have now time-traveled and it is not\njust the future you can actually travel into the past if\nyou are traveling in the direction that the earth is rotating and you\ntravel ahead of where the earth was rotating when you left you are\ngoing to end up in the future because you now re-emerge in\nspace-time ahead of where the earth was on its timeline when you\nleft if\nyou travel west that is into the past east is the future west is\nthe past and again it is going to sound ridiculous and for those who\nare uneducated they will blast me on the internet and say that i am\nfull of it but the fact of the matter is this is very much provable stuff i have had\npeople write me and say that the science in 2012\nenigma is ridiculous well go to www.reciprocalsystem.com read dewey larson's books because there are several of them and find\nout for yourself how he breaks down every single problem in quantum\nmechanics and shows you have got to have three-dimensional time so\nall we are saying is if you can get over into time-space it is going to look like everything does here because every atom and\nmolecule around me right now is here because it is exchanging with\ntime-space so there is time-space stuff in every place around me that\nmeans all this stuff exists as a parallel structure in a parallel\nuniverse and when you go over there it becomes your three\ndimensions of space it is going to look the same because the energy\nof it is the same energy that is here in space-time now here is where it gets really confusing if it is not already\nconfusing see in my\nmind i do not have to worry about this stuff it comes in very\nnaturally you\nactually have an energetic pair\nto your physical body which is in time-space okay but there are\nall these bonuses that your energy body has in time-space that your\nphysical body does not have here what i am\nliterally telling you is that every nook and cranny every little\nfunny fold of your brain exists as a parallel energetic structure\nthat is coupled with the cells in your brain that interfaces with\nthe cells in your brain that interfaces with every molecule of dna\nin your body that is\nwhere all thought processes are actually occurring they are not\noccurring in your nervous system at all in terms of intellect the body\ndoes produce certain forms of thought you have an autonomic nervous\nsystem you have a cerebellum that keeps you from falling over makes\nsure that you are balanced by working with the fluid in the chamber of\nyour ear the cochlea you have\nall of the basic systems that are going to make sure that your heart\nis beating that your lungs are breathing that your eyes are not\ntaking in all the information peripherally so that you can focus on\nwhat you are looking at you\nhave a screening mechanism that is going to screen out background\nnoise so that if there is television on and somebody is talking to\nyou you are going to listen to them talking and not hear the\ntelevision you are not going to hear all the input and weigh it the\nsame those\ntypes of things are biologically-driven systems the body makes those\nthoughts for you all\nof the actual intellect all of the actual thinking that you are going\nto be doing in your mind is not in the body at all you have a\nparallel body a parallel brain a parallel nervous system that is an\nenergetic nervous system but it does not look like your physical body because your physical body\ndoes not have billions and billions of strings coming out of it it\ndoes not have an instantaneous energetic connection that you can\nvisibly see to everything else in its environment what\ni am asking you to visualize as strings is actually simply an energy\nfield in time-space you are part of that energy field and your mind\nis not simply that which is created within your own energy field it\nvery much is affected by all these other things that are around you including the thoughts of other people the\nvery fascinating case of norman mailer the famous novelist who wrote\na novel called barbary shore in this novel he starts out writing about one main character and\ngradually changes the novel to write about a russian spy the russian\nspy becomes the focus of the entire novel he goes into great detail within\nthe same week that he finishes barbary\nshore a russian spy was arrested in\nhis same building that he was living in \u2013 just up the stairs\nand down the hallway now does\nthis mean there was a conduit that was going through the air vent so\nthat he could hear what this guy was saying of course not what\nit does mean though is that that man was so emotionally charged\nbecause he was at the end of his rope and he knew he was going to get\ncaught that his mind was sending out signals and norman mailer's\nmind is an energetic phenomenon which is sensitive to its\nenvironment and picked up the signals that were being generated now again i talked about the experiment where buckyballs are shot\nthrough a hundred-nanometer grate a little tiny slit they turn into\na wave just by hitting the grate it is like it makes them like flip\ninside out and go from space-time where they are a particle into\ntime-space that\nsolid particle which has 120 atoms in it it is not just like some\ntiny little thing it is a ball it is got structure it is got form it is got shape it literally popped out of our space-time entirely it\nflipped over into a realm where time is three dimensional space is\none dimensional and it smears out \u2013 it is partly in the past it is partly in the present it is partly in the future in that state\nit looks like a wave because you cannot measure where everything is\nanymore so now get a load of this the dna molecule is only slightly wider than\na buckyball which means the dna molecule is also subject to quantum\neffects in which the molecules within your dna are phasing between\nbeing here in space-time and being in time-space where they actually\nare stretched out through linear time and they are sensitive to all\nthe other energy fields around them now\nagain this is science all we are doing is we are starting with\neinstein's relativity we are saying that as you move through space you move through time the faster you move through space the faster\nyou are traveling through time in\ntime-space you can move not just in the future but into the past as\nwell depending on what direction you are traveling the\nrussians have identified the \u201ctime field which means\nthat if you speed up the time field in a small area time will run\nfaster or slower in that area compared to everything else around it they have got lots of experiments with little wrist watches and stuff\nwhere they put them in the time field and the time field makes it\nspeed up or slow down now pyramids are one of those things that will make those watches change\nspeed so a pyramid is an actual symbol of something that will cause\nchange to occur the\npyramid is a symbol but it is also a technology \u2013 it is also a\nmachine the symbol\nof the pyramid is that which is reaching up it is something that is\nreaching for the heavens it represents geometry and there is\ngeometry that makes this energy field of the time field i am talking\nabout function it is all based on geometry which is more complex\nthan what we are going to do in this presentation the\ntime field is something which not only affects the passage of linear\ntime it also affects the health of your body the more of this time\nfield that is flowing through your body the healthier you are going to\nbe and paradoxically the slower you are going to age it is when\nthe flow of the time field stops that you move out of eternity that\nyou move out of timelessness it is when time stops flowing through\nyou that you stop being an eternal being and you begin aging remember\nthat scientific study that deepak chopra talked about in ageless\nbody timeless mind where he gets a\nbunch of elderly people and he puts them in a room where it has the\nmagazines of 40 years ago it has the radio broadcasts it has all\nthe furniture everything what\nhe found was that within a very short period of time all these\npeople had a remarkable turn-around where they started to reverse\naging they actually started getting younger in a way that is\nmolecularly biologically provable that is because the time field\nstarted flowing again they started to have hope the time\nfield is that which gives you inspiration if you want to know\nwhether the time field is really flowing through you or not you can\ntell because you will be in a state of uplifting gratitude and\npositive emotion it\nis a scientific fact that the more that your mind goes into that\nstate of resonance of positive attitude of fearlessness of\ncourage you are causing time to flow through you faster which means\nyou have the power of eternity at your fingertips which means you\nare at the forefront of the human evolutionary process but this is not something that only relies upon your ingenuity and your\ndedication to a spiritual path it is something that is being done\nfor you by forces that are very mysterious because they are much\ngreater than what you would normally think of as your conscious mind you\nwant to talk about the monolith in 2001\nand how mysterious that was that is not even the beginning of what\nwe are talking about now this\nbig stone slab shows up and all of a sudden all those cavemen learn\nhow to use tools and they can kill each other now and they become\nthe dominant species then at the point where the movie goes into the present the monolith\nshows up on the moon commander david bowman at the end of the\nmovie ends up becoming the new adam the new species of humanity after he goes through a stargate there is\na lot of things that are known on the inside and this stuff is not a\nsecret it is not a secret even though it has been kept secret it\nhas been attempted to be kept secret it is not secret all\nof the information we need is already here so that we can\ndefinitively understand that what is happening to the earth is a\nnaturally-occurring process it is a sacred process motivated by\nforces of intelligence that would stagger the imagination back\nin the old days you had a lan system in which a computer was just a\nmonitor and a typewriter you plugged it up to one central computer\nand everybody's little dummy terminal as it was called was plugged\ninto that one computer on some\nlevel each of us is the dummy terminal we appear to be separate we\nappear to be an identity that has an ego that has a body and we\nidentify with the body on some\ngrander level the body is merely a projection it is like if you have\na prism and light is going through the prism and as it rotates you\nsee these rainbows around the room each one\nof you is one of those rainbows but would you say each of those\nrainbows are each an individual generator of light no the light is\ngenerated by whatever is striking the prism those individual pieces\nof rainbow light are just the reflections of the one light that\nstrikes the prism if\nyou want to really get into the esoteric science and understand what\nthe ancient prophecies are telling us and why it is so relevant to\nwhat you are going to hear in this talk try to vibe into the fact\nthat the entire manifest universe that matter and energy itself are\nbut reflections of this one singular light that all visibility in\nthe universe everything we can measure is a reflection into what we\nthink is space and what we think is time but when\nyou start really understanding what time is you realize you can go\nwhatever direction you want - forwards backwards and sideways when you\nunderstand space you realize that space does not pose any obstacle if\nyou can pop through to time-space back and forth from space-time to\ntime-space you can\nwormhole yourself or portal yourself or whatever they want to call\nit from any point in the universe to any other instantaneously that is how it is done because there is no actual location location\nis an illusion which is based on the rules of the road so that we\nhave one intelligent super-being that has wanted to experience\nmultiplicity it has wanted to experience separation so that it can\nreunify in\nterms of how that functions in our galaxy the galaxy is generating\nintelligent waves which you are going to see the proof for in this\npresentation and those waves upgrade the speed of this time field or\nof what i call \u201cthe source field the speed\nof vibration of the source field is going up if\nthat speed represents how well you think it is no different than you\nupgrading your computer and going from this ridiculously bad\nprocessor where you could barely even get any of your websites to\nload because it takes so long and getting this really fast machine\nwhere now every page poof sorry\nabout that she almost jumped right out of her seat i will\ntry to do that a little more delicately next time okay so you broke me out of my trance now now i have got to actually talk\nfrom the ego how is it going man what the hell was i talking about back\nto himself] all right let us see we have got to the get the download\nback in play here when\nwe understand that this energy field is part of the galaxy that the\ngalaxy is a conscious being the galaxy has energy that must be\nconscious the energy that is in the entire universe must be\nconscious and it must create life life\nis the divine imprimatur\nof all energy in the universe all energy in the universe is built to\ncreate life the\nphysicists call this the \"goldilocks principle\" and they\ndo not even have a clue as to how far the goldilocks principle goes \u2013\nit is not too hot it is not too cold it is just right that is\nwhat they are talking about in terms of planets like ours and how we\nhave just the right amount of oxygen just the right amount of water just the right temperature all these things are perfect it is not\nan accident life on earth is not some random little thing that only\nhappens once in the history of the cosmos life on earth is actually\nprogrammed to be here we\nhave to get rid of this idea that well we do not have\nto i try not to use must\nand have to because those are very strong words it\nwould be beneficial to learn that there are forces out there much\ngreater than the human intellect much greater than the ego much\ngreater than the body there\nare forms of consciousness that could be an entire planet that could\nbe the sun that could be the galaxy which is really nothing more\nthan a bunch of suns and planets in a big cluster well we\ncan prove that that is going on so i am going to start showing you\nsome things here the\nfirst criticism that anyone will have when you go into a 2012\ndiscussion is they say well nothing\nis really that different everything's the same slide is this just another \u201cordinary time in history we are\npretty much doing the same thing now that we have always been doing we\nget a little bit of progress here a little bit of progress there but nothing is going on right now there is nothing unique or special\nabout this time in history i beg to\ndiffer this is a\npicture that you are going to see from the fires in australia slide picture of a koala bear drinking water from a small water bottle held\nby a fireman with one paw in the hand of the fireman]\n\n\nyou\nmay not think of this but koalas in the wild are actually quite\ndangerous they will claw you and scratch you they will attack viciously\nto protect their home but\nwhen it comes to these earth changes this koala was more than\nwilling to accept nourishment and love from a human a wild koala he is not scratching he is not attacking now this\nis the thing that people do not seem to understand the universe is\nbuilt to deliver the experiences that are already happening the\nuniverse is not a cosmic comforter that hands you a lollipop when you\ndo not love yourself and says oh i am\njust going to just send you all these people who are going to love\nyou because you do not love yourself and oh i am sorry you do not love\nyourself let me send you loving people is that how it works what happens to you when do not love yourself what does the universe send to you does it send you a lollipop hey look at that that person does not love himself that person does not\nhave a high opinion of himself i have a puppet now i can manipulate\nthat puppet i can make that person do what i want because they are\ntoo afraid to go against me they want to be polite they have such a\nlow self esteem that if i tell them something that i want them to do they are not going to want to upset me so what the universe actually does is that if you have a weakness if\nyou have something you do not like the universe says oh you do not like that well here have some more have some more until\nyou get to the point that you simply accept experience and accept\nyourself and when you learn to accept yourself you will not be\nmanipulated because you will decide that it is better to preserve your\nsovereignty than be manipulated by someone else you will\ndecide that your state of mind being positive and uplifting is a\nbetter state for you to be in than the state you are going to have to\ngo through temporarily to really piss somebody off when they are\ntrying to manipulate you because\nthey are going to take it personally they are going to get angry they are going to throw hate at you that is what they do that is what\nthese types of people do now we are not judging those people except insofar as that they are in\nconfusion they are living in a confusion that makes them think that\nthe body is who they are and they are trying to do things to comfort\nthe body at your expense this\nis the meme that is going on on the entire planet that is what a lot\nof these talks that you have been hearing are about we are talking\nabout how much corruption and greed and rottenness has festered into\nthe society and the structure of civilization on earth in\nthe governments in the militaries and the corporations in the\nschool systems in the financial systems  throughout everything\nthere is this corruption this molding that has occurred let us get\nout of the idea that this is a victim consciousness that we are going\nthrough that is what i had recommend you\ndo what you want but this is how i have decided to live i am\nnot going to be anybody's victim i am not going to be anybody's\nslave i claim\nand i ask you with me right now by your applause to claim your\nfreedom and your sovereignty in this moment let us have a hand for\nthat applause hoots whistles] all right if\nyou can claim your freedom of positivity your freedom from fear that is the most threatening thing to the negative controllers in\nthis world because this is a frequency war the\none thing they do not want you to have is a positive loving feeling\nin your day-to-day lives if they can keep you thinking that you are\nat the brink of destruction that nuclear missiles are ready to\nincinerate the earth that the economy is ready to collapse that\nyour government is ready to herd you off into concentration camps they have\nwhipped up this fever to such an extent that people are bringing\narmed weapons to gatherings where the president is because now fox\nnews wants you to think that obama is the same old thing i\ndo not care if that is what you believe or not but any time that fox\nnews is telling me something is true i am inclined to think it is not\ntrue based on their past history can i get an \"amen\" on\nthat applause hoots]\n\n\n\nit is\na little bit disturbing when you start watching bill o'reilly and\nglenn beck and they are saying exactly the same things as all your\nfavorite conspiracy websites that is not good that is not what we\nwant because fox is a corporate entity it is a propaganda organ it is also\nimportant to understand that many of the conspiracy sites have been\nseeded with propaganda these are not independent bloggers that are\nactually trying to raise money and do an honest living these are\npeople that are funded by the pentagon and the nsa we have had\nextensive discussions with people about this who are insiders so\nwhat is happening now is that because as a planet we have not loved\nourselves \u2013 we have been stuck in this self-loathing and this\nself-condemnation and this fear of our own potential this fear of\nour power \u2013 the universe has not sent us these majestic loving cosmic leaders who are all-knowing and all-powerful and can\nbe trusted with the warmth and innocence of a young child they\nhave sent us vicious killers who will do nothing but spare no expense\nto rape us to steal every cent of our money that is what happens in\nthe universe but it only happens until you do not need the lesson if you\nlearn to love yourself do those negative people still get fixated\ninto your life to such an extent that that is all you ever have no if\nyou are one of these people who has been through self-loathing and\nmoved into a positive self-concept and self-esteem if you have\nlearned the power of \"no as opposed to the power of\n\u201cnow and you can say \"no\" to somebody trying\nto manipulate you then all of sudden you are not shackled to this\nfeeling of obligation to someone who is being grotesquely unfair you\nnow have the wherewithal to speak your mind to say your piece to\nget your needs met even if it means that it is going to upset\nsomeone because if someone has denied you the respect and the\nsovereignty and love that you deserve as a perfect child of god then\nyou deserve to protect yourself from that person you\ndeserve to love yourself enough that you claim your right to exist the\nuniverse sees that you have learned your lesson now the people that\nwould have taken away your freedom and would have taken away your\nsovereignty can no longer do so because even one flicker of light\nin the darkness is enough to show you the layout of the room we have had\nenough of that now that there is a massive awakening going on project\ncamelot \u2013 and i was a part of this \u2013 happened to get\ninvolved in the center of this swine flu vaccination conspiracy we\nhad a situation unfold onstage in z\u00fcrich between myself and\nanother witness who was arguing in favor of vaccinations and is\nactually a former operative for majestic which is the ufo working\ngroup arm of the neoconservative republican new world order faction\nof the world elite so he is telling you you should get the\nvaccine now granted there is a\ngreat deal of science to suggest that vaccines do confer immunity we\nare not disagreeing with that but\nwe are also considering the testimony of people like jane\nburgermeister a well-known mainstream journalist who happened to go\nalternative when she started to find out that baxter pharmaceuticals as you all know had released a vaccine and  thank god  these\npeople in norway injected it into some rats\nbefore they gave it to people and the rats\nall got bird flu and died oops how did that happen giggles for\neffect] i do not know how that\nhappened did we do that no of course not so\nlook you also have people in the government who are not high enough\nto know that this swine flu thing might have been manufactured and\nthey have a very legitimate concern about the swine flu it is\nbeing kept secret but they do believe that this could mutate like it\ndid in 1918 which you get sick the first time it is not that bad but when you get sick the second time and everybody is dying \nmillions of people are dying that is the theory let us\nbear in mind that in 1918 the world was nowhere near as civilized as\nit is now sanitation was much less in order for you to have any of\nthese flu regardless of what they\nare get your health down in a negative way your immune system has\nto be depleted what is the\nbiggest thing in this new science i am going to teach you about that\ndepletes your immune system negative thoughts so if they can keep you in fear which means that you hate the\ngovernment you hate the president you hate what is happening to your\nkids in school you hate the economy you hate the federal reserve if you are angry and you are fearful all the time and then they stick\nout a little virus guess what happens to you you get the virus a\nvirus is a frequency-based entity as you see in my 2012\nenigma video polio rubella all\nthese various viruses have geometric structure which is wave\nparticle structure geometry can flip around into the time field and\nbecome a wave budakovski which you are going to see in this presentation proved that the wave\nstructure of a disease is enough to infect healthy tissue in a\nhermetically sealed container you can take the wave structure of a\ndisease zap it through a hermetically sealed container and have\nthose cells inside the container catch the disease a\ndisease is a disease of the mind which has as its medium of\ntransference the consciousness field that is how you get sick it is\nby going out of integrity the nutritional component is secondary to\nthat when\nyou are in an area where everybody is depressed because their living\nconditions are very difficult they are going to get sick a lot more because they are so negative so i ask you this if you can respect yourself enough to no longer let\nthese people into your life on a personal level is there a hundredth\nmonkey effect that happens to the planet of course of course that is what is happening right now what i\nsaid on this panel last night what i said on the radio show that i\njust did with project camelot on thursday what i am preparing to say\non my website is that we are now at a point where we have graduated i was told\nthis a year ago i was actually starting to be told this two years\nago it is now happened we have\ngraduated from the need to have the new world order running the show it is over it is going to be over within less than a year i am not\ntrying to be psychic i am talking in facts i am talking about the\nsimple fact that you cannot lie to people who know the truth what does\na lie require to exist it requires an absence of information it\nrequires you not knowing that it is a lie because if you are being\nlied to and you know that it is a lie then it is not a lie it becomes\nan obvious ridiculous gaff that this person is making it becomes a\nsituation that can be remedied because you can start laughing when\nthat person tells you a lie because you know the truth we\nare watching the derivatives system the ponzi scheme and\ninternational bankers being ripped apart because the other countries\nare tired of playing the game they now have more economic power than\nthe old european white men that run the new world order and the\nilluminati \u2013 they no longer have the leverage to be able to do\nwhat they are doing what i\npropose to you on an even more intrinsic level is that this is all\nsomething that appears to be happening as a result of natural\nprogressions of events but\non another level it is an energetic phenomenon which is being\nprogrammed to occur by a movement into a higher energetic frequency that frequency is making us more present with ourselves the best\nthing you can do for the planet the best thing you can do to save\nthe children to avoid the swine flu to protect yourself and your\nfinances and to make a better world for future generations is to\nstay in that state of positive uplifting peace and gratitude can i\nget an \"amen\" on that thank you and i\ndo not profess that i am the guy you go to for the answers you can\nsend me your emails i am happy to read them i read all my emails but\nthis is something that each of us are doing i have only identified an\neffect that is happening to everyone if you want to go religious for\na minute the second coming of the christ or the messianic return is something that is happening to everyone i\nwas talking to jordan  over dinner with bill and kerry the\nother night and he was telling me that if you really go back into\nthe original old testament documentation that the messianic figure\nis not one person it represents this change into a whole new way of\nbeing so now he is got me convinced that i have got to go looking for that data\nmyself he has reason to believe it is true and i am sure he is right but i need to find my own facts i do not wait for somebody else to\ncome and teach me something if i hear something that i like i go\nlook and i find out for myself i\nwas told from my own guidance which is dreams and visions and\nprophetic information that there was going to be a great change\nhappening to the earth and the solar system i did not just nod my\nhead like a subservient slave to some higher power and say yes you are right you are right oh lovely master i will do what you say i\nsaid no i cannot believe that i\ncannot believe that the whole world is going to change on an energetic\nlevel that will make what we are in now seem like the most miserable\ndepression by comparison that the life that we have now will become\n100 times more harmonious in which things like instantaneous\ntelepathy levitation telekinesis healing and flying are so\neffortless that it is as easy to do as raising and lowering the\ndiaphragm to make your lungs breathe it requires no extra effort that\nseems to be what is going on there is all these people that we have in\nearth's history from a variety of cultures - including jesus and if\nyou do not want to believe in jesus really existing there is plenty of\nother cultures you can go to look for so-called ascended masters they are out there guys that have these abilities guys that do these\namazing things all\nthat represents is somebody who is a little bit farther ahead than\nyou are not too much we know\nthat the ets that are visiting us are almost entirely human the\nwidest divergence from a human look that you are ever going to get is\nthe so-called gray the\nmajority of humans - and we are getting more and more whistleblowers\ncoming forward and telling us the same thing the ets are our family they look like us they have similar types of voices that we do although they may not use them anymore because telepathy works much\nbetter and much faster this\n\nis like a dial-up modem it sucks okay if i could telepathically speak to you pfft sorry blows\ngently into mic] foo  how is that if\ni could telepathically speak to you and just give you the download boom you had just get the whole thing and i can walk off thank\nyou very much good night and i am\ndone it is\nalready happening is not it i am giving you holographic plates what\ndo we know about a holographic plate you cut it up into little\npieces you shine lasers into each one of those pieces and what\nhappens do you see one side of the hologram you see the whole\nhologram just maybe just a little bit dimmer so what\ni am doing is i am giving you all these little pieces which seem to be\nvery interdisciplinary i am talking about diet i am talking about\nhealth i am talking about politics i am talking about science but i am\ntalking about the same thing i am talking about you what\nis your identity what is your identity is\nit your body no is it this room around you right now that is part\nof it your body is part of it the people sitting next to you in\nthis auditorium or if you are watching this on the internet the\ncomputer screen that you are looking at  that is part of you the\nchair that is touching your bottom is part of you it is your identity when you walk on the ground the ground and the earth is also walking\nagainst you not just you walking against the ground when you\ngo outside and you see the blue skies and you see the clouds and\nyou see the birds and you see the trees and you hear the wind\nblowing through the trees that is you that is who you are energetically\nwe can prove that energetically we can prove that all the cells in\nyour body change every seven years who you are right now this body\nthat you have even if you have this big nasty wart on your face or\nsomething that wart has been completely re-done over seven years of\ntime okay fine what does that mean that means that the energy that made you\nchange every seven years flowed through you but it did not get stuck\nthere it kept on going is\nit not true that the air that you are breathing right now as i talk to\nyou has potentially been shared by every person in human history that is pretty nasty if you are a germophobe\nperson is not it every\nperson in the world's history has breathed the air that you are\nbreathing it is going around and around and around and around it may\nbe getting cleaned but all the energy is there and you can trace it\nback that can be scientifically proven easily so\nwhat about you who are you who are you really if the energy field\nthat makes your consciousness is interpenetrated with other peoples consciousness and we can prove that then who are you are you\njust this ego are you just this part of yourself that feels like\nyou are lacking something because\nthe body needs things to survive the body needs sanitation if you\ndo not shower it for a while it is going to start smelling pretty\nnasty if you do not go to the bathroom you are going to get sick and\nyou will eventually die if\nyou do not eat something you are going to starve to death if you\ndo not drink something you are going to dehydrate to death the\nbody is fragile it can be cut it can be having broken bones you\ncan have hair loss skin problems everything\ncan go wrong with the body and therefore when the body feels pain you feel pain and it seems like your identity is now in jeopardy\nbecause the body is so identified with the identity we assume our\nidentity is the body but we now have the scientific proof that\nthat is not true so\nyour identity ultimately is the earth \u2013 the\ngaia hypothesis james lovelock your\nidentity ultimately is the sun \u2013 that which created all the\nparticles and molecules that make you who you are now your\nidentity is the galaxy your identity is the universe the energy\nthat makes the universal mind is you \u2013 it is just in a slower holographically fragmented form like that prism i said is rotating\nand all these little rainbows are there that is all it is that is all\nyou are but that is everything you need to be because that proves that you are\nthe light you are the love you are the one infinite creator that is\nall you ever have been that is all you ever will be and that is more\nthan enough because what that means is that you have limitless\npotential there is\nnothing special about me the only thing that is different is that\ni am very dedicated to doing what i am doing and i am getting in touch\nwith that part of myself that has access to the higher consciousness and it makes me more and more an embodiment of who i am the\nmore that you get in touch with the higher self with your true\ncosmic identity the more that you become one of the living master\ngeniuses on this planet if\nyou had any idea of the scope of what you could be if you truly\naccess your potential it would floor you because every single one of\nus has the potential to be a messianic figure to be the savior of\nthe world we all\nhave that potential and we are all doing it to varying degrees as we\nstart awakening well thank you look i\ncould yak about this all day but we have got a lot of slides to do so\nlet us do some slides slide\nreads interplanetary climate change nasa's hottest secret the\ngalaxy is pumping out these waves of energy which are now changing\nthe solar system and we are going to talk about that in very concrete\nterms you are going to see all the proof for that the\nfossil record is undergoing 26-million-year cycles as well as\n62-million-year cycles as you see in this graph here what is causing\nthat to happen all life on earth spontaneously changing in even\nintervals of time oh it is got to be some big rock out there that is spinning around 62\nmillion years is not some big rock that is like a third of the orbit\nof the entire galaxy basically it is about a fourth because the\ngalaxy is about a 240-million-year orbit 62 is about roughly\nspeaking it is a quarter it might be exactly a quarter that might\nbe the point what did\nthe ancients know and why must we remember now what do pyramids\nreally do pyramids are harnessing the source field we are going to\nget into that in a minute we know and we can prove now that atlantean civilization was nothing new these pyramids around the world are not something that was built in\nconventional history it was built before then off\nthe western tip of cuba as you see in this map here at this c\nguanahacabibes - i cannot even pronounce\nthat - the guanahacabibes peninsula right off the tip of that on the\nwestern tip of cuba you go a mile down well so it is not quite a\nmile but it is a long ways down under the surface of the ocean and\ndown there you find a submerged city as this link says on bbc news this\nis the only officially-released side scan sonar photograph of what\nwas actually seen down there does that look like random pieces of\nsand on the sea floor no this\nis what it actually looks like if you reconstruct it in a computer that is a computer graphic rendering of what you just saw right here is everybody with me that is not something that just showed up as a\nresult of random geologic processes that is a human-built structure this area\ncould not have been above the ground and above sea level prior to\n11,000 years ago paulina\nzelitsky is here in a cave in cuba which used to be the atlantean highlands looking at inscriptions on\nthe cave wall they are precisely the same as inscriptions that they\nsaw being painted on the walls of these submerged cities that they\nsent submersible submarines probes into what\nyou are seeing here is a diagram of the energy fields in the solar\nsystem which are of course concentric rings emanating out from the\ncenter of the sun they also\nsaw these cross formations painted on inscriptions in these submerged\ncities now\nhere is the only other photograph that she is ever released this is a\nstill-frame from a much longer film where she is flying a submersible\nthrough this city what do\nyou see in the window of her monitor would you like to see it more\nup close that is not\njust a little piece of sand on the bottom of the ocean that is a\npyramid would you like to see a pyramid in egypt that it looks very\nsimilar to here\nwe go this is called the bent pyramid of dahshur on the right it is\nalmost identical to what you see on the left and that is submerged\noff the western tip of cuba it is down\nthere right now what are we doing by not going and looking at it why\ndid they sell this story to national\ngeographic and it just so happened\nto never make it out in 2003 national\ngeographic did a 360-degree\ncontract they bought all the rights it was supposed to be the\nbiggest thing ever to come out in 2003 and guess what happened pfft nothing well what we have now is evidence that somebody out there who is\nresponsible for building this seal into the dollar knew that these\npyramids harnessed some sort of energy field because what you are\nseeing is clearly an energetic non-physical structure going down on\nto the top of the pyramid here slide\nreads do ancient sites harness 'energy this\ngrants the next question i talked about the time field i talked\nabout the russians is there a technology in which you can build\nsomething that will take this natural energy that makes physical\nmatter that is flowing through everything and harness that energy in\na given direction the answer is \u201cyes you are\ngoing to have some fun now you are going to get to look at some\nthings that are already well known to exist and i am going to let you\njust think about them the\nfirst is menhirs which are standing stones i want you to bear in mind that the height\nof a human being is only a little bit taller than where the top of\nwhere the shadow is in this photograph these are enormous enormous\nstones do you\nthink that maybe these enormously tall stones were built for a\nreason do you think that maybe these ancient peoples were putting\nthem there because they got something out of it is it merely a\nreligious symbol or was it put there because it had a technological\nusefulness do they\nput these headstones over your grave because it is just decorative or\nare they hoping that the headstone is going to have some sort of\nenergetic effect that will keep your body preserved and usher you on\ninto the afterlife can\nthese stones actually create ripples of energy that will raise our\nfrequency of consciousness that will make us feel better that will\nmake us healthier that will make everything around us more\nharmonious if you\nthink about the possibility that these stones could be put in the\nposition and change the way that your mind works then you are\nthinking in the right direction they are\nenormous and it would be a lot of work to do that just for some\nreligious symbolism it would be much more apropos\nto believe that people would go to all this trouble if they could use\nit for something the\nnext thing we are going to look at is dolmens these are stone cellars what\nif you were able to build a little stone cellar a little stone\nstructure get inside of it and have it harness energy so that while\nyou are sitting in there you meditate and it raises your vibration it\nraises the consciousness frequency of your mind while you are inside\nand all you have to do is sit under this absolutely colossal stone\nthat if it fell would crush you flat instantaneously very precariously this\nis kilclooney in ireland look at that thing look at how that\ngigantic stone that weighs more than two 18-wheelers at least if\nnot much more if that little guy were to just fall off of the tips\nof the other stones he would crush you flat and yet there he is and with all the earthquakes and with all the earth changes that have\ngone on it is still balanced precariously right up there here's\nanother one balanced precariously why would they go to so much\ntrouble do you really think a bunch of guys are just going to do\nthis because it is cool do you really think they would go to the\ntrouble of getting themselves crushed in trying to precariously\nbalance these very very massive stones just because it is a fun thing\nto do i do not think so in this\ncase you see that actually part of the stone has broken off and\nfallen onto the ground but the point is the same the point is look\nat what is going on there you go underneath you meditate and you get\ncharged up now this\nis an example of a more advanced structure where a wall is built\naround you once you go inside that wall you now have a much much\nhigher energetic charge and you have got a little breathing hole this is\nanother one from the side someone\nin the audience asks for the location of the photos]\n\n\nah you would not you like to know no actually i did this in a rush and i\ndo not know where all these locations are but it is easy to find\nonline just look for dolmens and you will start to find them go to\ngoogle pictures google images google dolmen the word dolmen d-o-l-m-e-n you will start finding these things barrows\nis the next thing barrows are mounds the idea here is that you\nactually drill a hole into the ground underneath the mound there is\na round chamber inside the mound - this is well known - you go in\nthere and you have a little party and you meditate it is enough now\nthat you can bring in a group of people it\ndoes the same thing as a dolmen except you are burrowing into the\nearth now so here's some barrows and this one of course you see\nhow well-structured it is silbury hill being the biggest one now here the entrance is of course the english government has been\nkind enough to put iron bars in front of it so you cannot go in there they do not want you to be able to use this technology anymore and\nthey are probably worried about finding condoms and stuff inside frankly but that is not what it is built for necessarily maybe it was some\nof these barrows are longer and you also have the mound builders in\nthe us you have all these other things like serpent mound in ohio\nthat you can go to and see this in the us i am only doing the english\nones right now henges\nis the one that everybody is so familiar with and everybody loves because now you get standing stones like the single ones you were\nseeing before except now there are certain areas where the energetics\nare so high that long rows of stones are being put together because\nit is going to be even more powerful the sheep\nreally like being near these stones in fact animal life really can\nfeel this more than we can these were\nnot put there by accident and again in this case you have a\ncombination of a barrow and a henge you have the henge at the front here and if you go through that path down the middle you go into\nthe barrow and you go inside and you meditate maybe the\nhenge in the front helps focus the energy that is flowing through the\ncenter of the barrow here's\nanother henge out there just hanging out in the middle of the\nenglish countryside some of them are in france some of them are in\ngermany they are in ireland too they are all over the place here's\nanother one here's\nanother one here's another example one of the\nmost impressive which unfortunately has been lost to the ravages of\ntime to a large degree is avebury now what you are going to see\nhere if you look closely is that all of these different stones all\nof these different little dots that you see as you go along here represent individual stones this\nlooks like a giant serpent here's the head and here's what it is\neaten in its stomach if you look up at the top in the middle\nthere there is two little rings of stones inside that represents the\nmeal and then here's the tail down at the bottom down\nhere is one of the barrows this is silbury hill the best barrow of\nall the most famous one and the most well-structured one look at\nthe geometry look at how it is a perfect equilateral triangle between\nthe head of the snake the tail of the snake silbury in the middle and then here's the area up here now\nwhat this was for this was a gigantic technology this is a machine it is a machine built based on as you look around it the contours\nof the mountains the contours of the land so that a bunch of people\nget inside this area right here and they have a big party and they\nall meditate and chant and run around and do fun stuff and they are\nchanging consciousness for themselves and for the planet that is\nwhat this stuff was built for it is a consciousness technology of\ncourse stonehenge being the greatest example of all these sarsen\nstones as they are called are gigantic in size and very beautiful to\nlook at what\nyou may not realize is that at one time there was a whole ring of\nthem like this that is what it used to look like all\nthe stones that have fallen have been identified in the soil because\nthe more they fall down over time the more that it rains each year they fall further and further into the ground but they have all been\nfound so this is known to be true i am not making this up what\nwe know is that stonehenge was used to identify solstices and when\nthe moon and the sun were traveling and what would happen because\nduring certain planetary alignments certain times of the year these\nzones on the earth became much more energetically active are\nthese ancient structures connected the answer is \u201cyes through the science of ley lines this was done by sir alfred watkins\nand we are going to talk a little bit about him he\nfound in the 1920s that ancient holy sites lined up in straight\nlines which he called leys sites from extremely different ages millennia apart were all\naligned with one another this includes the neolithic age (which is\nthe stone age the bronze age the iron age and the christian era now he\nwould use this camera to basically be able to look across long\ndistances and see if things were in a straight line what you see\nhere is the summary of the massive amount of research that he did what you see here is every single one of these words is a different\nancient sacred site nobody\never comes out in the open and says oh by the way all these sacred sites are built in a straight line it took a guy like alfred watkins to analyze this and discover it for\nhimself but\nguess what a lot of these things are they are cathedrals do you\nthink that maybe the knight templars knew that there was something\ngoing on hm do you think that maybe they knew to build on that line\nand not to build off the line do you\nthink that maybe if you build a church which acts as a funnel for\nthis consciousness energy that if you build that domed roof for the\nchurch out of stone over that line that it is going to harness more\nof this energy field from the universe and that in so doing it is\ngoing to become a resonator so that when you go to church you are\ngoing to be experiencing a revelation a higher consciousness do you\nthink that maybe the stained glass window and the gregorian chant\nmusic are creating harmonics that help you harmonize with the field absolutely so here's\nsome people from his stonehenge club the straight track club as it\nwas called the ley line hunters here is a\nbarrow that had trees growing around it here\nis a similar ring of trees without a barrow this is a natural earth\neffect caused by these energy fields because they do have circular\nformations well it is a hyperdimensional effect these are\nharnessing hyperdimensional energy because the hyperdimensional\nenergy is what makes the matter that is building the stones let\nme say that again the matter that makes these stones the stone\nitself the actual hard stuff is built from hyperdimensional energy energy from the time field that is flowing into our space-time that is\nwhat according to dr dewey larson all matter is built from is this\nhyperdimensional exchange between three-dimensional time and\nthree-dimensional space that is all it is so\nof course you are going to get time anomalies but it is also the\nenergy that builds you it builds your dna it builds your body so\nwhen you get more of it flowing through you you are going to have\nmore health and vitality because\nit is the energy of your consciousness because it is consciousness it is also going to give you a more advanced intellect so the way that we can actually prove that this global grid these\nenergy lines has a hyperdimensional effect that can completely pull\nyou out of our three-space of length width and height  the\nthree-dimensional world  is with the research of ivan sanderson he\ninvestigated a massive number of different disappearances of ships\nand airplanes what he did is he took everything from the dawn of\naviation going all the way back to the first airplanes and even\nbefore that for the marine records he looked for every case of\ndisappearance since planes were discovered he\nfound that the majority of what he was finding all clustered around\ntwelve points on the earth's surface that is completely\nunprecedented that is not mainstream information it was done in the\n1960s this guy\nshould have been treated with as much respect as somebody like edison\nor einstein or alexander graham bell or the wright brothers because\nthis is a huge discovery twelve key points around the world in which\nplanes and ships are spontaneously disappearing he\ndid not have anything in mind when he started doing this all he did\nis he looked up each one and he gave it a push-pin push-pin push-pin and where were all the push-pins at the end they were in\ntwelve places even\nstranger is that the twelve places are not just haphazardly scattered\naround the earth \u2013 they are all equally distant from each other they are harmonically balanced with one another they are all the same\ndistance apart when you look to the ones that are adjacent to each\nother if you\nconnect the dots you get a sacred geometry which happens to be the\nsame geometry that is in the polio virus the same geometry that is in\nmany other viruses at the quantum level including hiv but\nit is not just a negative toxic thing like viruses it is a very\npositive thing that is the fundamental building block of physical\nmatter and biology and life it is an icosahedron now here we go this is the bermuda triangle obviously you know about\nthis one believe me when i tell you that there are many many\nairplane disappearances that cannot be explained where they have never\nfound an oil slick or flotsam on the surface of the water all they\nfind is missing plane it is\non the radar one minute and it is gone the next there is no oil\nslick there is no wreckage nothing and they do not find anything on\nthe surface on the bottom of the ocean floor either it is gone what\nhappened is it is passing through a portal it is passing through a\ntime gate \u2013 a gate into another frequency of reality a\nparallel universe in which time is three dimensional here\nare the twelve points that he discovered with his push-pins referring to slide ivan sanderson's\nvile vortices - showing a world map\nwith triangles in a pattern] take a close look you\nsee the bermuda triangle off the coast of florida you see another\none near brazil in south america you see another one here on the\nland in africa another one down here by sri lanka you see one\nthat is the himalayan mountains all that crazy stuff like the\nmaster and teachings of the far east [life\nand teaching of the masters of the far east tibet all that stuff up there you have\ngot some that are out in the middle of the pacific ocean here which\nis a real lonely area to get stuck in the easter islands is down\nhere then you got one here which is the devil's triangle that is\nofficially been declared a disaster area by the japanese government they do not allow you to fly or sail through this area you\nalso have two bracketing australia and that is very important australia if you notice is the only continent that is completely\npinned between  actually four because\nwhat he does not show you on this map is that there is one down here on\nthe south pole one up here on the north pole so you have got one two three four australia is geometrically perfectly in the\ncenter of four of the most important nodes so there is a lot of crazy\nstuff and the\nexact geometric center of the nodes happens to be right where pine\ngap is which is one of the biggest bases where all this stuff is\nbeing done you\nconnect the dots together you get your icosahedron which you see\nhere on the left is the geometry this is what it looks like\nsuperimposed over the earth's surface on the right next\nslide]\n\n\nnow this is where it gets even more interesting these three russian\nscientists and everybody laughs when i say their names goncharov morozov and makarov [nicolai goncharov vyachelslav morozov valery makarov] see you are not laughing\nbecause i told you it is not cool to laugh so like now you do not\nwant to laugh what\nthey did is they went through and they looked at every single line\nthat was discovered by sir alfred watkins remember the guy that did\nthe ley lines we were just talking about that how all these\nchurches and all these neolithic sites and iron age sites and bronze\nage sites they are all in straight lines well\nthese russian dudes took every single one of those things that alfred\nwatkins discovered and they took every single other structure they\ncould find around the world - the great pyramid stonehenge easter\nisland temples and pagodas in asia china japan they\nlooked at every single weird monolithic (which means big stone\nstructure they could find anywhere in the world and they found that\nevery single one of them fit onto a single grid which was very simple\nto construct all\nyou had to do is start with the same twelve points that ivan\nsanderson found where these matter time-space warps would happen take those twelve points connect the dots just like i did that is\nthe icosahedron but then the icosahedron has a curious property it is a geometry that because it is perfect can be inverted it is a mathematical thing\nyou can do where you flip the geometry inside-out literally that is\nwhat it would be if you add the structure like made out of wires you could actually flip it inside-out and rebuild it but build it\nbackwards build the geometric inverse of it all you have\ngot to do is inverse the icosahedron and make it so that it fits\ntogether with the original icosahedron and you get this grid here it\nis so i want to point out to you again because this is a little bit\nconfusing if you do not know what you are looking at that all of your\noriginal points are still there here's the bermuda triangle here's\nthe one on the southern tip here's the two that i was talking about\naround australia the one that is up there here is the one at the\nsouth pole so they are all still there but now you have added in the\ngeometric opposite if\nyou simply build this geometry you now have a diagram that shows you\nwhere every single ancient site in the entire world has been\nconstructed on over 4,000 they could not find a single one that was\nanything impressive that was not built on this grid why do you think\nthat is if\nyou have a wire that is going to go to something that powers an\nelectrical appliance are you going to put the wire under your armpit\nand expect that it is going to work no you plug it into the wall if you\nbuild a pyramid and you do not build it on this grid do you think\nthat it is going to work not anywhere near as good you have\ngot to build it where the energy is that is why with these cold\nfusion guys they are looking at the cold fusion reactions they build\ndevices that actually work in some places but then they bring it\nsomewhere else it does not work anymore it is\non 60 minutes they talked about this well we\ndo not understand oh it must not work then the scientists say well the\nwhole technology is wrong no it is because if you are on the grid it is going to work it is\nvery simple let us put all of the cold fusion devices on the grid\nwhere they work then we will wire them up and we are done just build\nit where it needs to go it is very\nsimple you have energy in one place and it is not somewhere else it\nhappens to be the energy of the time field well look\nat what else you got here you got the mid-atlantic ridge this is\nthe volcanic ridge that defines what is pushing apart the two\ncontinents if\nyou start looking at the next grid which is the becker-hagens grid they have basically taken the same thing the black dots are ivan\nsanderson\u2019s twelve vortexes again all the matter-time-space\nwarping going on there you have all the points of the geometric\ninverse of the icosahedron but\nwhat they do is they actually take two icosahedrons and they put one\nout of phase with the other rather than inverting it they just take\na second icosahedron and make it a little bit out of phase we\nhave a phone ringing that is a sign do you guys need a break no see we are having mutiny kerry what should\nwe do the troops do not know what to do david\nlistens as kerry speaks offstage]\n\n\nokay all\nright we will do a short meditation and mentally clear the room that is why we got the cell phone ringing and distracting me i\nwould ask that you just take a couple minutes take a nice deep\nbreath now if you need to use the restroom please go because this\nis going to be enough time that you can actually have a break if you\nneed one i will not be offended i promise some\nof you are hardcore and are just going to sit through this that is\ncool either way is fine i will not judge you we will just laugh about\nyou once you are out of the room i will make jokes about you let us go\ninto the infinite peace of this moment you may want to close your\neyes you may want to spend a little time relaxing just give\nyourself over to the loving presence of the cosmos let yourself feel\nthe articulations of intelligent infinity which speak to you in the\nmoments between moments give\nyourself an opportunity to relax into the full awareness of who you\nare take comfort in the beauty of you take pleasure in the divine\nenergy that makes you who you are as\nyou tune in deeper and deeper to yourself you become a pyramid you\nbecome a standing stone you become a lens of light for cosmic energy\nto flow through it does not\nrequire you to spend any money it does not require you to have any\nadvanced degree or university education it does not require you to\ndrink anything eat anything take any pill smoke anything all\nit requires is peace all it requires is tranquility all it requires\nis the knowingness that you are more than your physical body that\nyou are a divine light a glorious gift from the cosmos that\nany and all negativity that has hung around you can be cleansed away\nmuch like a traditional housewife would sweep out the house with a\nbroom with all the doors open the dust comes flying out the floors\nbecome clean it becomes\neasier and easier to walk around undisturbed to appreciate the\nbounty of your own space the bounty of your own sovereign identity for\nwhen you learn to love yourself you can have those boundaries you\ncan sweep out the dust in your own life as we are now doing on the\nplanet the\nvery air that passes through your lungs is the living conduit of\nuniversal light that carries you like a magic carpet to lands unseen\nthat float in the sky lands that are beyond physicality you have\nevery opportunity to reach out and find those lands you\nhave the glory of being yourself in this moment you have an\nopportunity to expand your awareness so that that mind that thinks\nthrough the hardware of the brain is not just the mind of your\npersonal ego but the universal mind that is much more than just your\nown personal self it\nis the self with a capital s let us experience that self because as\nyou do the energy flows through you and it is an energy that creates\nan impenetrable shield that no negativity can penetrate it\nis a living vessel of light the chalice of the holy grail that\nallows you to be perfectly sovereign in mind and in body and in\nspirit by living through that consciousness you live in the\npresence of your everlasting awareness your eternal identity which\nis never going to be terminated by the loss of a body it is much\nmore than that your mind\nis information and the information has identity and the identity is\nthe universe so now i\nwill start to bring you back into the conscious mind most of our\nfriends have gone to the bathroom now so we are all back in the room i had\nlike you to see again this grid open your eyes and let us meditate on\nthat grid for a minute you are seeing the underlying geometric\nframework of the mind of the earth this is how it has been built and\nthis is what structures the continents the way they are look at\nhow the coast of rio de janeiro is pushed in by this node look at\nhow the whole shape of south america is defined by the lines that\nsurround it there is many many examples of this this is\nthe stretching pattern that the earth makes as it expands you can\nsee island chains that are part of circles here is another island\nchain that is part of a larger circle just\nconnect those nodes together look at the two points in the middle it looks like cell mitosis that is not an accident listening\nand responding to someone talking to david] oh really well that is\ninteresting i was just informed that there was a ufo sighting right\noutside the building at the time that the cell phone went off david\nlaughs audience responds] believe it or not but ah that is pretty\ncool well thank you guys for showing up actually there is a whole bunch of\nthem on the ceiling here cool all right hopefully you are a little bit less hypnotized now and\nwe will get back into enough of a thinking mind that you can follow me we\nproved the ancient sites harnessed useable energy the russian\npyramid research holds the key the russians after the fall of the\niron curtain had all of their military-industrial complex all of\ntheir infrastructure and they had the laboratories available to be\nable to build pyramids and study what they would do and that is what\nthey did here\nare actual photographs of the russian pyramids check this out these\nare enormous these are little bitty those little dots down there those are people okay so look at that look at the size of that\nthing here is\nsomebody posing in front of it here's what it looks like on the\ninside it is made of pvc plastic pipes with a fiberglass facing sometimes\nthey are built near oil fields as you can see here sometimes they\nwere built out in the countryside that is a smaller one here he is\nposing in front of it now some very very strange things happened when they did this they\nbuilt one over an oil well it would become 25% more productive and\nthe oil that came out was 25% purer it\nwould make poisonous chemicals no longer poisonous to the body they\nwould become safe enough that you could dump it on your skin or drink\nit and you were fine i do not recommend that you try this okay but\nthat is what they said they found diseases\nwould be cured even cancer it is an energetic phenomenon they\nhad white under-bred mice and they injected them with a toxin that\nwould normally destroy them if 60 % of the mice died from the toxin\nin the laboratory when they put those same mice under the pyramid guess how many of them died only 6 so 94% of all the mice injected\nwith a lethal toxin that were put in the pyramids that they built\nhere that you just saw did not die up\nto 400% increase in the productivity of agricultural seeds you throw\nthese seeds into the pyramid guess what happens you grow the same\nplants but now they are 400% larger and they have got better fruit everything is better about them so you can grow super-seeds strong\nelectrical activity you can put a little voltage pile a little\nbattery on top of the pyramid and it generates current it is\nfascinating significant\nearthquake reduction this is where you start seeing how the earth's\nenergy fields are related to severe weather and severe earth changes if you\nbuild these pyramids then guess what happens with earthquakes you\ndo not get a big giant quake anymore you get a bunch of little ones\nthat do not cause any damage you also\nsee an enormous column of energy hundreds of miles wide around the\npyramid this is not electromagnetic energy this is the energy which\nthe russians can measure which they call torsion fields or the time\nfield that\nenergy column that hundreds-of-miles-wide energy column from one\npyramid is enough to cause big storm fronts coming through to kind of\ngo around it like there is a big circle there they just wroop they\ngo around it it is crazy it is been proven what\nthey also did is they took giant slabs of granite that they were\ngoing to use to build these jail cells in russia - that is a lot\nbetter than an american jail cell is not it they\ntake these granite slabs and they built 5,000 prisoners cells from\nthese granite slabs and they watched these guys they did not do\nanything else to their environment they did not do anything else to\ntheir diet or their medication now one could argue well maybe the prisoners were really happy that\nthey had a nice granite cell that they could hang out in but that is\nnot enough to explain what happened because they had a profound\nimprovement in their attitude and behavior including substantial\nincrease in addiction recovery from alcoholism and drug abuse so all these prisoners that are living in these jail cells that were\ncharged up with granite from the pyramid and that is all that it\nwas all their behavior starts improving because they are living\ninside a harmonic resonating chamber the granite crystals have\nactually changed their structure if\nyou think about how you magnetize an iron nail you take a piece of\niron right like a nail and you start stroking it with a magnet the more that you do that eventually it becomes magnetized and you\ncan pick things up with it well we\nknow that the reason why that works is that all the molecules in the\niron are now going north to south in their electrical charge in the\nsame direction that is what starts to cause it to happen so\nwe know that you can do it to metal you do not see anything different\nabout the nail but we know that it becomes magnetic because the\natoms are changing inside the\npyramid does the same thing to crystals you put the granite crystals\ninside the crystals change i\ndo not have it in the slide show here but another thing they did was\njust to take a bunch of granite rocks and just throw them all over\nthe floor and leave them there what they found was that if they\ncame back after a few months - the granite is usually a reddish color\n- they came back after a few months and there were rings in the rocks\nthey had just thrown on the ground and the rings were white-ish the\ngranite changed color it actually changed from a reddish color to a\nwhite-ish color in a ring that is how much these fields change\ncrystals and their actual structure when\nyou get to the point of earthquakes and how earthquakes can be\nchanged and reduced by the pyramids and how human behavior is\nimproved by the pyramids \u2013 you just put the prisoners in those\ngranite cells and they get much better \u2013 this proves that our\nconsciousness is tethered to the earth's consciousness you\nharness the earth's consciousness with the pyramid that acts like a\nfunnel for this energy the energy that builds each molecule of the\npyramid is an energy that is in you so the energy that makes you who\nyou are can be harnessed in the pyramid just by the fact that it is\nshaped that way there\nis an energy that flows into every atom in that pyramid and if the\npyramid is a perfect sphere then it is going to all flow in the same\nway but if it is a funnel shape it is going to flow in with a\ndirectional current that is all it is \u2013 it is a funnel it is\nvery very simple this\nproves the connection between our consciousness and earthquakes a\nconnection between our consciousness and severe weather a strong\nlikelihood that our consciousness is directly affecting the earth that is a very important point of\ncourse the greatest pyramid of all is not surprisingly called the\n\"great pyramid we know that when you go inside the great\npyramid they have this sarcophagus that you lie in and the ancient\ntechnique was that it would cause you to have this meeting with your\nshadow a projection of your shadow you\ngo into an out-of-body consciousness and you go into this other\nrealm which is time-space as we would now call it you encounter your\nshadow projection if you can heal yourself which means if you\nembrace your shadow you\nknow the best thing you can do if you are in a nightmare and something\nis chasing you and you are terrified of it  do not keep running stop\nrunning turn around and say who are\nyou and what do you want do not be\nafraid at all get rid of the fear what\nyou will find is that if you are not afraid of it you are going to\nstart seeing it change the more that it changes the more that\nyou will see that it is yourself when you realize that it is yourself you embrace it and there is this huge flash of white light \u2013 you\nhave this amazing experience and you wake up in tears many\npeople have reported this that is the integration process the\npyramid is talking about except in the pyramid it is so powerful that\nyou literally come out with ascended abilities you literally can do\nthings that we would consider miracles such as telekinesis levitation instant healing telepathy etcetera well it is not everybody\u2019s experience napoleon went into the king's\nchamber what do you think happens to a guy like that when he spends\na night in the sarcophagus this is what he wrote after it happened he was absolutely terrified he had a\nhorrible night he never wanted to go anywhere near it again so\ni ask you this when the apple fell in front of sir isaac newton was\nthat the first time that gravity was working no it was the\nfirst time someone recognized that gravity was working is this\npresentation and the signs that we have been putting together recently\nthe first time that anybody has recognized that this is working on\nearth no right because\nwhat pyramids \u2013 global grid \u2013 everybody built it on the\ngrid why did they build it on the grid because they saw the apple\nfall they knew there was an energy field responsible for that except in this case it is not an apple falling it is a consciousness\nrising so\nhave we seen the apple fall in modern times the answer is no we are\ntrying to explain everything on electromagnetic energy and we do not\nunderstand that there is an energy beneath electromagnetic energy\nthat is even more important slide\nreads is there really a \"god\" that can be explained\nscientifically this\nreally becomes a scientific validation of the idea of a higher power that there is some divine intelligence that is more than you and me\nin separated brain-pans and there is nothing else that is there that is the old way of thinking the\nnew way of thinking is that consciousness is a field and that field\nmust exist through the whole universe because consciousness is the\nbasic behavior of matter so matter is not just in this galaxy \nit is all over the place it all seems to have all the same if not\nsimilar rules therefore consciousness is very likely to be\neverywhere slide\nreads crop circles and 2012 - messages from \"god we are\ngoing to go back into 2012 now we have built a lot of background for\nthis so let us go

called\n\"magonia what do you think a cloud ship is do you think\nthat is a cloud no think about it a cloud ship is not a cloud a cloud ship is\nsomething that they see flying in the air and they say well clouds fly in the air it is a cloud ship they\nbelieved that these cloud ships were flattening crops into circles\nbecause the cloud ships says well i am going to protect you from bad weather but here is what you need\nto do for me if i am going to protect you then you need to let me\nflatten these circles out in your crops it is kind\nof a weird deal to make with cloud ships but what the hell that is\nwhat they thought was going on agobard\nissued a prohibition against any locals taking seeds out of the crop\ncircles for pagan fertility rituals so\nwhat that means is that people were getting a bliss hit from the\nenergized crops they would build little huts out of them and stuff and they would want to have a pagan fertility ritual in them which of course means what were they doing inside the little grass hut hm i wonder that\nwas purely subconscious i have no idea what i am doing there [rubs\nhis index fingers together or i could go makes suggestive\ngesture using microphone audience laughs] no there is no subtext i am not giving you any subtext obviously what is going on is the farmers are getting really angry because\nthey are losing their crops so the farmers start

basically the equivalent of the government and they say hey look okay we have got to stop these people so agobard being also the governor basically has to issue this\nprohibition well guess what it

sun's bubble  the actual magnetic\nfield of the sun  has gotten 25% smaller the most likely\nexplanation for that is that the outside is pushing in on it there is\nsomething pushing in on it making it smaller that is what would most\nlikely be causing this which again suggests that we are moving into\nan area in the galaxy where there is a higher energetic charge we\nhave been in touch with insider

belch it off in a big\nsolar flare that is not what this about galactic\ndust there is more dust that came in between 2000-2001  300% more\nthan all the 1990s combined that is another major study that was\nfound if\nyou look at mercury mercury's magnetosphere in 2008 was much more\npowerful than it was seen in the seventies with mariner 10 here's\nthe actual mainstream publication where that came through now just recently they go back a year later and they see even more\nstuff they found magnetic tornadoes magnetic twisters and they\nsaid one of the biggest surprises was how strongly the dynamics of\nthe planet's magnetic field solar wind interaction had changed from\nthe first mercury fly-by in january 2008 so what this is telling you is that mercury has changed dramatically in\nits magnetic field in one year that is it mercury is going nuts that is the first planet in the solar system that is\nnot the only planet that is doing this look at venus 2,500% increase\nin the green glow in less than 20 years looking like this right\nhere that is totally amazing on mars\nyou have the appearance of clouds you see the clouds here that\nwere not there mars did not use to have clouds or ozone they have only\nappeared in the last 30 years or so it is another major change mainstream\nmedia has reported on global warming on mars guess what nobody's driving suvs on mars at least if they are there is\nprobably a lot less of them than there are on earth and they probably\nrun on free energy based on what our whistleblowers are telling us but\nsomething is melting the ice caps on mars jupiter\nhas this plasma torus that you could not see before 1974 and yet now\nit looks like this as time goes on the density of this torus as you\nsee here is getting 200% thicker - this is the natural saucering\nmovement that it makes as the moon io is going around its orbit well they get so bored they are ah uh stronger than expected 200%\nincrease in the whole density of this thing in basically 25 years 15 years  very very short time fifteen years every single\nparticle inside this thing gets 50 percent denser they say well it exceeded expectations okay no\nbiggie jupiter's\nwhite ovals disappeared in three years there is three of them up\nhere then you see there is two and now there is one dr phillip\nmarcus believed this would cause an 18-degree global warming on\njupiter in only a decade well guess what it is a decade later and now jupiter is having raging heat\nthunderstorms that they are calling global upheaval \u2013 just what\nhe predicted would happen these are\ninfrared heat signatures that were not there before much higher\nintensity now you\ncamera guys can you shoot either one of these because i am just\nrealizing that over here we have light on that slide and over here we\ndo not have any light so that is a better one for me to be using my\npointer on i think i am going to switch over to this one now oh somebody throw stones at the idiot here all right never\nmind let us keep going the\nstorms appeared during a dramatic planet-wide disturbance that is\nongoing on jupiter it is yet to be explained but it is changed the\ncolor of the stripes its storms are probably tied in with a global\nupheaval io's\nionosphere the moon that we were showing you before 1,000%\nhigher that is all the charged\nparticles which are coming from the sun ah it is unexpected this is\nridiculous this is our entire backyard i have showed you every\nplanet mercury's\nhaving magnetic tornadoes mercury is having so much change that in\none year it is gone nuts venus\nis having a 2,500% increase in its green glow mars is\nhaving global warming and ozone in the atmosphere and clouds that\nwere not there before now you are\ngoing out to jupiter you are seeing this plasma torus show up all\nthe particles are getting bigger there is more and more of them you\nlook at the moon io it is the same thing the ionosphere is 1,000%\nhigher the surface has gotten 200% hotter three times hotter than\nmercury how did that happen surprised oh\nyeah we cannot explain it makes\nsnoring sound] okay europa is\nmuch brighter than expected this is what they thought it would look\nlike based on what it used to look like and this is what they\nactually got look at all that light ganymede same thing 200% brighter a 1,000% increase in its density of its\natmosphere saturn's\nplasma torus 1,000% denser same thing short period of time basically twelve years aurorae\nare being seen in the polar regions of saturn here's another new\nthing that is heat that was not there before massive x-rays were seen\nfor the first time near the equator of saturn in 2004 uranus was\nas featureless as a cue ball in 1986 but look at what happens to it\nby '99 dr erich karkoschka finally has some of the childlike enthusiasm we\nreally should see these are really\nbig big changes man check it out it is incredible it is been hit\nby huge storms dude so he is\nfinally got it right makes\nsnoring sound] seasonal brightness\nchanges not well understood moving\non \nthat is the official nasa report uranus\nin 2004 is even brighter now i am going to superimpose the original\nover what you have got here look at how much this is changing all\nthat stuff is new all this bright stuff was not there before well guess what happens when you go out to neptune exactly the same\nthing this is what it looked like in 1999 this is\nwhat it looked like in 1996 zero degrees quarter rotation half\nrotation three quarter rotation doom doom doom doom doom then\nwe go up to 1998 you see that there is more brightness coming in but\nlook what happens in 2002 it is gone 40% brighter in near infrared which is just above visible light if you could see this spectrum this is what it would look like to the naked eye it is not changing\nthat much but this has only barely above what our eyes can see as\nvisible light slide\nreads 1989-2002 massive changes]\n\n\nso now i am going to show you what it looks like as it goes from '89 to\n2002 watch watch the bottom look at how much it is changing do you\nthink this is just a random thing that is being caused by the tilt of\nthe equator of the planet relative to the sun no this is a\nplanet-wide solar-system-wide effect global\nwarming on pluto 300% increase in its atmospheric pressure from '89\nto 2002 it is moving away\nfrom the sun but the surface of the planet is getting hotter as it\nmoves away from the sun which is causing the atmosphere to charge\nup so this shows us that earth changes are not unique to the earth \u2013\nthey are happening all over the place now bill\nand kerry i see you guys over there how much time do we have what\nare we on here okay well there is all sorts of different places we can stop and start in this\npresentation and i wanted to get you guys sort of like when i do\nthese longer weekends at my conferences - like i am having one in\nlondon next month - we can actually drill into this data a lot more and there is a lot more data than i actually have had time to go into\nhere but that is why i make these presentations modular but\nwhat you are seeing here is if you look through i am going to\nsummarize some of this stuff and zip a little faster so we can get\nto the punch line slide\nshows graph reads continuous rise in earthquakes]\n\n\nwe are\nseeing continuous rises in earth change activity - let me do it from\nthis side - earthquakes volcanic activity going up sea levels going\nup temperatures going up tornadoes are going up disasters natural\ndisasters economic losses on earth  all this stuff the\nentire pacific ocean sea floor is heating up which is obviously what\nhappens when the sun warms up water on the surface of the ocean then\nthose warm water particles are sinking down to the bottom where they\nwarm up the bottom of the ocean that is\nwhat the scientists are actually saying is going on so of course the next time you want to boil water and boil some eggs just get a\nhair dryer and brrrrrrr  it will work just fine i promise hm hm that is\nhow they have explained this because they cannot tell you that the\nearth is heating up from the inside that is all it is the planets\nare heating up from the inside why\nare they heating up from the inside galactic energy fields what are\nthe galactic energy fields going to do change your dna so let us\nget to that we have to\ngo through some stuff here all right we will get to this because this is good bacteria if you look in the antarctic ice in the interior of a volcano even\ninside a nuclear reactor you will find little critters they are\neverywhere they even survive in space they have been recovered after\nbeing frozen for ten million years it is\nas if some life force takes that existing body that was there and you\nthaw it out and it says oh okay that is a body i am going to make it alive so there is something going on here something more than we usually\nthink of life as being some\nbacteria thrive on infrared light they photosynthesize in near\ndarkness and they have been found miles below the surface of the\nocean floor it\nis ridiculous to think that all these critters grew from living\nbacteria from other living bacteria it becomes much more plausible\nthat those little bacteria that grew inside the nuclear reactor\ndid not come from other bacteria that grow inside nuclear reactors that are sort of floating around saying hm let me find a nuclear reactor oh look there is one no those nuclear reactors are hermetically sealed for a reason but\nthey are not sealed from the source field they are not sealed from\nthis energy that goes in there and says oh here's a place where i can make life this is like what happens in a star let\nme go ahead and jump in there and they start creating life so they call this a \u201cproblem but it is actually a proof it is a proof that life is everywhere in the universe dr chandra wickramasinghe \u2013 say that three times fast and try to\nspell it while you are pronouncing it (i have had to practice that i\nmight add has proven that the organic material in comets is\nbiological it has critters in it there're billions of comets in the\nsolar system alone and he believes that all life on earth may have\ncome here from a comet this\nis dr francis crick the co-founder of dna what he shows us is that\nit is way too complex to have evolved by random chance it is as if\nthe entire encyclopedia britannica fell out of the sky one word at a\ntime and it all happened to arrange like those monkeys on\ntypewriters that is the kind of logical idiocy that is involved to\ntry to say that dna is a darwinian mutation from random accidents bottom\nof slide reads 99.9% of all dust in the galaxy has the\nspectrographic signature of bacteria here's\nhis biggest discovery now this is the same guy who discovered dna why is not this as popular as his other discovery he looks at all the\ndust in the line of sight between where we are on earth and the\ncenter of the galaxy and all of it looks just like bacteria in its\nheat signature and its light signature exactly the same it is\nbacteria so\nthis is howard hughes worst nightmare space\nis filled with germs do not go to space if you are a germophobe even\nthe mainstream media is saying space  that creates human life\nis found in other solar systems well we know that space has these source field differences there is a\nsource field energy in space that you do not see here on earth it is\ncalled the overview effect or space euphoria astronauts go out\nthere and they get this massive energetic high from being in space it is been reported by many of them the\nchinese have taken seeds and flown them into space - and it is\nimportant that you do this in a space capsule that does not have pvc\nplastic windows and does not have aluminum in the chassis if you do\nthat which is what the nasa probes are like it does not work it\nwill not work if you have any pvc plastic at any point over the\nwindows they are not going to do this and if you have aluminum in\nthe body of the thing it is not going to work the\nchinese built one that did not do it that way and what happens is they send these seeds out into space and remember what i said about\nthe pyramids built by the russians they tossed the seeds in and what\nhappened to the seeds 400% more productive seeds 400% bigger\nplants would\nyou like to see the kind of crops that the chinese were growing when\nthey just flew the seeds into space let us go for it bang there is\nyour pumpkin that is the only thing they have done is grow it\nhydroponically and regular hydroponic pumpkins do not do this this is\na space pumpkin that is the only thing they did is fly it into space in a low\nvoice] it is the mystery of the great pumpkin from space every\nhalloween he comes in a ufo now\nthis is not that amazing that is actually called a bitter\ngrow it is not a whale penis contrary to your belief it is actually a melon now you\nknow those little hot peppers right those little hot \"oh jesus or maybe you really like it maybe you are a sadist\nand oh this is wonderful okay let us look\nat some hot peppers that is a lot bigger than they are supposed to be that is amazing stuff so is this the source of all life is all life found in an energy wave well check this out this is dr james strick sparks\nof life major scientific\nconspiracy 19th century many of these guys were arguing in favor of\ndarwin random mutation and others argued for spontaneous generation life from non-living things they did not know whether it was one or\nthe another they\nfound numerous experimental examples of \"spontaneous\ngeneration pasteur had cases where life originated from\nnon-living things so it is not as easily dismissed as we would like\nto believe louis pasteur is why you have \"pasteurized\"\nmilk all\nof these guys created a conspiracy where they buried data where you\nhave sterilized test tubes where nothing could grow in there and\ncritters grew in there anyway they threw it all away because they\nwanted to believe darwin was right because survival of the fittest\nis an illuminati philosophy that says if\ni am the best killer then i am the most evolved on the planet that is\nhow they felt about themselves so they enforced it into the\nscientific structure of the world history has been completely\nrewritten in favor of that model so\nnow this is a big mouthful and here's the guy's name which is also\na big mouthful professor pacheco you can find this on\nhttps www.orgone.org/articles/ax2001igna01a.htm it is\nvery simple what he did is he takes beach sand and he heats it up to\nwhite hot luminescence it is literally white hot and then he takes\nthat sterilized beach sand and he throws it into a sterilized test\ntube with sterilized distilled water in a vacuum so there is no way\nanything could have gotten in there five\ndays later this scum has grown on top of the test tube he scrapes\nit off and looks at it under a microscope would you like to see some\nof the little things that he saw in there let us go for it this is\nthe first one it looks like a little brain here's\nsomething that looks like it might be part of perhaps a sea\nvegetable like one of the leaves broke off when he put it under the\nmicroscope let us look up close on that little guy and tell me if you\nthink this is biological where\ndid his dna come from all that was was sand there was nothing else\nin there he sterilized the sand he sterilized the water sterilized\nthe air and yet this little critter grew in there and that is just\none part of a bigger plant there're pictures of where you see the\nplant here's\nanother one that looks like a red blood cell here's one that looks\nlike a white blood cell or a leukocyte but here comes  drum roll\nplease  the bomdiggity this little guy probably has 20,000 to 30,000 genes which is about\nthe same as you it is similar to little round worms and stuff this\nguy has a very complex dna structure because he has a defense\nsystem he has a head he has a mouth he probably excretes out here\nsomewhere which is too much information  but there he is where\ndoes dna come from dna is in space it is everywhere the dna wave\nsays oh this is the silica the\nbasis of sand i need to build little sea creatures in this stuff just\nlike when it is inside the nuclear reactor it says oh this is radioactive i need to build radioactive bacteria in\nhere life is being created\neverywhere it goes but\nit even goes beyond that now this really blew me away check this\nout national geographic february 15 2009 found identical species\nat the north and south poles but only at the poles that is the only\nplace you find them they\ntried to explain it as maybe there are ships that go from the south\npole to the north pole they analyzed every single ship in the world none of them do this at all so they found 235 different species that are identical at both poles they were startled they did not know what the heck was going on this\nincludes whales worms and crustaceans very weird crustaceans as\nyou are about to see exactly\nwhere these species came from and how they ended up a world apart\nwith comparatively warm oceans in between remains a mystery so they\ndo not know what the heck these guys are how they got there they\ndo not have any idea would\nyou like to see some of these creatures that emerged directly from\nthe consciousness field let us go for it they are very\nstrange-looking things this\nis called limacina helicina this is very strange it looks kind of like a snail but it is got\nthese fans on it like a squid it is a very weird-looking thing this\nis called clione limacina limacina another very strange-looking little creature this\none is gaetanus brevispinus this is a crustacean of some kind and\nlastly you have mimonectes\nsphaericus he is got a really\nnasty-looking defense system up front does not he he is a little\nbadass but he is out there doing his thing and guess what created\nhim the\nconsciousness of the earth spontaneously generates these little guys\nat both poles there is no conduit of sea water going from north to\nsouth pole he would have burned up on the way through the core think\nabout it the reason why he is there is because the field generates\nhim because he is supposed to be there because the earth makes him the earth has made us so\nthe solar system is creating evolution \u2013 dna evolves by outside\nenergy i am\ngoing to have to skip ahead through all this stuff so just give me a\nsecond here ah that is a good place to go because we are running out\nof time skips\nforward to slide that reads dr tszyan kanchzhen dna transformation\nby wave so\nwe have already seen now that you have dna that has been created out of\nthe ether same species at both poles you have seen the little guys\nthat grow in the test tube from nothing more than distilled water and\nsterilized sand there is this little scum that grows on top and you\nlook at it under a microscope and \u2013 boom here're these\nlittle critters what\nabout dna changing from one form to another what about transforming\ndna from one form to another so that you have the given genetic\nmaterial of one species and it transforms into something else well kanchzhen is the guy here and there is a lot of different ways to\npronounce his name most recently i have seen it spelled chiang c-h-i-a-n-g is his first name so there is many different spellings\nof this guy's name which makes it extremely difficult to find his\nwork online unfortunately so\nwhat he does in this anatomically-correct diagram is he is got your\nduck over here you can see the feathers the head quack quack quack there he is and over here you have a perfectly-described\nchicken  obviously i am being facetious what\nyou have here is these little funnels that have been built into the\nsides of a little pentagonal box he zaps this little duck with\nmicrowaves and all the microwaves go through these copper pipes from\none room to another if you talk in here you will hear it in here it is air that can pass through he is\nzapping it with microwaves which are not going to kill the duck it\njust kind of zaps his energy field enough to make it resonate make\nthe dna resonate and over here you have a chicken that has eggs in\nits womb slide picture of white duck]\n\n\nnow i want you to look at the physiology of a duck notice the long beak the webbed feet the longer neck the larger internal cavity of\norgans whereas a chicken by comparison this is not what they\nlooked like when they came out by the way that is just to fool you i\nactually found this when i was looking for the picture of the chicken\nwith the webbed feet and then i found her with ducks and i am like wow is not that a synchronicity so anyway look shorter beak no webbing between the toes this\nis what actually hatched these are called duck-hens you see webbing\nbetween the toes you see this strange-looking head we can get a\nbetter look at it here the eyes position is different you get the\nduck-shaped head the longer beak the webbing between the toes now here's the stats these add up to a total of 500 eggs 480 of them\nhatched 80% had a flat duck-shaped head like you just saw 90% had\nthe shift in the position of the eyes \u2013 90 and 25% had\nwebbing appear between the toes this\nis a chinese scientist who did this it is an amazing piece of\nresearch you go from this and you blend it with this and you get\nduck-hens that are half-and-half it is an amazing phenomena so if you have ever wondered what the heck is the duck-billed platypus maybe it just so happens that a bunch of ducks and a bunch of bulls\ngot together and did \"that which we cannot speak of in polite\ncompany and god got so angry he smote them with a lightning\nbolt then they had lots of little babies and the babies are like daddy mommy oh wow what the hell\nam i that could\nhave been what happened or maybe god just has a weird sense of\nhumor slide\nreads dr peter gariaev - astonishing dna wave transformation]\n\n\ngariaev\nis where we get to the final point that is going to help round out the\nwhole talk dna transformation you\nhave frog eggs okay the frog eggs are laid and they are all sitting\nthere then you have a salamander's eggs and you take a laser beam\nthat is not going to burn them it is not going to kill them it just\npicks up the wave information from the salamander you take those\nsalamander eggs you shine the wave through it you redirect the wave\ninto the frog eggs guess what happens to the frog's eggs you get a\ncomplete metamorphosis the genetic material of the frog's eggs\nbecomes cannibalized by the wave of the salamander cannibalized\"\nis maybe a strong word to use but it gobbles up all the genetic\nmaterial that was going to make a frog and totally rewrites the code\nand transforms it into a salamander's body it happens\nin one generation you have eggs that come out of a frog's body and\nthey turn into a completely different species that does not take very\nlong it is instantaneous energetic change so\nwhat we are seeing is this is the engine of evolution this is what\nthe solar system is doing to us the solar system's energy that is\ncausing all of the planets to charge up is the same as the energy of\nthe laser that goes through the salamander and shines into the frog transforms the frog eggs into salamander eggs and they become\nhealthy adult salamanders they can\nbreed with each other they do not get all these genetic problems when\nthey get older they do not have the complications associated with\ngenetic cloning of the genetic conundrum that you have with dolly\nthe sheep where like the feet go bad as she gets older so again i want to have you look once more at the fossil record this\n26-million-year cycle why do you think it is happening in such\nregular intervals of 26 million years this\nis raup and sepkoski why do you think they found another cycle\nthat is 62 million years long what do these zones actually represent well here's what we are going to talk about to cap off the whole talk for\nyou galactic bioenergy fields may be responsible we\nnow know thanks to dr william tifft that even though most\nscientists associate red shift which is just a microwave frequency \u2013\nthat is all it is is microwave light \u2013 they associate red shift\nwith distance tifft has looked  and his colleagues and people who have followed after him  have looked at hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds of galaxies and every single galaxy that they look at has a\nstructure like this okay what\nyou are seeing here is this is high intensity red shift or high\nintensity microwaves and then it goes lower and lower as you go out so these frequency changes are very regular this is within a regular\ngalaxy now what is happening is - you can see another example of it\nhere these are red shift structures you see the layers what is\nhappening we know from dr rosine lallement - and here's the link\ndown at the bottom you can verify this she\nthinks this is only a coincidence but what she sees is that the\nlocal interstellar medium the clouds that are around our solar\nsystem are moving directly away from the center of the galaxy they\nare expanding away from the center of the galaxy so what we are seeing now is that these guys these clouds in the galaxy\nare going to be expanding away from the center in regular intervals just like lallement discovered this appears to have the energy from\nthe galaxy that reprograms all dna and all life on earth now\ni ask you this if you have these 62-million-year cycles in the\nfossil record if you have 26-million-year cycles in the fossil\nrecord if you have these striated evenly-different frequencies of\nmicrowave energy in the galaxy if dr rosine lallement has proven\nthat the clouds are flowing at us directly from the center of the\ngalaxy  then do not you think maybe just maybe interplanetary\nclimate change is being caused by galactic energy fields which are\nsqueezing in the heliosphere making it 25% smaller shooting in\nparticles to the solar system causing all of the planets to get\ncharged up hotter brighter more magnetic and that that energy\nactually has the dna wave information to transform every living\nspecies on this planet into the next level because guess what this is a 62-million-year cycle and the last time it\nfired up was 65 million years ago this is probably off because of\nthe variations in the influx of solar radiation we are at the end of\nthe cycle right now now\nthere is one thing that we are going to end with and that is the final\nproof that is going to make this all come together for you slide\nreads human evolution is dramatically speeding up]\n\n\ni\ncan prove to you that human evolution is already doing what we expect\nit would do based on interplanetary climate change based on the\nscience i have showed you i have the scientific proof that you are\nactually evolving genetically based on this science check this\nout john\nhawks university of wisconsin anthropologist studied evolution in\nhuman beings \u2013 it is called positive selection he found\nthat in the last 5,000 years your dna is upgrading a hundred times\nfaster than ever in human history in fact the last 40,000 years\nhave been a time of supercharged evolutionary change we\nare more genetically different from people 5,000 years ago that is\n3,000 bc that is the time of things like the time of sumerians and\nthat is the time of the indian hindu scriptures we\nnormally think of these people the old testament and just a little\nbit after that ancient egypt people building pyramids we do not\nthink of them as much different than we are but\nif you compare those people that are building pyramids in egypt to\nthe neanderthals \u2013 neanderthals right with the big clunky\nbrow nothing like mine my brow has nothing like that i am not a\nneanderthal he\ncompared those people in egypt with neanderthals and they are more\nsimilar to neanderthals than they are to us you do not think about it\nbecause we look around we say yeah these are people everybody is the same you know but\nlook the genetic proof is already here we have changed more in 5,000\nyears than ever in human history and he is calling it supercharged this is an actual mainstream media proof of that and\nhere's another one showing that our evolutionary fast lane is\nbecoming increasingly different at a hundred times faster in the last\n5,000 years now here's the last thing our average iq has had to be increased by\nthree points a decade it is been studied in over 20 different\ncountries by flynn and it is continued for over a century and our\niq is rising the most in abstract nonverbal patterns which means it\ndoes not have to do with us reading more magazines newspapers and\nsurfing the internet it is a symbolic intelligence so\nthis is the hard-core proof scientifically measurable the reason\nwhy the iq is going up like that because a score of 100 is supposed\nto be average that is how it is weighed so in order to keep 100\naverage you have to bump it up by three points every 100 years \nbecause everybody's getting so much smarter you got to keep knocking\ndown their iq score because\neverybody's average is now 100 that means everybody is so much\nsmarter now your iq is going to go down and down and down which if\nyou have low self esteem could really hurt you so do not hang out\nmuch longer just you know psfaw no i am not saying you should\nkill yourself of course unless you are really really arrogant about\nyour iq anyway this is where we are going it amounts to a cultural renaissance so the galaxy \u2013 and this is the final point \u2013 20 years of\nstudy of esp has proven scientifically sound studies he looked at\nall of these studies  spottiswoode his name is  to see if people\nwere psychic when it is high noon or a certain time of the day he\ndid not find anything in the normal day which is where the sun is\nrelative to the center of the earth but when the earth's position\nrelative to the center of the galaxy was studied he found that when\nyou are aligned with the center of the galaxy your esp ability goes\nup by 400 this is a mainstream scientific study so\nthink about this we now have the proof and this is what i am going\nto end on we now have the proof that galactic energy as you see\nright here he took 20 years worth of studies into esp 20\nyears and he found that people got more psychic when the galactic\nenergy field is hitting them i have\nshowed you layers of fields in the galaxy that are measurable on a\nsuperficial level by microwaves just like near-infrared is showing\nup on the planet same thing i have\nshown you proof from rosine lallement that these galactic energy\nwaves are in fact expanding away from the center of the galaxy as\nthey go out it is not proof but it is certainly circumstantial\nevidence that strongly leads in that direction i am\nshowing you proof that the solar system is changing proof that the\nsun's heliosphere is shrinking which suggests very strongly a\ngalactic causation if\nthe galactic energy can make you more intelligent and if all the\nspecies on the earth are being reprogrammed in their dna in 62- and\n26-million-year cycles and if we are at the end of another\n62-million-year cycle right now then let us put our hands together because we are awake and aware and we are walking into the new age maybe in 2012 thank you\nso much applause ovation]\n\n\nall right i got a standing o baby a standing o bill ryan\nand kerry cassidy go onstage to thank and embrace david wilcock]\n\n\ni am glad\nyou liked it david thank you that was absolutely superb as usual i wish we\nhad more time for you actually david\nwilcock ladies and gentlemen and thank you very much for staying\nwith us all this time being so patient bill ryan (br so this is bill ryan here and kerry\ncassidy (kc kerry cassidy from project camelot and we are honored genuinely honored and\nprivileged to have been invited here to the exopolitics summit in\nbarcelona and the date today somebody is nick\npope (np twenty-third of july 2009 excellent this is the guy from the ministry of defence who always knows what day it is and what is going on thank you\nvery much nick what\nwe are doing here is we are gathering the opportunity to talk\nwith most of the speakers who are appearing here this weekend on\nspain\u2019s first exopolitics summit this is a formal/informal\ngathering a meeting of great minds considerable experience between\nus i think i will not add up the number of years  it might be\nembarrassing we are\njust going to talk about the general subject of disclosure and just\nsee once we kick that ball off where it might go in the next hour\nand a half kerry i\nwould like to say that we are going to do a transition about an hour\nand half into this onto live radio so i just want to say that\ncaveat\nright at the beginning on top of it we decided we would start out\nwith introductions so we are going to go around the table and\ndo some brief introductions of all the speakers here i want to start\noff with paola paola harris paola\nharris (ph my name\u2019s paola harris i am a little old\namerican journalist i have been working in this field for 30\nyears i\nbegan working with dr j allen hynek astronomer researcher professor at northwestern university because he was a consultant to\nsteven spielberg for close\nencounters of the third kind and so i saw the film and i went to see him and he was my teacher for\n6 years i knew this was real because i started with a scientist who\nwas working in this field i\njust want to say that i graduated \u2013 because i am a\nteacher i also have a masters in education \u2013 from ecology to\nwhat i call exopolitics and my definition of exopolitics\nis the formal academic\nstudy of the ufo phenomena and contact and its political and\nsociological implications for the planet so\nnow i am mainly in that field and i have written three books the\nlast one all of the above which talks about\npossible protocols of exopolitics protocols  things like we need\nto look at a universal and planetary involvement this is not an\namerican problem it is not a french problem it is not a\ngerman problem  it is a planetary problem so\nthat is where i am coming from that will be my focus that\nwill be my talk and that is what i am interested in paola thank you very much dr brian o\u2019leary dr brian o\u2019leary (b\u2019ol my name is brian o\u2019leary in\n1967 i was appointed to go to mars by nasa as an astronaut then when the u.s got involved in vietnam i became a free energy\nactivist and a peace activist the\ncontact experience and the whole ufo phenomenon to me ushers in\nmany more things that can help us with our own problems here on the\nplanet my\nprinciple activity over the last several years has been to visit the\nlaboratories of some of the best and brightest so-called zero-point\nand other breakthrough clean energy concepts my\nlatest book the energy\nsolution revolution talks about the politics and the social implications of a\nbreakthrough energy economy i think that the energy \u2013 and\nbecause of the suppression of free energy technologies which has\nbeen rampant and the high danger of doing this kind of work \u2013\nmakes it extremely symbiotic with the whole question of ufo/et\ndisclosure so\nto me exopolitics\nmeans going outside the box of normal inquiry and being able to\nembrace those technologies which can truly create a sustainable\nfuture for planet earth wonderful stephen\nbassett (sb you know brian they are sending people to mars now so you still have a shot and from what we understand all you do is walk into a sort of like elevator or \u2018jumproom to mars and so there is\nno flight actually involved b well that sure beats chemical rockets you bet so that is another story and now do you know what i had love to call you dr bob dean i think we\nshould start calling you dr bob dean bob\ndean (bd call me anything you like as long as i am not late\nfor dinner but did not you say sergeant\nmajor command sergeant major command sergeant major okay bob who are you tell the world this is your chance i have to stand up i do not talk well sitting down very good i first became aware of the extraterrestrial presence 45 years ago but i did not come out and start speaking about it until 1991 i\ntook an oath when i was in the military i had cosmic top secret\nclearance while i was at shape [supreme headquarters of allied forces\nin europe] headquarters in paris and i took an oath not to divulge\nany of the classified material that i had learned while i was in the\nservice and while i was in paris i\nkept myself to that oath until 1991 a couple of events occurred in\n1991 that outraged me to such a point that i could not keep quiet any\nlonger a\ngood friend of mine an air force fighter pilot had just gotten back\nfrom a full tour in japan he was flying his jet over florida and he\nhad an incident\nin the sky at 40,000 feet where he looked out of his canopy to the\nleft and he happened to see a circular disk with a dome and he found\nhimself looking into the face of another human being looking at him when\nhe got back on the ground he had to talk to somebody about it and\nexplain what happened well speaking openly about it was his\nmistake the\nair force grabbed him sent him to newfoundland to a united states\nair force base in newfoundland without his family now back in\nthose days they did things like that i have been told that they\ndo not do those things anymore but i do not believe it another\nthing that brought me out\nof the closet as it were\n\u2013 a figure of speech \u2013 i was denied a promotion for a\njob i was working in pima\ncounty as an emergency\nservices special operations field operations my boss retired i\napplied for his job i went through the entire hiring process and i\nwas turned down for the job i\nconfronted the sheriff who happened to have the hiring authority at\nthe time and i was told that well you are one of those people who speaks out a little bit openly\nabout ufos i cannot have you working in here in the department\nof emergency services and\nif you will forgive my french i got myself the meanest lawyer in\ntown and i sued the son of a bitch i went through two years of\nlitigation spent $20,000 of money that i did not have and after\ntwo years of litigation i won the lawsuit i got the job i got the\nback pay and i got $100,000 of tort damages but\ni was so outraged at these two incidents \u2013 that i had been\ndenied a job promotion and my good friend had been sent to\nnewfoundland without his family  i reached such a level of outrage frustration anger aggravation that i began to violate my national\nsecurity oath and speak openly about what i had learned what i had\nbeen shown what i had been told because i had had top secret\nclearances all my career anger is a great motivator you see i am not an easy person to get along with sometimes by the very nature of the fact that i retired as a command sergeant\nmajor we had a reputation all of whom retired command sergeant\nmajors have a reputation of being able to\nchew ass and take names as they used to say kerry\nlaughs] so i have no patience\nand i have no toleration for lies bob thank you so much for that so i came out of the closet in \u201991 i have been speaking\nopenly and bluntly about this subject and i want to say to you all\nwho are here that this is the greatest most important subject in the\nhistory of the human race because essentially it is\nthe story of\nthe human race ladies\nand gentlemen good friends all of you  we\nare not alone and we have never been alone we have had an intimate interrelationship with advanced\nextraterrestrial intelligence from the beginning of our history and\nthat interrelationship is still going on i am\nvery gratified to be a part of this conference here in barcelona and\ni want to make it very clear to anyone who is interested is that\ni take my hat off to the sponsors of this program for having the\ncourage to do what they are doing here this\nis important so pay attention and listen  because you are not\nseen nothin yet thank you bravo voi\n wow okay stephen bassett following that steve are you an angry man stephen\nbassett (sb mm not at the moment first\nand foremost i think it is important that i say that i speak\nfor all of us when i say that we have nothing against the perfectly\nfine canadian province of newfoundland and i look forward to going\nthere someday and talking about exopolitics so for you\nnewfoundlanders out there  it is okay no problem i am\nstephen bassett i founded the paradigm research group in 1996 for\none reason only \u2013 to pursue the political resolution of the ufo\nissue that is it and that is all that i have done for\nthe last 13 years the\nscience and the ufology and the study of the sightings and all that\nhad gone about as far as it could in my view by then and it was\nclear that the government had a policy of withholding the truth and\nacknowledgement so that had to be addressed in\nthe early days back then 96 97 we were looking for\nnew terms a new lexicon and we talked about the\npolitics of ufos which\nis kind of a bridge term and then we talked about the concept of\ndisclosure that word turned up but\nin 2000 the word exopolitics\nturned up and that was due to the gentleman sitting to my left alfred webre and very quickly he was joined by others in\nparticular dr michael salla but\nthe moment i heard exopolitics that term the moment i heard it instantly i knew that that was\nthe umbrella under which we were going to proceed that was the boat\nthat we would sail in and so within a few days i think within a week i contacted art bell and there was something else going on at the time involving danny\nsheehan an activist attorney and i said we\nneed to get alfred and danny sheehan on the show at the same time because i was doing that for them back then helping them put\ntogether some shows so\ndanny sheehan and alfred webre came on danny was talking about some\nevents that occurred in the carter administration and alfred was\ntalking about that as well they both had a connection with the\ncarter administration and that was the reason but of course alfred\nwas talking about exopolitics and\nso from that day forward \u2013 2000 \u2013 we had that new term in only nine years it has now become on the edge of being a very\nsignificant change in thinking in terminology a new field of study when\nyou google it you can get i think now something like 180,000\nreturns off of exopolitics there\u2019re no extra pages it is all about the ufo/et issue it has no other use in the english language six hundred thousand i\nthink on yahoo it is on the verge of being in the dictionary so\nthat is in nine years a new field has developed and you need\nthat you need language in order to move forward you need new\nlanguage to go into new places so\nthis conference is part of that i am glad to be a part of it\nand i look forward to presenting on sunday very good bill may i interject something make your needs known and there\nwill be somebody who is listening kerry bill laugh background chatter]\n\n\n\n\n i need a milkshake but i do not think i am going to get\nit to your health  to all of you to your health very good who\nare you oh well no no no actually i would like to continue around the\ncircle here you do not want to say anything about camelot well i think in the end we can well okay okay all right i think the next person that we need to introduce is dr michael salla dr michael salla (ms in 2001 i was a professor at a university in\nwashington d.c american university \u2013 and i was\nteaching international politics i had graduate-level classes i\nsaw the video of the disclosure conference the disclosure project\npress conference and that really startled me i just had no idea\nthat this kind of information was out there prior to that i always\nthought that extraterrestrial life was real but you know some day\nin the future they will contact us and wow the world will\nchange so when i saw that press conference my world kind of really crumbled in\nterms of how i understood international politics and what was\nhappening in the world and\nso one of the first things i did was i showed the press conference\nvideo to a class the class was on theories\nof conflict violence and war\nand i showed it to the class 25 graduate students very progressive\nliberal arts students at american university i showed them the press\nconference and then i said you know what do you think and\ni asked the students well line up in terms of line up there is going to be a line on\nthe extreme right if you agree strongly that this video is real that you agree with that very strongly then get on the right if you\ndisagree strongly then get on the left if you are kind of\nneutral get in the middle so\ni asked them to separate themselves where they fit in on that line and of the 25 students two agreed one strongly and one moderately\nagreed that the video was real that the testimonies were valid the\nother 23 were either strongly opposed or kind of neutral about it that\nshocked me because basically what i was seeing was that university\nstudents were not ready to accept this information as real they\njust came up with many of the standard responses well they are making it up how do we know it is real cnn\nwould tell us if it were real so\nthat was kind of an important eye-opener for me i\nfound that the university administration was similarly not very\nimpressed with this topic so that led to my forced removal from the\nuniversity and i have been studying exopolitics ever since which\nfor me really involves looking at three different processes or\nthree different things it is\nlooking at what are the main actors or the individuals involved\nwith the question of extraterrestrial life so we looked at say the\nrole of the presidents \u2013 truman eisenhower kennedy and so\nforth \u2013 how they dealt with this issue of extraterrestrial\nlife the\nsecond is we look at the institutions what are the main institutions\nthat are being involved with this issue so straight away we come\nup with say the different intelligence departments especially the\ncia counter-intelligence the national reconnaissance office \nthe nsa so those are some of the institutions then\ni looked at what are the processes involved here some of the\nprocesses are like maintaining secrecy maintaining a psychological\nwarfare program to discredit debunk this whole question in the\ngeneral public arena and also funding these projects which are\noccurring behind the scenes so\nthose are the questions and the issues that i am very interested\nin i have been doing this now for eight years and i am\nstill learning and still finding things to be amazed at so this is\ntruly an amazing field the\nmore years you put into it the more things that you have more\nquestions about i have not yet reached that point where i feel\nthat i have understood the big picture that is right the more you find out the less you know thank you alfred alfred\nwebre (aw thank you very much as i was saying i am a\nfuturist an activist and a lawyer are you doctor\nalfred webre you know i always think that the lawyers tried to get a phony phd because i\ngot an llb and the legal association then changed all law degrees to\njd so technically are we lawyers  doctors doctor what do you\nthink you are a juris\ndoctor which sounds even\nbetter yeah i am a juris\ndoctor but i think that\nit is kind of back door that is kind of how i\nam i always question things and well i\nthink that steve has really given sort of a contextual background to\nwhat has happened over the first ten years of exopolitics what\ni have come here to this summit to really talk about is the next\nten or eleven years and that is in terms of what the larger\nastronomical and cosmic cycles that will be occurring \u2013 in an\namazing synchrony \u2013 that will serve as motors or propellants of\nthe process of disclosure and more deeply the process of a\ntransformation of our reality and the reality of all living things i\nthink which includes animals plants and minerals according to some of you i\njust want to bring all that kind of cosmic consciousness here because i think that that is really what disclosure is about and\nwhat will fuel disclosure will be an interactive elevation of the\nconsciousness of and\ni see a gentleman back there who will remain nameless who is\nsaying yes so just very briefly we are talking about the solar cycle-24 from\n2009 to 2020 with solar maximum at 2012 to 2013 and by the index\nof human excitability\nthat goes back to 500 bc we know that all revolutions wars riots and the fundamental fixing of things in society happens during the\nsolar maximum which nasa tells us now is in may of 2013 so in that general term we are in for some really dynamite stuff if we want to be changing agents in a positive way now\u2019s the\ntime to put out our agenda as dr bob dean says another\ncycle is the cycle of the matrix\nof time acceleration which dr carl johan calleman\nand barbara hand clow a colleague of mine who lives in vancouver canada also talk about that is where time is accelerating the\nrate of change is accelerating the rate of our consciousness is\naccelerating and\nthere will be probably according to this theory 20 times as much\nchange in the year 2011 as there was between 1999 when the internet\nstarted and the beginning of 2011 so that is the backdrop for\nhow disclosure can take place and finally there are the larger galactic and cosmic cycles sort of the\nsource of our thoughts of our reality of our dna as well of the\nstars the black hole at the center of our galaxy \u2013 most\ngalaxies have black holes \u2013 and how it\nwill be programming the other 97 percent of our junk\ndna in the coming years so that we can become more capable of interacting and therefore things will be disclosed so\ni look forward to this\nprocess and the process of the weekend very good thank you alfred i just want to say here that this idea of an\nindex of human\nexcitability \u2013 i\njust think that is such a wonderful name i just love it  i\ntake it very seriously but for me it is like how\nappropriate is that how excitable are we all now you\nknow and where is it\ngoing to go okay well calm right down oh i am getting too excited you are getting too excited and let us introduce nick nick\npope (np okay i am just plain nick pope  no doctor nothing like that my background is government british government i\nworked for the ministry of defence for 21 years i did about seven or\neight different jobs in that period and the one which has lead to me\nsitting at this table is a job that i did from 1991 through to 1994 when i was responsible for researching and investigating the ufo\nphenomenon for the british government the\nbrief was to look at the two or three hundred ufo sightings we had\neach year to see whether they were already defense-significant which rather cleverly in government terms is something that we\ndid not actually ever define perhaps that is a point for\nlater anyway my views on this were that most of these things of course turned\nout to be misidentifications there were plenty of cases where these\nthings were seen by pilots and police officers where they were\ntracked on radar performing speeds and maneuvers which seemed to go\nsignificantly ahead of anything in our own inventory including\nprototype aircraft and drones so\nmy position on the ufo phenomenon is that i think whatever it is \u2013\nand i am not one of these people that have a neat answer  i am\nsure perhaps there are not any neat answers in this business i think there are probably lots of different things going on lots of\noverlap but\nmy position is whatever the nature of this phenomenon or phenomena i believe it raises some interesting and important defense national\nsecurity and their safety issues other issues too which others\nbetter qualified than me here are going to discuss on the societal\nimplications the sociological implications that is probably\nless my field what\ni am here to really talk about at this conference is something\nwhich has been going for about a year and a half now \u2013 the\nbritish government\u2019s ongoing program to declassify and release to the national archives the entire archive of british ufo files\ngoing back to the \u201950s and coming into the present day so it is\ninteresting times in the uk and it is been a story all around\nthe world i\nleft the ministry of defence in 2006 i now work as a freelance\njournalist a media commentator not just on the unexplained but on\nconspiracy theories some political and some defense issues that is\nme very good i like it may i ask a question please sure the material that has been released so far \u2013 and i assume\nyou have checked it looked at it read it \u2013 is there\nanything in there of any real substance kerry\nlaughs]\n\n\n\n yes there is i think what there is not let me answer\nthat in reverse there is not\n\u2013 and i do not mean this in a disparaging way but it is\na neat sound bite that i have used before \u2013 there is not a\nspaceship-in-a-hanger\nsmoking gun that\nsaid there are plenty of those sorts of cases that i was mentioning\nwhere things have been tracked on radar performing some quite\nremarkable speeds plenty of police cases plenty of military cases the\none that really stood out and i discussed it on fox\nnews amongst others was\nthe case of milton torres the fighter pilot who in 1957 whilst a\nunited states air force pilot posted over to the uk was ordered to\nshoot down a ufo over the mainland uk so that is a case that\ni am going to be discussing in some detail at this conference i want to add that i interviewed as a journalist milton torres this goes to show that yes he was ordered to shoot down a ufo in\n1957 so there are\nshoot-down orders but\nwhat i saw on a human level and this is part of exopolitics also is\nthat he was very emotional about telling the story he told it at the\nx-conference with nick at stephen bassett\u2019s x-conference in\napril but\nas a journalist when i interviewed him he was very emotional because his father had died two years ago and he had kept this\nsecret for so long he began to cry and was very emotional about it these\npeople keep these secrets so long until the ministry of defence\nreleased these files it is a huge burden and there are so many\nof them i think more countries should release their files and it is happening absolutely it is happening well disclosure that is what it is all about did the ministry of defence ever ever take a position on peter\nhorsley\u2019s memoir where he said that he spent an afternoon\nhaving tea with an extraterrestrial and peter horsley was a retired\nair marshall indeed the ministry of defence as far as i can tell made some\nefforts to shall we say brief against him in other words a quote\nended up in the media which was \u2013 and i am doing this from\nmemory  but it was something like how\nunfortunate that a man when he was posted to strike command at that\nlevel and had his finger on the nuclear button has been seeing\naliens so behind the\nscenes they were disparaging him is not that sad it is\nsad and it is disrespectful it is\ndisrespectful of course i mean the other important thing is of course that\nperson as is often the case \u2013 well always the case in this\nsituation \u2013 did not give their name they were just listed\nas a defense source uh-huh a senior defense source\ntold us peter horsley was one of your top people he was an air marshall i\nwould have thought they would have paid attention and given some\nrespect to his opinion no they just they deployed the usual line which is let us\nput in a slightly disparaging comment but see if we can get the\nphrase \u201clittle green men somewhere in there and let us\nhope everyone just moves on thank you i am glad they got that on film okay thank you bob rob robert\nfleischer (rf yes you are waiting very patiently say your whole name and your background all right my name\u2019s robert fleischer i am the founder\nand coordinator of exopolitics germany and it is a great\nprivilege to be sitting here at this table with these brilliant\nminds i have\nstudied a lot and read a lot of things you have said and i have\nto say i am just so curious how this is all going to unfold i am going to make it short as i do not even have the\nsmallest part of the background that you all have i\ncame in touch with this field when i was 16 years old when i first\nmet the author erich von d\u00e4niken who wrote chariots\nof the gods in 1968 or\nsomething and became friends and whatever he was in my region and\nwe met and we had discussions and conversations we\nspent hours sitting on the lawn talking about god and the world and\nthe extraterrestrials it was so exciting for me at the age of 16 so you know it kind of made me curious about what else was there and\nwould not it be important for us all to know about it and why\nis not that on the media so\ni started a journalist career at a very early age i started working\nfor a local newspaper then i was a presenter on a local television\nshow so i kept working in this field and did my university degree at\nthe same time then like five years ago i think i stopped working for television because i finally understood that the reason why these important\nthings which we are discussing here \u2013 which is the alien\npresence and free energy and consciousness why\nthat is not in the mass media is not because people there  they\nnever think about doing that on the media \u2013 no it is just\nbecause they do not have the chance to do that because\ntelevision is simply not the right medium to do that people do not\nwant that on television because television has a certain control in\nour society a certain control function so i stopped working for television when i came across a kind of free\nenergy device made a tv report about it and they would not let\nme report on it they never actually broadcast that then\na couple of years later i also came across the disclosure project\npress conference on the internet and that kind of triggered my\ncuriosity again in this field because i thought how\nthe it is\nimpossible that in the mass media you always hear about weather\nballoons or whatever and then there is these highly-credible\nmilitary witnesses and insiders  all of you just sitting here at\nthis table  how is it possible that i have never heard about\nthat so\ni thought about what could\ni do so i founded\nexopolitics germany which is as stephen said an umbrella for all\nkinds of activities in this field which are necessary to bring this\nissue forward it is such a huge field it is physical\nevidence cover-up  disclosure but what i am interested in  and that is my personal interest\nin this  is the fact that these craft appear and disappear shows\nthat our reality is obviously much greater than what we ever thought\nit is it is not just three dimensions plus linear time no it is much more than that and i wanted to find out what\nis it and if these extraterrestrial visitors master these dimensions  these\nsuperior dimensions or supplementary dimensions or however you want\nto call them  what does that mean for their states of\nconsciousness how are they thinking what kind of consciousness\nlevel must they have to be able to adopt to \u2013 to master \u2013\nthese dimensions and what will it mean for us to understand how they\nthink or to put it in another way what would be the next level of evolution\nin human consciousness because we might assume that we would also\ncome across these other dimensions sooner or later so that is what\ni am actually interested in most but\nwhat really interests me the most is the consciousness thing and i am\nstrongly convinced that everything is actually in the end a\nquestion of consciousness yes please b yeah i was just going to say that yes the more recent experiments\nthat are being done among humans is the incredible power of positive\nintention that people\ncoming together in groups with an intention can actually create that\nreality it is\ninteresting that you have these two parallel tracks going on one is\nscience very good science being done here on the earth by\nuniversity scientists and at the same time you have the\net-ufo-disclosure issue and the two are very intertwined because\nthe et/ufo phenomenon just points so clearly towards this we\nneed to know this and we need all the help we can get from our\noff-plant/on-planet people that are going against the grain of black\nops and going against the grain of these horrible agendas that we\ncan actually heal the planet we can have a sustainable future so from my own point of view i am just very grateful to be here\namong you and to be able to interact in this way that is wonderful brian thank you so much let me have a go\nhere then i will let you have the last word absolutely for me having this kind of conference sometimes feels like a group\nof fishermen on a little island in the pacific ocean who are sitting\naround a campfire trying to figure out whether there is anyone\nelse in the world and what are these funny shiny things that they\nsee up in the air do you believe that i saw this thing up in the\nsky it is like what\nis that thing is that real or what our\nlevel of sophistication in asking these questions may not come close\nto the level of sophistication that is needed in order to get\nthe answers this is a bridge over i think into the world of\nexopolitics because while those islanders around this campfire in the south pacific might\nbe arguing with each other about whether they are all alone in\nthe world and what are these metal things that some people say that\nthey see in the sky what we are really interested in is \u2013\nassuming that there are\nother people in the world and assuming that they do\nfly around in these metal things in the sky \u2013 what are their\nagendas what\nare they\ndoing with the world what are they doing with our\nworld what is it that they\nmight be doing that we might need to know about on our little island what might be their agendas for us what is it all about and who are we and how did we get here in\nthe first place and\nif we look at the political implications of that the questions are\nso\nenormous and so\nfar beyond the questions that one might get in \u2013 i do not\nknow \u2013 in a media article about is\nit possible that aliens could really exist it is\nlike come on this is a given but who are they where are they\nfrom when\nare they from what are they doing what is our place in the\nuniverse and what do we need to know in order to understand these\nthings what\ndo our own governors and politicians and military intelligence\nspecialists know that we are not being told and why\nare we not being told i\nbelieve that the exopolitics movement is trying to speak to those\nissues and this is one of the directions in which i think that this\nwhole conversation would like to go before\ni introduce my colleague kerry cassidy i want to say that several\npeople here have talked about steven greer\u2019s disclosure project\npress conference and i remember exactly where i was when that\nhappened i\nwas driving down a scottish road at about two of the clock in the\nmorning and this was coming over on live bbc radio i was so\nastonished that i stopped my car to listen to it because i did not\nknow whether this was a joke then i realized this was real this was\nbeing streamed live and i thought this\nis amazing this is now going to turn the world on its head this is\nextraordinary what steven greer is doing i\nwish he was here right now because i want to acknowledge him for\nthat that was an incredible thing then\nmany of us waited for what was next what was going to happen after\nthis where was the disclosure project going to go next after this\nincredible public relations feat which they created one\nof the things that happened while we were waiting is that kerry\ncassidy picked up a consumer-grade camcorder that is about as big as\nthis wine glass from what i can remember and started going to ufo\nconferences to talk to them because somebody had to do that job it\ndoes not matter whether you have got money it does not\nmatter whether you have got high technology what you need is the\nintention\nto start talking to people because this is a process that is ultimately all about communication and that is all to\nkerry] and you are a\nmaster communicator so i now want to introduce you with that tell\nus about project camelot well okay thank you bill that was a lovely introduction obviously we are project camelot we have been asked to come and host\nthis panel discussion we are actually going to sit back and\njust moderate in many ways we are not going to be speaking but\njust to introduce us as the moderators we formed project camelot\nbecause we met at laughlin and actually bill was one of the people\ni interviewed he was one of my first interviewees if you will when\ni interviewed him on the subject of serpo i was very impressed by\nhis balance by his command of the language by his sort of good will\ntowards what i knew were probing questions that i have sort of a that is a euphemism sort of a talent with handling he really rolled with it very\nnicely he handled it well and yet he was very very\nstraightforward he\nwas not taking sides other than to say that the serpo story was\nsomething that he felt was important enough  it needed to be\ndiscussed it needed to be understood and it needed to be talked\nabout it needed to be explored and investigated and he was there to\nencourage that process i\nthink that in many ways what happened when we formed project\ncamelot is that we really wanted to extend what was the initial\nimpulse of what  i guess you could call the disclosure project\ninitially  which was to go out to put a camera in front of\nsomebody\u2019s face to ask them questions to let the audience\ndecide and that is really been our mission from that day\nforward we\ndecided this in tintagel we really connected there we connected\nwith the past of king arthur and the roundtable and the idea of not\na hierarchy but a sort of a utopia in which all people were equal\nand all opinions would be listened to that is\nreally what we wanted to do with project camelot we wanted to allow\nthe camera and the power of the internet to connect these people it is\nbeen an incredible journey we have gone all over the world we have interviewed some of the most charming brilliant minds i\nhave to say that are here on planet earth at this time we have\nbeen fortunate in that way some\nof those people are sitting around the table today with us some are\nin the audience so\nit is been very exciting it is been a lot of work hard\nwork we have gotten tons of support from the audiences around\nthe world we want to thank all of them at the moment for that this is a bridge into our most recent whistleblower interview it\nhas not been published we are still waiting for the okay to do\nthat this is with dr pete peterson we\ninterviewed him it is nearly four weeks ago now and he was a man\nwho had some extraordinary things to say this is now our intro into\none of the main topics of this conference yeah absolutely what we are covering here is really\ndisclosure and i want to say that in many ways what it is\nreally all about is truth that is what we are interested in seeking with project\ncamelot but it is also what this conference is about we are\nreally trying to get to the bottom of what is truth what does it\nmean to be human what does it mean to be a member of a galactic\ncommunity that involves peoples and extraterrestrials interdimensionals all kinds of beings all kinds of places all\nkinds of levels  all kinds of dimensions and\nto take that holistic view and the fact that we are multidimensional\nbeings simultaneously here and many other places we are time\ntravelers all of us we are ets all of us and those are extensions\nof the concept so\nto get back to the discussion what did pete peterson say one of the things that our recent whistleblower was talking about\nwas the fact that there okay well you are supposed to talk\nabout this topic i am supposed to talk about this topic okay what\npete peterson told us on camera is that he had heard from somebody\nwho had already booked the time with the networks that there is to\nbe a planned disclosure towards the end of this year by president\nobama who will confirm the reality of contact with four or five or\nsix  we do not quite know the number  friendly et races that\nwas what he was prepared to say on record now this is the kind of\nthing that stephen bassett has been waiting for for the last 13\nyears or longer it seems like 30 years actually bill and what you have been saying on record that obama is going\nto be the disclosure\npresident now maybe none of us should hold our breaths because it is quite a\nlong way to hold our breath until the end of the year and peterson\nwas also anxious to say that just because it is planned it\ndoes not mean it is going to happen but we believe him\nwhen he tells us that at the moment this is being slated there\nare all kinds of reasons why this might be true because as stephen\nhas pointed out in his many many on-record comments about all of\nthis america is under quite some pressure to disclose because how\nembarrassing would it be for them if some other little tin-pot\ncountry like great britain comments laughter] or france laughter comments everyone talking at once]\n\n\n\n okay before we get into name-calling i think we should start off on the question of disclosure knowing what our recent whistleblower\nwas talking about could\nyou talk about how this affects your view \u2013 and we want to hear\nfrom everybody \u2013 on whether you think this is possibly going to\nhappen whether you think it is not going to happen and why and\nalso what are the implications if it does may i what are the implications for exopolitics if it does and how does\nexopolitics respond etcetera it is been my observation that when you get 25 people into a\nroom you have 25 separate visions of what disclosure really means mm-hmm and my point is this i think disclosure is underway and has been\nunderway for quite a while i\ndo not believe that you are going to have obama getting on\nnational television and saying gee\nwhiz guys we have got some news for you we are\nnot alone we have been visited by guys from other star systems\nand other planets whoopee and\neverybody gets excited you know they all run to the door to get it\non the evening news that is\nnot the way it is going to happen now that is my view and i will be the first to admit that it could happen that way although i doubt it kerry\nlaughs]\n\n\n\nbut\nyou know you cannot come out on tv and say oh lookee we have known this for years we have kept it from\nyou because we did not think you could deal with it but now\nwe are going to level with you and tell you the truth is not\nthat nice okay it is like opening pandora\u2019s\nbox this is where we start to get some really interesting reactions from\npeople already people are leaning forward in their seats because\nthey want to you are not going to get a disclosure like that recognize that\nit is\nunderway it is taking place it is been underway for some\ntime and it is the form of subliminal\neducation when\ni made a presentation some time back at laughlin nevada i spoke\nabout the three stevens\nand the apocalypse and\nthis one indicating\nstephen bassett]\n\n\n\n i was the apocalypse this was one of the three\nstevens that i spoke\nabout \u2013 steven greer stephen bassett and steven spielberg mm-hm and i also gave the definition of the greek word apocalypse which is not at all what most fundamentalists think it is that of\nthe four horsemen riding what is it armageddon war famine plague pestilence and all that the greek word simply\nmeans the disclosure the\nunveiling and the revealing really that is been underway now for over 20 years and steven\nspielberg has played a major role in that absolutely with his movies and that tv special he did was dynamite really was it taken kc taken yeah taken that was so filled with real truth yes yeah absolutely that i would like for them to run it again and maybe they\nwill but you are in the midst of disclosure my friends and\nit is happening right around you every day i want to ask michael salla wants to jump in i do not think anyone would disagree with that michael wants to jump i think we had all agree we\nare part of disclosure michael wants to jump in but stephen was supposed to have a chance no no no michael can jump in any time he wants i always defer to\nmichael  that way i keep getting asked back to hawaii after his\nconferences i am deferring to michael i have an idea as to what might be released at the end of this year one of the things to keep in mind is what\ndoes the government know about this one\nof the things that i think is very important is that in 1969 there\nwas  memorandum released by a brigadier general called the\nbolender memo and that basically said that ufo reports are separated\nin terms of their national security implications those that were not\nvery significant went into the blue\nbook system and we know\nthat blue book ended in 1969 those\nthat had significance in terms of national security went into the\ncirvis\nsystem which is the\ncommunications instructions for reporting vital intelligence\nsightings and that went\ninto a separate body for study and analysis because it had national\nsecurity implications so\nyou have two bodies of information concerning ufos \u2013 those that\nare kind of like just the sightings that are recorded by radar that\nbecame part of the blue book system and were eventually released in\n\u201969 or up to \u201969 and those that concerned more\nsignificant events such as crashes of ufo disks that went into the\ncirvis system so eventually where did all of these reports end up i\nbelieve that the cirvis reports went into the archives held by\nvarious corporations that have been studying these files for reverse\nengineering applications for then contracting out to the military\nservices that might want to use some of this technology and the\nother stuff that did not have national security implications\njust became available through the ngo [non-governmental\norganizations so\nwhat is going to be released at the end of this year i think the key\nis that what you mention by dr pete peterson was you said\nup to six races well i have a kind of memory about who is talked about up\nto six races in 1977 there was a congressional research study done that was exploring the\nquestion of ufos what is\nout there it\nwas president carter who asked for this to be conducted because he\nasked the cia to be briefed on ufos and he was told no\n\u2013 bush said no to him so he could not get his hands into\nwhat was actually in the archives he could not find out but he\nasked the congressional research study to go out and do a study on\nthis this\nwas done by marcia smith who was a senior congressional science\ninvestigator she went out and she came up with a report that between\ntwo to six extraterrestrial civilizations have been visiting the\nearth that\nreport was not compartmentalized that was something that danny\nsheehan says he has a copy of that he never released it but he has\na copy of that so\ni think if peterson is correct that towards the end of this year we are going to have a disclosure i think what that could be\nwould be something like obama ordering the congressional research\nservice to make this document publicly available so you will\nhave a congressional research study becoming available saying that up\nto six extraterrestrial races are visiting us is it possible that the ets could force our hands by making\nappearances that would require that there be a governmental response it is possible but it would not be a good thing it would not be a good thing no why is that there\u2019re basically two kinds by the way there\u2019re a\nnumber of things i had like to comment on at some point yeah well no yeah i think he there\u2019re two basic kinds of disclosure okay one is\nself-disclosure that is when the nations of the world go to their people \u2013\nright the ones that they have this social contract with to\ngovern and say look this is what we know we have got these beings here we know this\nabout them do not be alarmed be alarmed whatever and we are\ngoing to try to inform you about this and\nthen over a period of time weeks months years the public will i am sure be quite interested in learning everything they can that honors the social contract that is the way governments are\nsupposed to operate that will instill a certain at least assure\nthat the contract is honored that is one kind the\nother kind is force\nmajeure disclosure that is where the governments keep going i\ndo not know anything nothing here nothing going on nothing to\nsee no problem \u2013and all of a sudden big ships start appearing over the cities of the\nworld well yeah now the government has to come forward and say well\nguess what yeah they are here and we did not tell you everybody of course is scared to death so in that version the social contracts of all the first world nations\n\u2013 third world nations have other things to worry about \u2013\nis broken you did not\ntell us you lied here they are what are we going to do and\nso that is a much more traumatic much more disruptive process that\nwill lead to a lot more problems and it is non-trivial the\ndifference is quite profound now the ets can do it anytime they want but i cannot worry about\nthat they are going to do what they are going to do they\ndo not tell me what they are up to all i can do is try to\nhelp us get this self-disclosure process out of the way i had like to ask a question if i may and i want to ask it of\nalfred do you believe that this extraterrestrial presence should be\na national security issue well i believe yes and no the yes part is as researchers we have\ncome across the fact that de\nfacto it is the\nextraterrestrial presence is has been handled since at least\nthe \u201950s on a national security level for\nexample i worked with a researcher andrew basiago who in the company of\nhis father who was a cia official in 1981 at an air force base \u2013\nat\nwright air force\nbase in new jersey\n[ed\nnote:googling \u201cwright afb brings up wright-patterson afb\nin ohio googling new jersey afbs brings up mcguire afb in\nwrightstown nj] \u2013 had a meeting\nwith three martian astronauts from the intelligent civilization that\nlives under the surface of mars now they were there on a visit on a coordinating visit with the central\nintelligence agency which means that if this version is true since\nat least 1971 \u2013 just that data-point alone \u2013 the us\ncentral intelligence agency and perhaps other intelligence agencies have some sort of a strategic alliance within our solar system now that may be a legitimate matter of national security but now we have\na whistleblower coming forth who is alleging this and who has a lot\nof data to back it up so that may be a disclosure the issue of the\nu.s presence on mars c\ni mean mr basiago in 1981 went to mars via teleportation from a cia\nteleportation launch room in el segundo california in the company\nof then-cia agent courtney\nhunt these are all\nactual names and\nvirginia\nolds a lifetime cia\nemployee called him in january of \u201909 to confirm that the cia\nknows that there is an intelligent civilization under the surface of\nmars she said a million i have no idea whether that is effective or\nnot so\nthe ship is leaking and whatever the matter of national security was\nin 1971 that caused these astronauts to come and have their liaison\nmeeting those matters should become public and if there is an obama announcement i mean i am just saying\nthis from the particular view that our organization is pressing obama\nto disclose the u.s presence on mars and to disclose the strategic\nalliance that it has with the intelligent civilization on mars now do you believe the american public just as an example and the\npublic in the world at large can deal with this information yes and you know we have objective data for that if we go to the\n2002 roper report which is available on the internet there was a\nspecific question that asked in that way and the answer came back\nthat 85 percent of the american public \u2013 and by extension i\nwould imagine most adult publics \u2013 are congruent in terms of\ntheir religion their personal values the\nquestion was if the\ngovernment announced that there was an extraterrestrial presence how\nwould this impact you and\nthe answer was 85 percent it is\ncongruent with my religion with my personal values and it would not\nruffle any of those very much so\nwe say the time is now the place is mars now will the u.s do it they may not because in certain ways according\nto certain military plans or intelligence plans it is possible\nthe u.s base on mars or bases on mars may be considered one of the\nmost strategic and important as a gateway to occupying the solar\nsystem via teleportation i had just like to say alfred for the benefit of the cameras\nhere and for anyone here who does not know this story that\nhenry deacon who is here at this conference who was here in this\nroom \u2013 i cannot see him right now  is he there no he stepped out he stepped out he is just coming in here he is okay well go ahead yes but we can talk about his testimony because we have already got\nit on the camelot site and he supports this fully as best as i am\naware the mars base has got a population a peak population of\n670,000 they travel there give or take give or take a few you know it depends on what you call human\nand what you do not they look like us pretty much people can\ncommute from this planet they are known as the anunnaki that is the name they go\nby some of them are some of them are the anunnaki of old the same\nones sitchin talked about who are now in a couple of factions but\nthere is a wide range of races basically who all look like humans just as we do and\nthe travel is through ah essentially it is\nteleportation and this is one of the biggest secrets they have\ngot this huge base there it is a multi-functional base okay but we are allowing the panel to talk here exactly but this is important information to put on camera yes it is and we just wanted to support you and we also want to support andrew\nbasiago who we also know we are saying the guy\u2019s not\ncrazy we have got somebody here in this room who can support\nthis story he does not want to go on camera but he can speak\nto the microphone if he wants to okay what about some of the other panelists here what is your\npoint of view of disclosure first of all what you are saying is probable alfred i will\nsay this now but i will also disagree as far as going to the public\nwith grade twelve when we have not done grade one two three four and five of disclosure yet because for me as a teacher and\nthis is teaching the public because they may be able to assimilate\nthis information but it is hard to digest it changed my whole\nentire life when\ni met hynek ed note dr josef allen hynek] it took a\nlong time for me to understand that contact was real i did not\nwant to believe that i was a nuts and bolts ufologist i wanted to\nlook at the craft the sightings i did not want to go to the contact\npart that was very hard for me because it changed reality so\ni disagree with saying that the general public could swallow this\nvery easily but\ni will support alfred in this way i did do an interview with pierre\ngiorgio agina who was marconi\u2019s partner and while i was doing\nthat he mentioned that marconi with the vatican had had martian\ncontact is 1939 and\ni knew this material i did not put it out there because the\nimplications of the vatican with marconi and extraterrestrials are\nvery heavy but i will talk about it today i am\nnot sure that the general public can go there if they have not\nunderstood the nature of roswell the nature of the cover-up the\nnature of visitation due to maybe our use of nuclear and the fact\nthat all aliens are not\ngrays these\nare things that we need to get straightened away because i can tell\nyou from having lived in europe where aliens look like us  the\npleiadians billy meier  and that there are people in the universe\nwho look like us and\nthen i go and move to america and on every single magnet t-shirt magazine and everything i see only the stamp of the gray being that\nis where they want us to remain in america because if you believe\nthat these extraterrestrials could be \u2013 and the martians are\nsome of them that look like us you know if you believe that  then\nit becomes very dangerous as\ncolonel corso said we\nwere not afraid of the extraterrestrial biological entities \u2013\nhe said at the pentagon \u2013 because\nthey were extraterrestrial biological entities we were\ndeathly afraid of their creators or what could be walking in the\nhalls of the pentagon so\nthis is very complex i am not sure the general pubic the whole\nworld and everybody needs to have the whole entire thing in one big\nswallow because it is very difficult to digest yeah thank you paola i want to bring in brian here because i\nhave a sneaking idea that i know what he is going to say but\ni will ask him this question which is have we got time to be\nprecious about this disclosure issue do we have time on planet\nearth do you believe b well we are obviously at a huge crossroads here and i am\naware of the psychological implications of the grieving process\nthat is going on right now that we are grieving an old\nparadigm and transforming to a new elizabeth kubler-ross in some of\nher work talks about the phases of grief we have\nbeen in a state of mass denial denial always being the first stage the second stage is usually anger i\nhad this bumper sticker for a while that said the\ntruth will set you free but first  it will piss you off and\ni think that we are poised on that people are getting very\nangry and outraged by these cover-ups so there has to be a process\nthat maybe we can help engineer \u2013 and i know steve you have\nbeen involved in this \u2013 of creating some sort of negotiating\nwhere the transition is not too painful for any particular\ngroup and\nthat we can get out of this swamp you referred to bill the swamp of\ndeceit and lies and spin we are i think in a situation now\nwhere maybe we can discuss with our adversaries obviously the darkest agendas we hear about  like eugenics and so\nforth  are horrible and we do not have to do that i had\nlike to be able to discuss that ultimately with the rest of the\nworld or even with those individuals who are in charge to be able\nto say well maybe we can\ndo something else maybe we can\nhave a world of free energy maybe we can support the current\npopulation maybe we can make the contact experience a positive thing\nfor all of us and\nthat is the direction i had like to see us go in rather than\ncoming out fear come out of a sense of diplomacy and understanding\nall around that is a great bridge into the potential role of exopolitics i wonder who wants to pick up that ball and run with it can i say something rob now you are all great researchers sitting on this table and it is\ndoubtlessly so interesting listening to all of the insider stories\nand all of the testimony but what you just said actually means that\nwe need to find a way to  and paola said that too  we need to\nfind a way to prepare the understanding of the whole thing we\nneed to make people aware that we are not looking at something like\nat a bottle like i am looking at the bottle and you know after five minutes i will have looked at it from any perspective\npossible and i will have understood it entirely no it is the\nopposite we\nare on this tiny little planet we are looking outwards that\nmeans that anything\u2019s\npossible in the universe so i think that is the paradigm thing\nthat we have to prepare but how do we do that i\nthink the strategy is probably not in telling everything we know and\ngiving out the information like that i think it is much more\nbasic than that it is like well yeah let us  evidence first of all and\nthen i think it is also about showing relationship between the\nufo cover-up and certain other things that are going on in the world i think that is also important when\nwe talk about the understanding of the greater reality that these\nvisitors live in it is also important to know that we\nwait for the paradigm shift but there are also people in quantum\nphysics who have been waiting for paradigm shifts for almost one\nhundred years now you know so maybe the third thing is cooperation with certain other groups anyway i think the nuts-and-bolts thing is the most important b and i just want to return for a moment to the question of how\nmuch time do we have i\nhappen to feel that the ecological condition of the earth \u2013\njust giving my research \u2013 is so grave that we are going to\nhave to create the foundation of cooperation in the very near future to be able to come up with new paradigms of disclosure that will\nallow us to develop the new paradigm to develop the energy sources\nwe need to tide us over to be able to directly confront alternative\nagendas and be open about it at least with those who are in control\nnow and in terms of the release of the information that it would be based\nmore on just reasonable \u2013 ah how should i say it a\nreasonable but chaotic transition period that is great well i sort of want to say that in answer to what bob dean is\ntalking about disclosure is happening it has been happening we are\npart of it \u2013 camelot paola one of the early pioneers in this\narea alfred webre exopolitics you know michael salla etc it is already been done you know if you will the work\nhas been done this\nis the funny thing about all this obama\u2019s announcement is\nactually coming at the end \u2013 i am just positing here for\nyour consideration from my point of view \u2013 the end of the\nprocess rather than the beginning it is\nalready out there spielberg did it for you we did it it is\nbeen done the fact is what we are really talking about is\nsomething coming at the tail end for the people who have not gotten\nclued in up to now now i am well aware it is the majority of the populations out\nthere quite possibly but i actually have a sort of optimistic view\nof the level of intelligence out there and the fact that we are all\nets anyway so\nyou have to keep in mind that we came here \u2013 these bodies are\ntemporary okay it is a much bigger reality and even the most\nsilly dumb person out there has consciousness of having been able to\ngo other places  in their dreams if nowhere else so\nthe consciousness is actually out there it is like it is\nready it is primed and it is been primed in part by the\ncontrollers if you will as well as us \u2013 okay who have picked up the ball and\nrun with it and we hopefully have run with it farther and faster\nthan they wanted us to maybe\nit sounds as if the ground perfect i mean is this perfect timing now well listen to what alfred webre\u2019s talking about and the sun\ncycle 24 and actually what we are moving into which is the\nperiod between now and 2017 the matrix of time acceleration how about that we are talking about a consciousness change that is making\nall of this possible and accelerating it all very quickly so that\nchange is not going to happen in the same way it is happened in\nthe past it cannot brian\no\u2019leary you are right so where do we go from here how\ndo we get it out there even further and\nif\nthe government the government is coming at the tail-end because\nthe government is not in control obama is not in control we all\nknow that he is the front guy okay they have\ngot technology according to our whistleblowers that is quite likely\n10,000 years in advance of anything we are dealing with right here\nand now in this reality we have been held back for a very long\ntime on this planet it is\ntime that we actually take this baton in our hands and say okay you want to run with this obama we are going to give you a run\nfor your money and actually that is what this\nis all about okay we are going to release this video it is\ngoing out there and we are going to say you\nknow what we already know we\ndo not need\nobama sitting on a pedestal to tell us that disclosure is now disclosure is it has been and we are clued in now if the rest of the people out there are not clued in we are\ngoing to continue to do our jobs we are going to wake up the\nplanet obama is just one individual and he is only representing\na very fake part of the government anyway so\nlet us say disclosure\nis us in a certain\nsense very briefly can i remind you of one scene in close\nencounters and this is\nvery brief all\nthe witnesses that had seen the lights came to a press conference something like this and they all said i\nsaw this light and\neverybody in the media believed them they were you know they were\ntalking about their experiences then out of the blue this man stands up in the back and says and\nyeah i saw bigfoot\nthe other day right back\n\u2013 i saw bigfoot \u2013\nand bigfoot exists so let us not even go there i\nclosed down the whole entire truth-saying because spielberg was\ntrying to say that people cannot digest too much too fast speaking of digestion do you believe \u2013 and i will throw\nthis out to the panel \u2013 do any of you believe that the american\npublic en masse can deal with the reality of having been lied\nto and cheated\nfor the last 65 years if they were to learn that we have a separate\nspace program did not you learn it did not you deal with it yeah and my whole damn paradigm collapsed around me that is\nwhy i am sitting here angry today you\nknow i have guns in my home  and i am almost to\nthe point of grabbing my american flag putting on my old uniform and going into the damn streets and causing a riot because of the\nfact that i have learned how many lies have been told for the last 65\nyears now take joe blow joe six-pack out there in kansas and he finds out\nthat he is been conned for so damn long it is true by a bunch of stinking politicians in washington and he is\ngoing to find out that he is got a separate space program that\nnasa is a joke and we are on mars and we can step through a portal\nin s4 and end up in pine gap these\nare realities and facts and it took me a hell of a long time to\ndigest this and not lose it you know because i am a typical\njoe blow i\nwas trained to be an infantryman i have been a grunt i have\nbeen in two wars i was this\nclose to going out there\nand beating the hell out of some of those government authorities do\nyou think that the average american is going to be able to handle it they just found out that the government has been lying to them and\nstealing their money right left and center they are still not\nin the streets they are suspicious and they have feelings that maybe they have\nbeen conned but the con is so big absolutely yes that when the average guy out there in the street in kansas city\nor sacramento or wherever when this really hits him the impact is\ngoing to be devastating there is a possibility here that they might ameliorate their\nown problem of disclosure by giving us some other problems as well\nto take our minds off this this is beyond the scope of this\nconference but if they crash the dollar no actually let us look at this why now think about this let us have some step up to the plate here michael what do\nyou think why now i think that a big factor that is driving this is that there is\na major dispute between the controllers on\nthe one hand you have got those that are tied up with the\ncorporations  majestic who have trans-nationalized this whole et\nphenomenon reverse-engineering going to corporations and enormous\nprofits beings made deals being made ets being involved in these\ndeals and on the other hand you have a kind of more constitutional group \nwhich is lead by the u.s navy  that has traditionally been more\ntidy with representing the national interests the\nnavy as i understand it is very upset with the way the whole\nmanagement system has been trans-nationalized has been taken out of\nthe hands of constitutional government in the u.s and that the navy\nis fighting back and\ni think it is very important to point out the role of the navy\nin the obama administration his director of national intelligence dennis blair is an ex-four-star admiral his national security\nadvisor jim jones is a four-star marine and the marines are\ntraditionally navy they are a kind of sub-service of the navy and\nnow you have had recently the appointment of a nasa administrator\nwho is an ex-marine a general again in the marines what\nyou have here is in the background a process by which these and\nall of these people that i have named have been briefed fully on\nthe ufo issue they know about the black projects and i think they\nare the ones that are preparing the groundwork for this to be moved\nforward i\nknow that the navy has been also involved in other things such as\nthe 2008 disclosure of secret meetings at the un concerning ufos and that a senior navy ufo working group was involved in that and i have recently been out to confirm that two of the\nvice-admirals three-star admirals that were involved in that were\n there was a blowback for that  and they were basically forced\ninto retirement and i cannot name them at this point but\nthere is been a struggle the navy took the initiative disclosing these un meetings there was blowback two three-star\nadmirals were sacked but that was kind of 16 months ago so there is\nbeen time for the navy to reorganize now\nyou have got these navy people surrounding obama so i think we\nare going to see this moving forward and the navy\u2019s going to be\nplaying a big role in that do all of you remember the movie called seven\ndays in may sure and you know what the gist of it was that a bunch of admirals and\ngenerals were going to take over the country mm-hm let me tell you something \u2013 and i have this from first-hand\nsources \u2013 there is a whole passel of generals and admirals that\nare so pissed off about this cover-up and the lies that are being\ntold that they are this\nclose to i\ndo not know whether they want to take over the country but i\nthink they damn well want the truth to come out yeah i think we can see some of the resignations that have been\nhappening as a result of that these guys are honorable men they give their lives to their country\nand they are not going to put up with this crap any more i mean we are talking about the united states and this is a\nworldwide situation what is interesting is that henry deacon is\nin the audience and he is nodding yes\nto what you have just said and\nin fact camelot is alive and operational \u2013 and we have been\ntold this by a number of people on the inside \u2013 because we are\nprotected by just such people which we call white\nhats it is just a\nterminology the reason i am alive is because of some of those people there you go ed\nnote normally the transcripts that had any parts in them that had\nbeen difficult for the transcribers to hear were put in \u201caudibles in square brackets in red for bill ryan to attend to fix then he had\npost the transcript however due to unexpected interruptions in the\nnormal working process in project camelot this normal process was\nnot able to proceed forward so the audibles were left in the square\nbrackets introduction all you need to do is just go out and do your job and have\nfun and watch your basketball and stay out of the way of the adults\nthat run the world i never bought that nothing in this\nworld \u2013 nothing \u2013 works the way you think it does there is always more to the story but the reason\nwhy i am here doing what i am doing is because of this\nmutation which is being foisted on the human race \u2013 it is\nbeing forced on the human race this change that the masters\nof the universe so to speak have in mind for the human race is\nbeing foisted on us and i believe again just my\nopinion that my part in this cosmic scheme or this cosmic play is to\ncall people back to their humanity and let them know you are\nbeing lead down the garden path into something you do not know\nwhat is coming you know i cannot stand it\nwhen people say that this is all high technology of our government no i do not buy that for a minute what i have seen with my\nown eyes i do not buy it for a minute if it has to do with our\ngovernment then what i have actually witnessed with my own eyes if\nit has to do with the u.s government then it means that the u.s government is in league with extraterrestrials because what i saw is\nextraterrestrial in origin but i am totally convinced\nthat there is now on the earth \u2013 again for lack of a better\nterm \u2013 alien presence which are the enemies of the human race and they are obviously enemies of whoever the original creators of us\n\u2013 because of the things i have been told that the\npeople or the entities who created us the \u201cgods who\ncreated us have enemies out there in the universe something i want to say about spielberg i have many many many\nfriends in the industry and i already know because i have been\ntold that virtually all the major names in hollywood know who i am they should i have been talking for 48 years and they are\nusing all my stuff now so they should know me so i am\nsaying that i am totally convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt for\nmyself that there are such things as reptile aliens though i have\nnever seen one thank god but i totally believe they are here \u2013\nnot because of david icke not because of credo mutwa who i love\nlistening to a wonderful fascinating man david icke has done great\nstuff but i believe there are reptile aliens here because of my own\npersonal research be aware that there is a war for your\nsoul interview begins kerry cassidy (kc jordan maxwell i am very excited to be here with you today bill ryan and i \ni am kerry cassidy from project camelot  could not be\nmore thrilled to have this honor of interviewing you you are\none of the preeminent researchers you have been on the scene for\nover 40 years i think you are really responsible for david icke\nand zecharia sitchin and numerous others coming to the fore talking\nabout secret societies the illuminati and really the powers that\nbe behind the scenes there is just no doubt that\neveryone hoagland you name it even wilcock  everyone owes you a\ngreat thank you for bringing this subject-matter to the fore and for your amazingly diligent research in this area you are\nan amazing mind you are really a national treasure if you\ndo not mind my saying so here in america and i know you have\nbeen noticed overseas in that respect as well so what do you have\nto say for yourself can you give a better introduction than that jordan maxwell (jm i would say that you are being very\ngenerous and very kind and i appreciate all your words but i view\nmyself as just an ordinary person just doing what i love to do and\nthat is to look behind the scenes of world events how things really\nwork and i started doing this kind of research diligently i\ngrew up and even as a child spending most of my time in the\nlibrary while all the other kids were out playing i was sitting in\nlibraries so i have always been interested to know things that\nother people do not seem to even know exist i have always\nbeen interested in the secret side of life all of the hidden things\nin the world that most people are not even aware of i am just\nfascinated with how much there is to know that most people do not\neven know exists and so i grew up thinking that way and by the time i was 19 years old when i ended up in los angeles i\ndecided to dedicate my whole life to studying what i would call the\nworld of the occult the word occult simply means\nhidden so much of real knowledge and wisdom is hidden\nbecause the people who run this planet feel that true knowledge and\nwisdom of how the world really works is knowledge that you do not\nneed to know \u2013 all you need to do is just go out and do your\njob and have fun and watch your basketball and stay out of the way of\nthe adults that run the world i never bought that when i\nwas a child i used to of course be happy when my family would have\nother families coming over to visit because they would bring their\nchildren and i had have kids to play with but after dinner the\nwomen would always end up in a group and they are talking women\ntalk and my dad and his brothers and whoever else was there all the\nmen would go in the front room and smoke the cigars and have the\nwine and talk men talk and so my dad and my uncles\nespecially would always say well you kids go on out and play\nball and i would tell my uncle \u2013 because dad\u2019s\nbrothers were wonderful i loved them all \u2013 and so i would tell\nmy uncles i do not want to go out and play ball i want to\nhear what you guys are talking about because i am assuming if\nyou want me to go out and play ball that you are going to be\ntalking about something that you do not want me to hear i am\nreal curious to hear what you want to talk about that you do not\nwant me to hear about and you used to say that to\nthem i assume yeah yeah so you were\nincredibly precocious and so then what they would do\nis my uncle and my dad would say well we will go out and\nplay too you know acting like okay we do not need to\ntalk about anything and of course all the kids would\nnow want to go out because my dad and my uncles are going to be\nplaying with us so we would all go out to play ball because now the\nadults were with us and of course about ten minutes into the game my dad would get tired because he works all day so he is tired\nand that kind of story so he comes in and then my uncles a few\nminutes later would come in but now the kids are all playing ball so now we are happy i see that today the president of\nthe united states goes to the opening ballgame he throws out the\nfirst ball that is daddy throwing out the first ball for all\nthe kids to be there and all the kids are watching their silly\nballgames and then of course they would shoot into the audience of\nthe ballgames and you see the movie stars and big name politicians\nthere watching the game and i had think you know i\nknow what that is it is just the guys who are running the\nplanet want all the poor people \u2013 all the kids \u2013 to know\nthat we adults who are running the world we are human like you we like to come out to the basketball game and see the ballgames it kind of makes everyone feel kind of happy that our\nnational leaders and our movie stars are like us \u2013 they love\nthe ballgames too i never fell for that i know what is going\non these guys could not care less but it is just\npolitics it is just you know go out and let the people see\nthat you are human like everyone else i never bought it i\nwanted to know about what these guys were talking about two of the clock\nin the morning when everyone else is asleep that is when these\nguys talk absolutely can you possibly feel comfortable\nenough to share what you shared with us last night about the meeting\nwith that very special person the one i know what\nyou are saying i am just trying to think am i\ncomfortable talking about it i understand well let me go on first and lay some more foundation all right so it did not take me very long to\nfigure out that so much of what is going on humans are not being\ntold we are not being told the real truth a couple of\nthings in particular i want you to know and i want you to remember nothing in this world \u2013 nothing \u2013 works the way\nyou think it does there is always more to the story you\nhear about some marriage breaking up and the husband did this the\nwife did that and it is very obvious what happened no it is\nnot obvious what happened there is a lot more to the story you\ndo not know you do not know her background her past you\ndo not know his past you do not know what was going on in\nthe family you have no idea so nothing is simple this is why you\nhave courts so i found that nothing in this world operates\nthe way you think it does banks do not loan money governments are\nnot empowered to protect you police department is not there to serve\nyou institutions of higher learning \u2013 colleges and educational\ninstitutes \u2013 are not there to educate you the entire\nsuperstructure of civilization in the western world is a combination\nof brilliantly put-together and well-planned schemes to direct the\nminds of the people in such a way as to serve their masters and i have\nknown that for a long time one of the biggest tools in the\nhands of the masters who run this world is hollywood hollywood is an\nincredible story i have said this and maybe many\nhearing me now have heard me say this but i will say it again \u2013\nthat the white man\u2019s establishment comes from europe and\nnorthern southern well all four north east south and western\neurope even at the time of the roman empire and before that whole\nsection of europe that we call the center for the white man\u2019s\npresence on the earth was quite literally ruled over \u2013 ancient\neurope was ruled over \u2013 by a priesthood called the druids the druids were the ministers the priests the judges the\nlawyers they were the religious leaders so it was\npriesthood that dominated europe it still does europe is still a\ndruidic country and america is a druidic country unless you\nunderstand the druidic system then you are never going to\nfigure out what is going on in america and england one\nof the most important symbols in the druid system was a magic wand like merlin the magician with a magic wand and also the orchestra\nleaders and conductors always have a magic wand and you had better\nplay to the tune of the master he directs you to play and he directs\nyou to stop with the magic wand so you are dancing to his\nmusic okay magic wands were always made out of the wood of\na holly tree it is made out of holly wood hollywood is a\ndruidic establishment and the symbols the words the terms the\nstories are designed think about it think about how\nhollywood does what they do i am not saying they are evil i am just explaining how hollywood works you have first of all a story so somebody has to write the story all right so now you have got a story now you have to give it to a\nscreenwriter who is going to adapt that story into a screenplay\nbecause you cannot just tell the story you have to design it to\nbe a movie now once you do that then you are going to\nhave to hire the actors \u2013 very important actors \nbecause you are going to need people to act the part it does not\nmean that they actually have human feelings no no they are\nbeing paid to act like they care to act like they love\nsomeone it is an act and so you pay actors to act out\nthe part that the screenwriters have written and you want to make\nsure the actors do it just right so you have to have a director and\nhe is going to direct everything you say and do the way he wants\nit said then you have of course the producer and he is\nalso subjected to the executive producer who is producing the\nmoney and so all of this is a whole system of putting together a\nsystem of a story that tells you a story it causes you to think in\nterms of what you just saw so that people go out from the movie and\nthink in their minds this is the way you normally would react to\na situation the way that the guy in the movie did and\nso that is why today in the western civilization especially in\nthe west our ability to work with each other and live together as\nhumans is so screwed up because we\u2018ve been watching so much\ntelevision and so many movies and so much silliness coming out of\nhollywood so much violence and sex and drugs and all the rest of\nit that people have no idea in the world how to live anymore they have lost their humanity okay so you are\nsaying that in many ways hollywood movies and television are actually\nsort of doing behavior modification on people precisely to get them to behave in certain ways to\nthink is socially acceptable and then people actually go out and they\nact the way they are \u201dsupposed to act rather than\nthe way they really feel in any human situation exactly precisely so it cements the social structure that is it i do understand that would you also talk about how movies are revealing the illuminati\nagenda oh god yes what a story that is absolutely even more so than you know even more so than you suspect i\nhave been looking at one subject for well since 1967 let me\npreface this in glendale california in 1967 i was researching\ncommunism for a lecture i was going to give and i went to a world\nbook encyclopedia and there was the picture of the national coat\nof arms of the soviet union and the soviet flag that was in \u201967 well i started speaking to small little groups in \u201960 so for seven years i had already been talking to little mom and\npop groups and little library rooms and little bookstores and all\nthat kind of thing but it was in \u201967 that i came across a\nsymbol which was the national coat of arms of the soviet union i\nwas familiar by that time with a particular term that the communists\nhave used the nazis have used the british have used the americans\nhave used and so when i saw this symbol and the explanation for the\nsymbol in the world book encyclopedia it finally hit me that\nsomething is going on on a massive enormous scale around the world for the first time i saw it in the soviet national coat of\narms because it was using the same words and terms that hitler had\nused the nazis had used that the fascists had used in italy and\nnow as i began to look the people of india used it the governments\naround the world are using the same symbol so i knew that i had\nstumbled upon something of profound significance i did not know\nwhat it was but i already knew i had a gut feeling that something\nis really big going on on the earth and the soviet national coat of\narms was what triggered my catching that bill ryan (br when you talked about the symbols there that reminded me how much of\nyour work is about the interpretation of symbols somebody mentioned\nto me that you were actually the model for the symbologist that was\nplayed by tom hanks in the movie the davinci code can you say\nanything about that is it true that that was based on your work and\nyour personality and your research well i am not\nin a position to say for sure because i am not privy to how\nthey came up with what they did in the movie all i will say that is\nfor sure and provable is that in 1991 i think it was i did a\npresentation that was videotaped in the pasadena area at a bookstore\n\u2013 and the video is out all over the world it is called\nthe basic slide presentation in that \u2013 that was\nback in 1991 pasadena \u2013 i was introduced as an expert on\nsecret societies and occult emblems and symbols of religion and\ngovernment i walked up onto the stage and it was a slide\npresentation that i was doing and so i had the slide projector on and the slide that was being projected on the screen \u2013 i left\nit on even before i started just to have a picture for people to see\nwhen they came in \u2013 so the slide projector was already on the\npicture that was on the screen was the back of the dollar bill the\npyramid on the back of the dollar bill when i walked up onto the\nplatform i walked in front of the screen so now it was being\nprojected on me that was in the movie and\nthen i started pointing to the symbols on the dollar bill [kerry\nlaughs] and explaining the emblems or words that is exactly the\nsame scene that is in the movie i remember it it\nwas very dramatic if you recall yeah go back and get\nmy basic slide presentation back in \u201991 and it is\nthe same identical thing imitation is the sincerest\nform of flattery right i guess of course i did not\nget a check or anything and then of course in 1992 or \u201993 something like that i did a video called matrix of power in\nwhich i talked about how the world is being manipulated behind the\nscenes by occult or magical symbols and words that are deceiving\ncivilization deceiving people then later on a movie comes out\ncalled matrix but i have been talking about this you\nknow this subject for many many years before now one\nthing a lot of people do not know is that i was going around it can\nbe told now but i was going around to studios in the \u201970s and\nin the early \u201980s especially in the \u201970s i was going\naround to all the motion picture studios at nighttime working-class\npeople in the studios would have me come in and do a presentation \u2013\na slide projector just a little mickey mouse operation slide\nprojector throw up a screen and i would give lectures on bible\ncodes knights templars secret societies and those kind of arcane\nsubjects many times i would give lectures like that to just\nthe working-class people of the studio and then sometimes we would\nrent some office within the studio lot where i could go and sit and\ntalk with a bunch of people who were working at the studio i was\njust having fun talking about things i enjoy you know they would\norder beer and pizza we had sit and talk and i would do a two-\nor three-hour slide presentation on bible codes secret societies in \u201966 late \u201966 as i said before i learned\nabout the illuminati as such and so i started giving lectures at the\nstudios on illuminati masonic orders both the british grand lodge\nand the american freemasonry the french and german orders and tying\nthem all into the secret societies that operate around the globe \nand also incorporating in those lectures as i said in the \u201970s the subject of illuminati which i had gotten from anthony hilder\u2019s\nrecords that were put out in 1966 and so today i see you\nknow on television on history channel and all kinds of movies from\nhollywood talking about illuminati this actually comes\nfrom your research it is percolated itself down into the\npopular culture well i mean if you just keep talking\nfor 48 years somebody\u2019s going to finally hear you somewhere well it is very possible that they were\nactually filming and taping you at the studio well i\nknow they did actually they were doing it but it was like\nindividuals would have their cameras and would videotape and they\nwould audiotape but even behind the scenes there could\nhave been recording going on who knows yeah i mean obviously a lot of what you talked about has shown up\nin plot-lines in screenplays and then in movies oh\nyeah absolutely so maybe we can go back again to where\nyou got involved you were talking about the soviet crest and maybe\nwe could pick up there yeah so this was in \u201967 1967 as i said i am in glendale california i was researching\nthe communist movement and so i went to the world book\nencyclopedia and there in the world book encyclopedia was\na picture of the national coal of arms of the soviet union and the\ncommunist flag i already understood the symbols of the\ncommunist flag but my eye caught that national coat of arms and i\nsaw in that symbol something i had seen the nazis use  all the\ngreat nations of the world have used all the presidents of the\nunited states in their inaugural addresses used the same words and\nterms all the senators and congressmen when they are running\nfor office use that same term that same symbol so i knew i\nhad stumbled upon something of profound significance i just did not\nknow what it meant but i knew it was important this was in \u201967 and so since \u201967 i have been researching this one\nterm this one symbol and the more i find on it the more i am\namazed at how much there is out there on this one secret symbol that\nnobody is aware that it is right in front of you it is one\nof those incredibly fantastic stories of something that is so awesome\nin scope and it is sitting right in front of you and you never\nsaw it that is how clever these guys are so what\nare you talking about we are going to put it on the screen it is two mountains and a rising sun is that right right so what are the words and what does this mean but lookit just to be able to see it which you will\nbe able to put into the video but just to be able to see it is not\nsufficient you need about 25 or 30 years of research to understand\nthe significance of what you are seeing and what it\nactually means so you will be able to show it and it will be\nsomething of interest that people will pick up on but believe me there is a bigger story yet so when you are\nhearing the term illuminati or the concepts of secret\nsocieties occult orders and all that kind of thing it is\nactually much bigger than you think there is something far bigger\ngoing on on the earth that most people are not aware of okay the rising sun are we talking about the rising sun are we\ntalking about the rising of the new world order that is\nright exactly we are also talking about something\nelse are not we yes that is right something very big something more occult even than\nthat something that goes all the way back into b.c back into the ancient world zecharia sitchin and i have talked about\nthis at one time i was in business with zecharia sitchin i helped\nsend him to different countries and we were going to do a television a 13-week mini-special i was going to do with zach zecharia\nsitchin has been my dear friend and a brilliant man and i was so\nimpressed with him  i talked him into signing a contract with\nme to do a 13-week mini-series for television unfortunately the\nattorneys and the people who were financing the project for me at\nthe last minute after we had already shot like five different\ncountries and we were almost through they pulled the plug on the\nwhole project so it was not zach\u2019s fault it was not\nmy fault it was the people financing it they faltered but\ni have had a lot of opportunities to talk to zecharia about\nthings that i am interested in and i have learned a lot\ntalking to him in private which will unfortunately have to stay\nprivate okay so you are not able to tell anything\nabout something that he told you that was actually very significant no it is just that the symbol i am talking about is on\nthe national coat of arms of the soviet union so i would say anyone\nwho is interested in this look at the symbols on the national\ncoat of arms and study it do not just look at it but\nlook at all the implications of it and then follow the others\npictures that i have that i will give you each one\u2019s a step\ncloser and another step closer to it and it keeps going i think\nthere is about six or seven pictures okay but it\nalso links up with the japanese the use of the red sun also the sun\nthat was in obama\u2019s inauguration in the background exactly david wilcock (dw what about in pittsburgh the\ng-20 summit it is like a grid i know that is the same thing but is not there some\noccult significance to the sun itself of course there\nis and are we talking about something to do with the\nanunnaki as well and their agenda yes yes absolutely that is exactly what it is about there is a\nhidden agenda that is been in operation on this earth for\nthousands of years and see i am at a disadvantage because i am\ntrying to explain something to an audience who have not been where\ni have been and seen what i have and so i am having a\ndifficulty trying to legitimize what i am saying if you have not\nseen what i have seen and so okay well that is\npart of the purpose of the interview i mean we are camelot we have\na lot of background information already on our site as you know and\nso in many ways the people that are watching this they will have\nbeen already educated if they were not to begin with by\ncamelot by the other people that have come before you i understand but i think it is very significant\nthat we are talking now and i think that what we have\ntouched on here is like this is the beginning of a revealing that\nmost people are not aware of yes and\nobviously you have got that story okay i tell you no matter how well prepared and how well-read you are i will\nguarantee you you have not heard this story okay i have a story no one\u2019s heard and i have been\nlooking at it for some since \u201967 so we are talking\nabout how many years is that 67 to 2007 that is what 40 years yes yeah yeah absolutely and when did you actually stumble on the final i feel\nlike in a sense you have the full meaning of it at this stage i\nthink that perhaps you have that full meaning so i am asking\nyou in a sense when did you arrive there how many years ago did\nyou actually get to the i think probably somewhere in\nthe mid \u201990s it began to really dawn on me okay yeah and dawn has something to do with it that is right we are also talking about we are talking about an ancient ancient story that\nhas been the golden dawn we are talking\nabout the golden dawn and the information there absolutely but what much further back the golden dawn was just one more step in a continuing flow of\na particular idea and as it moves into the last days of the world\nthat we are living in we are now entering into a new\ndispensation \u2013 i choose that term \u2013 dispensation of\ntime in which this symbol is going to be everywhere okay and  i would like to be able to give like a\ntwo-and-a-half to three-hour presentation just on this one symbol a rather successful motion picture producer and i were\ntalking about doing a movie after i gave him some of the\ninformation he called it let us call the movie the symbol and then we talked about it and said well maybe the\nhidden symbol i have the contract and here\u2019s the movie\nthat we want to do and we will call it the symbol or the\nhidden symbol that never got done for all kinds of\nreasons but then i see the new movie coming out with dan brown the\nhidden symbol and i am thinking these guys who\nare smart intelligent and hollywood they are either knowledgeable\non this symbol and are releasing it slowly but surely or there is\nsome kind of an understanding going on that people are starting to\nlook at symbols more now and beginning to put the pieces together like i have been doing for 48 years and now they are beginning\nto perceive what i am talking about but they have not\ngot there yet and so it is a form of professional\njealousy i would like to be the one that presents my work before\nwarner brothers gets ahold of it from somebody else exactly i mean here\u2019s your opportunity so anything you hold\nback at this point i mean really you do so at your own risk in a\nsense i understand because this is an\nopportunity and we are really coming close to the juncture \u2013 i\nmean 2012 and beyond \u2013 where this agenda is really coming to\nthe fore i know and it is just incredible watching it it is amazing that you have been\nwatching this thing with full awareness as each step each\nroll-out for 40 years i have been watching it\ncoming and so take us down the path all\nthe presidents of the united states \u2013 all of them \u2013 have\nused the same terms from george washington the terms he used and\nthe things he said were taken directly from the ancient prehistoric\nworld of the anunnaki the ancient gods from the ancient sumerians babylonians phoenician-canaanites ancient greece ancient rome they all the used the same word and the same term okay what is the term what are the terms the term is the\ndawn of the new day and the concept of the dawn of a new day\nis the sun rising between two mountains this goes back to\nthe beginning of christianity in the 4th century when constantine\ncodified the religion called christianity christianity is nothing\nmore than in my opinion christianity is the most popular\nrendition of the ancient cult story this ancient thing that for\nthousands of years has been hidden from people but the masters of\nthe world the kings and rulers have all understood christianity\nis telling you the same story but you do not see it so people\nare fixated on jesus and on his ministry and never for a moment\nsuspect that the entire story is the same ancient story that is\nbeen told by so many ancient cultures and is today part of the new\nworld order illuminati masonic orders around the earth the\nentire superstructure of western civilization has bought into this\nmost ancient story never realizing for a moment what they are\ndoing okay i have some clues along the lines of this and i have to say you are really talking about the rise of the\nson of anu exactly i do not\nknow if it is marduk but it is orion the son of orion can you tell us now you are getting close that is\nright okay this is him coming back actually to sit\non the throne and to rule the world mm hm and so maybe you can sort of start to paint that picture now is he\ncoming in a craft well do not know maybe i\nwould not be a bit surprised if they are already here just\nwaiting okay they do not have to\ncome they are already here that is what steven spielberg\nsaid in his war of the worlds they are not coming they are already here and they popped up from out under the\nstreet symbolically what hollywood and steven spielberg are saying they are right under your feet they are right under the\nsurface well according to bob dean they are\nwalking the halls of the pentagon i would not be a\nbit surprised yeah so we certainly have witness\ntestimony in that area i am going to do a\npresentation on this very soon i already have about a 3-hour\npresentation all ready to go that i want to explain it okay but this ruler coming to kind of take control is this a\npositive thing in your view or a negative thing i think\nnegative okay i think very negative but\nthe whole world is sucking it up they love it never realizing the\nfull implications of what is being said it is like\nsome kids going into hollywood you know leaving home and they are\ngoing to hollywood they are going to be in the motion picture\ncapital of the world never realizing that on the streets of\nhollywood and this city is not some place for an innocent kid you are\ngetting yourself involved with something you have no idea in the\nworld how bad it really is i think that so many people have\nbought into the different religions orders \u2013 jehovah\u2019s\nwitnesses christadelphia worldwide church of god  mormon\nchurch all of these are part and parcel of a larger world movement\nthat is been planned for a long time and where the\nworld especially in the western world i am talking mostly in\nthe western world because the arabic world is also heavily involved\nin this but that is a different subject but for the moment western civilization is just going over the wall with this thing everybody has bought into it you are seeing it in politics okay it is in the japanese flag so there has to\nbe some acquiescence there with china and all you know oh yeah absolutely they are all using it and they are\nall buying into this whole new order of the world never realizing\nwhat this actually implies you know the very term novus\nordo seclorum on the back of the dollar bill that comes from the\nroman poet virgil in ancient rome there was a poet that was\nappointed by the court of rome to write poetry for caesar and of\ncourse if you are going to write poetry for caesar you want to\nwrite something nice that he will like so virgil in one of\nhis poems called aeneid wrote about the time when there would\ncome a great world ruler in the seat of caesar but this ruler would\nbe awesome in power to be far more than any man could ever be that\ntime when he would come the sun would rise on the novus ordo\nseclorum a new world order and when that one comes it would be\nthe beginning of a whole new civilization the term that virgil used\nin latin was novus ordo seclorum a new order of the world now when you get into the subject now you have to get to\nthe hebrew and jewish religion where judaism comes from where\nchristianity comes from where islam actually comes from and trace\nback like zecharia sitchin has done for us and he is not the\nonly one there are many who have written on this subject of the\nancient world and the symbols and words and terms and theology that is\ncome down to us for thousands of years there is just so\nmuch we could talk about that without pictures without the ability\nto show the audience what i am talking about it is a\nlittle difficult but i am going to be doing a series on it i have already got it pretty well okay but\nbasically we are talking about the beginning of a reign with\nthis king who is a sun  and he is basically going\nto take control of the world right of the whole earth yeah and and the destiny of the human\nfamily \u2013 period okay and do you know where that\ndestiny is headed in other words what is unique about this son\n and his proclivities his point of view where he is\ncoming from that is different from what we have had before i think that the agenda of this one who is to come is to\nmutate the human race i believe that is what is the agenda is to\nmutate the human race \u2013 not necessarily evolution though i\nbelieve that evolution has its place in the world i think\nthat there are things which do evolve and i am not talking\nabout man coming from monkeys because obviously man did not come\nfrom monkeys  man is evolving into monkeys and so that is the problem there is a place for evolution but\nthat is not what i am talking about this ancient\nstory coming from the ancient and prehistoric world has dominated\nall the cultures of the world what that implies i believe is there is going to be some kind of a mutation of the human\nrace in order to take the human family on the earth to a new style of\nlife in the universe and so what will be lost will be your\nhumanity your ability to show love and kindness to other\npeople there will be no room for that emotions \u2013 there will\nbe no room for emotions there will be no room for the american\nsystem of freedom liberty and justice for all that is gone that is out there will be no more freedom liberty and justice\nfor all no more family love no more humanity man reacting to man no all of that is going to be gone are not\nyou also saying though that there is a race of humans being actually that this is not going to start in the future that\nit is already started oh yeah it is already\nstarted the preparation the genetic modification of\nthe human actually behind the scenes yes you know in the book of genesis in the bible the old testament in genesis 18 the 18th chapter  i did a video on this  it talks about abraham\nand sarah the prophet abraham it says that three men \u2013 in\ngenesis 18 go back to read it yourself \u2013 it says that three\nmen come walking up into the camp abraham went out and\ngreeted the three men and asked them to stay for dinner and they said\nno they were on their way to other business and did not have time to\nstop it says that abraham insisted that they stay at least to have\nsomething to eat and then they could go and they agreed so they\nsaid all right make it quick we will stay for something and so the bible says in genesis 18 that sarah his wife fixed dinner for them they sat under a tree had dinner with\nabraham then it says after dinner two of the men got up and left to\ngo on about their business but the one that stayed was the absolute\ncreator god the one who had created the human creature he sat with\nabraham having dinner under the tree and then gave prophecies to\nabraham and then got up and left now that is in genesis 18 first of all my question is wait a minute it says\nthere were three men and the three men come up and had\ndinner with abraham and then in genesis 19 the following\nchapter it says that those two men who had gotten up earlier\nand left were the two angels that went into sodom and\ngomorrah it says that when these two angels or men went into\nsodom and gomorrah the homosexuals saw these guys these two men and thought that they were absolutely handsome beautiful good-looking men and they attracted the homosexuals go read it in\ngenesis 19 but that tells me if those were the same two men\nthat were with abraham having dinner the scripture said they were\nabsolutely handsome good-looking handsome men and god the\ncreator is still sitting under the tree with abraham having\ndinner and it says god in all capital letters the creator of the\nhuman race is there with abraham so i am just saying\nthat i am sure that there are spiritual interpretations of all\nthis but i think there is a legitimacy about the story that when we\nread in genesis where god walked with adam and eve in the cool of the\nevening the word in hebrew \u2013 god walked with adam \u2013\nthat hebrew word means you can hear a footstep stepping on leaves you can hear the footsteps that is what the hebrew\nword means so we poetically say well god probably was with adam\nand eve spiritually no no the word in hebrew says god\nwalked with adam you can hear his footsteps on the leaves all\nof this implies in the old testament that whoever created us looked\nlike us and that is why the scriptures says god says come let us make man in our image after our likeness that is in\ngenesis one genesis one and two both many years ago i\ntalked with rabbi marvin antelman rabbi marvin antelman from\nmassachusetts was a dear friend of mine i think he is still\nalive today in the knesset in israel but he and i used to talk long\nhours and i asked him once about that scripture come let us\nmake man in our image after our likeness he said both\njews and christians misunderstand that scripture because they gloss\nover it too quickly most people think that when they read that\nscripture that god is saying come let us make a creature and we\nwill call him man well first of all you gotta ask who\nis god talking to himself he is saying come let us who is us so he says come let us make man in our\nimage after our likeness he said no that is not\nthe way to translate it correctly he is saying the correct\nunderstanding is god is saying to someone come let us make man in\nour image after our likeness \u2013 not make man no no man\u2019s already here but come let us re-form mutate man let us make man in our image after our likeness and\nlater on in genesis it says man has now becomes as one of us now\nhe looks like us so if that is true then that means today \u2013\nand i am totally convinced that this is the case \u2013 we have\nentities here from somewhere else angels gods whatever you want to\ncall them zecharia sitchin called them anunnaki but i am\ntotally convinced for my own self that there are alien life forms\nhere who look like humans and yet they are not fully human and of course in genesis we are told that there is\na world of difference we understand in the book of genesis there is\na world of difference between an angel and the sons of god sons of\ngod are not angels and angels are not sons of god \u2013 totally\ndifferent concept totally different words sons of god are\nspirit entities or entities from somewhere who look and have physical\nbodies and look like humans they are called sons of god while\nangels are spirit entities so we are told in the bible again going back to genesis that the sons of god were messing around\nwith women and got them pregnant well i kind of figured that these\nsons of god their plumbing worked the same way so therefore they\ncould get women pregnant and i cannot imagine a woman being talked\ninto bed by some hideous creature from another world but i can see\nit if it is a handsome good-looking man well that is\nwhat the bible said even the homosexuals said they were beautiful handsome men all of this i am bringing out as biblical\nreference for my conclusion that i think zecharia sitchin is right i think other people who have written about this same subject are\nright that there are in fact entities here \u2013 life forms here \u2013\nthat have come here from somewhere else maybe they were the\noriginals and they are today in my humble opinion the people who\nare running this planet it would not surprise me a bit are these the nephilim i do not know they could\nbe the nephilim because not all the nephilim died at the flood a lot\nof christians will tell you all the nephilim died in the flood no that is not what the bible says it says that there was one of\nthe nephilim lived through the flood his name was og of bashan og\nof bashan was one of the nephilim and he lived through the flood and\ncould reproduce and reproduce more like himself we know that\nthere have been skeletons found way down in the earth around the\nworld that are far bigger than we humans are today some of them are\n16 feet long some of them 20 feet long 12 feet long so i am\nsure that there have been extraterrestrial for lack of a better\nterm extraterrestrial life forms who have come here who we\nlook like them they do not look like us they created us in their image and likeness okay but\nthis new sort of ruler is the sun  of god right he is\ngoing to be ruling in other words between these two mountains now\ni am wondering what the mountains are symbolizing yeah very good because the mountains are we talking\nabout the soviet union and the u.s are those the mountains where\nthe sun  is going to rise between those two mountains or\nare we talking about planets i think that we are\ntalking about something deeper the implications being that in all of\nthe ancient world there was always a concept and theologies of all\nthe ancient cultures of the world used it of twin towers twin\nthings twin churches twin towers that is why that whole thing\nabout in new york twin towers that is in-your-face if you\nunderstand the symbolism of twin towers in the roman empire and the\ngrecian empire in sumeria babylonia especially in egypt \u2013\nthey always had the two obelisks they always had the two towers always so there is a very powerful significance to the concept of\ntwin towers very important symbolism okay so we have\ngot twins and we have got basically gemini and how does that\nwork in are we talking about i do not know when this\nso-called god was born are we talking about the constellation when\nhis rule will begin i think it will probably be when he\ncomes into power this will be his symbol his symbol will be the sun\nrising between the mountains of the east zecharia sitchin talks\nabout that many of the books on the ancient middle eastern\nreligions have pictures of shamash the hebrew god is shamash meaning the sun rising between the mountains of the east that goes\nall the way back to the cuneiform pictures the clay pictures from\nsumeria and babylonia or from iraq pictures of the god rising\nbetween two mountains again it is very difficult for me to\nmake this intelligently understood because i do not have the\npictures and it would take me about three hours to lay the\nfoundation for this i understand so i am\njust giving you some brief glimpses into what i am going to be\ndoing soon on this video okay is this ruler are we\ntalking about marduk or is marduk already here and this is somebody\nwho is coming after him i am not sure about\nthat okay but again i would say it all\nboils down to one thing in my mind \u2013 that the human race on the\nearth is being prepared slowly but surely in a scientific method\nbeing applied to the human race to mutate the human race to change\nus from being what we are today to a creature that the gods have in\nmind mutating again because if the bible is correct if zecharia\nsitchin\u2019s correct and all the other writers on the subject are\ncorrect this is a real detective story here i am\non the edge of my seat thinking wow are we talking about the\nreturn of the anunnaki is this connected with the christian myth\nof a second coming that is right this particular video is not really for you know people that are\njust coming to the subject this actually is for people who have a cursory understanding of all this a\nbackground and do understand and have possibly read sitchin\u2019s\nwork for example and are up to speed with even david icke\u2019s\nwork and our work right and who may have\nbeen following you for many years because in recent interviews for\nexample on coast to coast for example you hinted heavily\nthat there are things which you are not ready to say yet yes and a lot of people will be watching this wondering whether this is the time and you have chosen to tell\nall yeah that is true yeah what we\nhave established here is that there is a very predominant symbol and\nyou have talked about how it is permeated every aspect of\nlife and religion and that people are really not up to speed on what\nit really means for the human race absolutely that is\nright and this is sort of a stunning revelation for\nmany people that are listening to this but i would like to say what\nwe are seeing right now is a roll-out of an illuminati agenda that\ninvolves population reduction what i am curious is whether or\nnot you can talk about how this agenda to do with the son [and/or\nsun] coming to the throne of the world if indeed this transpires the creation of a new race of humans right and how population reduction folds into that well i\nthink if you are going to have a whole new race of humans they\nare cultured that is why we refer to different races of\npeople as \u201ccultures and a culture is something under a\nmicroscope you know it is like a bacteria and so that is\nwhat we are on the earth \u2013 we are a culture and somebody has\nactually put us here as a culture and is watching us grow and we\nhave become a disease because we are killing everything in our\npath and so i think that whoever it is that has created us\nhad created us i believe possibly already knew that in the far\nfuture once this race is finally brought up to speed and then we\ncan move it into the next plateau this is what the nazis were\ntalking about this is what wernher von braun was talking about the\nnazis were big on this subject and using the symbol and the term that\ni am talking about the symbol between the mountains of the\neast england \u2013 interesting about this is england has\nalways had a fixation on egypt england\u2019s big on egypt go to\nthe british museum and all these different museums the english were\nalways big on egypt but the germans were not the germans\nwere always big on iraq that is what germany was interested in\n\u2013 babylon and the reason why i think is because the nazis\nand the german people in general or at least the intelligentsia of\nthe german establishment realized this story that i am trying\nto explain has to do with babylon it has to do with iraq and i\nbelieve that may be one of the reasons why the u.s is in iraq today absolutely it has something to do with\nsome and i know this is true because i can prove that the symbols\nwhich are being used by the u.s government today in iraq is exactly\nthe same symbols that i was telling you about that comes from the\nanunnaki from the phoenician-canaanites the assyrians the\nphoenicians ancient greece ancient rome ancient britannia into\namerica the entire superstructure of civilization has been\nusing the same words and terms and symbols that are today dominating\nin iraq but most people do not even know they do not even\nsee it i understand it is hidden in\nplain sight okay but there is a stargate in iraq\nthat is fairly well known that saddam hussein apparently they\nhad to get rid of him because he had found it and was able to control\nit while he was in power yeah so in\nessence the u.s is never it is been my theory that the u.s is never going to leave iraq because basically they have to man that\nstargate they have to have control of that stargate which is where\nit is said the anunnaki will return through that stargate have you heard that theory well yeah i have absolutely and one of my favorite speakers on that subject is\nwilliam henry william and i have been around the world together went to egypt together we talked a long time about stargates i\nunderstand the story i did not say anything about stargates that is william henry\u2019s work that influenced me in that\ndirection but i am aware that hollywood is talking about stargates\nand making movies about it i did a lecture series with al\nbielek and preston nichols i did two weekend seminars in which the\nthree of us spoke together back in philadelphia and i had some time\nto sit and talk with preston nichols incidentally i am highly\nimpressed with preston nichols okay you\nhave to be highly impressed with that man when you sit and talk with\nhim because he is a very very interesting man he is got a lot\nof very good information on the kind of thing i am talking about\nin private with him and he was enlightening me to some of the things\ni am seeing and saying but he is heavily\ninvolved in the montauk story absolutely and the philadelphia experiment being the early precursor of that and then also time travel which is where montauk was headed exactly and then you get into the stargates and so on and this has something to do with letting in \u2013 i am\ntheorizing here so i want you to help me \u2013 but my\nunderstanding with the montauk project was that there were some\nopenings made in not just the timeline but also in space so to\nspeak where certain races were able to come in through an open door basically that was created by the montauk project yeah i am wondering if that has to do with the\ngenetic engineering of our planet such that they were coming in to\ndo a job well yeah i think all of that has some\nvalidity i do not know that much about the stargate itself\nconcept i understand it but i mean that is not my subject but it plays into my subject it is part of it and it must be\nimportant because hollywood\u2019s making movies about it all the\ntime they actually have television shows \u2013 stargate so\ni am sure there is something very legitimate about the\nconcept all i am saying is that when i was talking and\nspent two weekends with al bielek and preston nichols and myself i\nwas very impressed with both al bielek and preston nichols because in my opinion sitting with them for hours on end and working with\nthem over the weekend both of them are extremely interesting provocative people i was having fun downloading all this stuff to\npreston and he is saying yeah well here\u2019s something\nelse you did not see and so i have the\nhighest regard for him that is wonderful to hear actually because i do think there is great validity there and some\nvery important clues i think preston nichols is\nabsolutely sensational i love everything i loved he was such a\ngracious person helpful kind courteous and brilliant to sit and\ntalk with so i love preston nichols i hear you now what about zecharia sitchin when he talks about the anunnaki there\nwas a group of the anunnaki that went to mars that left this planet and actually some of which i guess came from wherever the anunnaki\ncame from and never actually made it here so there is a group\nthat kind of went back to mars and then some that came from according to sitchin i am saying so what i am\nwondering is what was going on with mars we know that hoagland has\ngone down that road quite a distance but i think that you have\ngiven him many of the clues and the basis for his work there is\nsomething to do with now i am not an expert on this but i\ndo understand that the positioning of the great pyramid and the\nsignificance with the association with mars and then of course we are talking about babylon and babylon and mars are symbols\nfor the same thing is not this right and the whore of\nbabylon and there is something going on there that is right that is what i am talking about maybe you could talk about that a little bit about mars and the\nsignificance with the anunnaki and where that might be leading and the very word cairo as you probably know cairo means\nmars exactly another word for mars\nis cairo so what is going on with that yeah that is a subject which richard is probably better suited to\ntalk about than i because i really have not looked at mars over\nand above the general kind of stuff he talks about but i totally\nbelieve for myself that mars is inhabited and i do believe that\nthere are probably humans like us there quite a long time\nago i had a long conversation in mesa arizona with virgil armstrong\npostlethwaite virgil armstrong and i sat in a restaurant in mesa arizona many years ago and talked about the people who are on mars virgil was a guy from what i gather was the man who came up\nwith the idea \u2013 he was a military/cia operative \u2013 and\nhe is the guy that came up with the idea for green berets that\nwas his idea green beret and he worked with the cia i loved\nsitting and talking with virgil armstrong but he brought out in that\nconversation how there were many thousands of people or more like\nus \u2013 humans like us \u2013 on mars at that time and i\nwould not be a bit surprised what year was this\nthat you were talking to him this was probably mid\n\u201980s amazing i would say \u201985 86 87 something like that okay well\nthat does dovetail also with our experience with our witness henry\ndeacon arthur neumann is his real name and he has come out under\nthat name recently and said he is been to mars so i am\nwondering if you have any information that is come to you about\njumpgates about going between planets well yes and\nno the only thing i have of any value is someone else\u2019s work i sat and talked with him and he is a very very knowledgeable very\nlegitimately he worked for the united states naval observatory he\nwas in charge of the naval observatory and he just passed away just\nrecently but his website is so extraordinary the stuff he has on\nthat website pictures of strange things found on mars \u2013 and\nthey are not nebulous things they are in your face i\nmean those tubes plexiglas tubes yes amazing and lights in those tubes there is just an enormous amount of\nstuff he has on his website well our attention was\ndrawn to that by henry deacon as well to those tubes which is\nfascinating yeah right you know i always say i am\nnot the world\u2019s foremost authority on anything if there is\nany value in my person and my work i would say this that i have\nbeen privileged to be in the company of extraordinary people doing\nextraordinary work i have been privileged to sit in their company\nand be accepted by them and be able to learn things behind the scenes\nthat other people will never be privy to hear is not\nit true though that you were told that you have a mission that is\ngoing to come to the fore late in life yeah and that you might actually be there now do you want to tell that\nstory at all yeah i suppose so i mentioned this i\nthink on coast to coast once but it was very quick because\ngeorge wants to hear all the stories as long as it is within a\nminute and a half we have longer than\nthat yeah but when i was 19 i ended up in\nlos angeles \u2013 at 19 years old with seven bucks in my pocket incidentally i had no idea where i was going where i was i ended\nup in los angeles on a friday night with seven dollars in my pocket you know i was a stupid kid but i lived through it later\non a couple months later after i got a job and things were working\nout for me i was in north hollywood one morning on a weekend\nmorning and i went into a restaurant the place was crowded and\nthere was only one seat available and that was at the counter so i\nsat at the counter there was a young girl sitting next to me so we\nstarted talking come to find out she only lived about two\nblocks from me and i only lived about two blocks from town so she\nhad walked downtown and i had also so we started hanging out\ntogether i had meet her downtown we had hang out together this was back in \u201959 and i was 19 years old when we\nwould walk home i lived two blocks closer so she had two blocks\nfarther to go so i never knew exactly where she lived but she knew\nwhere i lived one night she came over to my place and said my\ndad wants to see you he wants to talk to you and of\ncourse that put me on alert i\nsa\u00a0 i do not want to talk to your dad she\nsa\u00a0 no my father is a very important and interesting man he\nwants to talk to you he is got something to tell you that sounded interesting so i went with her and when we\nwalked up to the house which was only a couple of blocks away we\nwalked up to the house just by chance he happened to be coming out\nof the house the moment i saw him an incredible feeling\ncame over me of some kind of a euphoric strange  wonderful\nfeeling that i got being in his presence it was as if i were in the\npresence of a great prophet or some spiritual man i felt it and i\nloved the feeling i mean i cannot describe it but i loved the\nfeeling it was an other-world feeling i noticed that he was very\nmuch in control of himself he knew exactly what he was doing he\nmotioned for us to come in we went in and the girls sat on the floor\nby the fireplace they sat on the floor he sat on one end of the\nsofa i sat on the other end of the sofa the wife was in the\nkitchen i never did see her that whole night so we were\ntalking and he was you know he was asking me how i liked living in\ncalifornia and do you have a job and how do you like your\njob and just small talk and i was beginning to feel a little of\nthe apprehension was going away i was beginning to feel a little bit\nbetter being in his company but i knew there was something about\nthis guy that was not right but i loved the feeling i am\n19 years old so i am not sure what i am doing but i am\njust talking to this guy who is dazzling me with his presence of\nmind and the presence he presented and so we are\ntalking about all kinds of things and then when he felt that i was\nsufficiently at ease he said to me very nonchalantly he said remember when you were eight years old back in florida and your\nfather built the new back porch and your uncle helped him and\nremember your dad used green lumber that smelled funny and he built\nthe new back porch you remember that tears started to\ncome to my eyes and i did not want to show tears in front of my\ngirlfriend but he was scaring me because he was right and he knew\nit and he said to \u00a0 well did that happen or did not\nit i sa\u00a0 yes that happened and he\nsa\u00a0 also one night when you were in bed you got out of bed\nand you went out on the back porch and you were looking at the moon\nand the moon was full do you remember that and i sa\u00a0\nyes i remember that and he sa\u00a0 and you were\npicking the wood because it smelled funny it was green lumber it\nsmelled funny and you were picking it with your finger remember how\nyou picked a piece of it and you were smelling it and tasting it and\nhe sa\u00a0 remember doing that and now i am\nreally scared because it is frightening to me and i sa\u00a0 yes he sa\u00a0 well did you do that or did not you i sa\u00a0 yes i did and he sa\u00a0 well how would i know that how would i know what you did and\ni sa\u00a0 i do not know how you had know he\nsa\u00a0 i know because we were there you just did not see us but we were there watching you and i thoug\u00a0 well and he said because he could tell i was not buying\n\u00a0 was i correct in what i said yeah he\nsa\u00a0 well how would i know if i was not there we\nwere there i sa\u00a0 who was we he sa\u00a0\nthat is not important right now what is important for\nyou to know is that you are in california because we brought\nyou here we brought you here to los angeles i sa\u00a0\nyou brought me here he sa\u00a0 yeah why are\nyou here i sa\u00a0 i do not know why i am\nhere i just had to come to los angeles he sa\u00a0 that is\nright we brought you here he said because what did you say\nto god you talked to god that night the night you sat on the porch you said something to god what did you say i just sat\nlooking at him he sa\u00a0 i will tell you what you\nsaid you asked god to let you do something important with your life you wanted to do something of value and importance with your life and i was about eight or nine years old right i\nsa\u00a0 yes that is what i said he sa\u00a0 well then we are going to give you an opportunity to do something\nwith your life now because you did ask i am still\namazed listening to him and he sa\u00a0 what we have for\nyou to do will not happen until the later part of your life and i am\nnot going to go into it right now he sa\u00a0 i am\nnot going to go into explaining it to you now however when the time\ncomes for you to do what we have brought you here to do  you will\nknow what you have to do by that time you will be sufficiently\nknowledgeable on who you are and what you are doing and where\nyou are going and he sa\u00a0 all you need to know\nnow is that we brought you here and that we will protect you wherever\nit is that we put you and i asked him i sa\u00a0 i\nstill do not understand what you are saying he\nsa\u00a0 you do not need to but one day you will understand and he sa\u00a0  so i am here to start you on your\njourney he sa\u00a0 i have a book i am going to\ngive you and i want you to read the book and that will begin your\njourney and he pulls it off the shelf and gives it to\nme and today you can still get that book in bookstores anywhere it is called the complete works of charles fort spells\nname even in england there is a fortean society\ndedicated to the work of charles fort a fascinating book it is\na monumental work very thick book the complete works of charles\nfort and he opened the book indiscriminately just put\nhis hand on the pages because it is a very thick book and he\nopens a page and he reads a paragraph he just opened the page and\nreads a paragraph \u2013 he knew exactly what he was doing precisely what he was doing i did not know because it looked\nlike he just indiscriminately opened it and he read a paragraph that\njust blew me away i was knocked out by what he had just read and\ni thoug\u00a0 wow that is interesting and he\nsa\u00a0 oh yeah the book is filled with that kind of thing let me\nread you another one he opened it up again and just\nindiscriminately read something not indiscriminately he knew what\nhe was doing i am sure that he knew how to get your particular\nattention what would be very interesting to you i may not even see but he knew how to play on my emotions and he read about three\nlittle paragraphs one after the other and each one \u2013 to me \u2013\nwas absolutely mind-blowing i was fascinated with him with\nmy new girlfriend and with this book and\nthen he said to \u00a0 you have always been interested in ufos\nand other-worldly things right and i sa\u00a0 yes i\nhave he sa\u00a0 would you like to see some ufos up\nclose tonight and i sa\u00a0 i had love to he sa\u00a0 well come on i can do that for you so\ni got up with him and the two girls \u2013 my girlfriend and her\nsister \u2013 the four of us came out in the yard it was about\nmaybe midnight in north hollywood 1959 and he looks up into the sky\nand starts inaudibly talking his mouth is moving as if he is\ntalking to somebody but you cannot hear him and as i am\nwatching him standing there talking to the stars i look over at my\ngirlfriend and she is looking at me and\nthe look on her face was li\u00a0 yeah this is my father that is\nhim told you he was strange did not i and that\nkind of thing and her sister was looking at me and i could\ntell what she was doing she\nwas trying to figure o\u00a0 how is he taking this you\nknow what is going on in my mind what the little one was\nthinking because she is seen this before she wants to see how\ni am going to react to this and so ten he looks at me\nand he sa\u00a0 they said that they will be coming from griffith\npark in just a minute there\u2019ll be three of them and they will\nbe coming from the griffith park area they are going north and\nthey said that they will be here in a minute for you and\ni sa\u00a0 who is they he sa\u00a0 you will\nsee within a couple of minutes three beautiful\ndisk-shaped things glowing very faintly glowing came over with no\nsound whatsoever in a triangle formation came over and stopped\nright above our heads and stopped and when they did you\ncould see they were disk-shaped and it looked and appeared like it\nwas a pie cut in six or eight slices and each slice was a different\ncolor what i remember distinctly is each color was like a laser\ncolor vibrant orange vibrant pink very vibrant colors six or\neight colors on each one \u2013 and they were circulating not so\nfast as to blend the color but circulating they were beautiful they were about the size that the full moon appears so they are\nnot little lights full-moon size three and i am\nstanding there looking at these gorgeous beautiful vibrant-color\nthings spinning and colors and no sound and i was absolutely\nmesmerized i was just i was enthralled by seeing this gorgeous beautiful display and i looked at him and he is looking\nat me and he sa\u00a0 they are pretty are not they and i sa\u00a0 yes they are beautiful and\nthen he looks up and talks to them he sa\u00a0 they have told\nme to tell you that they are going now but they will see you\nlater and they did they started moving and they went out north afterwards we went back in and i sa\u00a0 what did i just\nsee tonight he sa\u00a0 that was us we have been\nhere for a long time you just did not know it he\nsa\u00a0  we picked you a long time ago when you were a small child we have something for you to do and i sa\u00a0 i am\nnot understanding exactly he sa\u00a0 you do not\nhave to we will let you know what it is you are supposed to do\nlater on in life but just go on with your life do not worry\nabout it whatever you are supposed to learn we will see to\nit that you learn and when it is time for you do what we have for\nyou to do you will know we will let you know after\nthat i would go over there on the weekends to visit him and the\nmother and the two girls and we would go out to the desert\nsometimes go way out in the desert the girls with their mother would go for a walk and he and i would walk in the desert and he\nwould tell me about all the different alien lifeforms that are out\nthere where they have come from the ones that are here and\nhe told \u00a0 you have enemies here you have some very powerful\nenemies here from other places that have come and they know who you\nare and they know what you are going to do so just be careful\nin your life but we will protect you i did not\nknow what he was talking about and then one day i went over\nto the house one morning and the house was totally open and they are\ngone everything was packed and gone and the girl never told\nme she was leaving they had never come to tell me anything they\nwere just gone now that i look back on that experience i\nfeel very secure in saying that he knew what he was doing he\nsa\u00a0 i am starting you on your journey and he did but\nafter that was done then he moves on do you believe\nthat you are at that place that juncture where he was talking\nabout you are going to know has another message come\nrecently or do you feel that you are right on the cusp of\nsomething i feel along the beginning of something and\ni am still not sure what all of this means i am not sure\nwhat it means all i know is that i have some valuable stuff that is\ngoing to really knock people out when they see it but i do not\nunderstand it fully yet i have talked with zecharia about it i have talked with many other speakers and people that are in the\nspeaking circuit that are knowledgeable on the subject but\nmy gut feeling and incidentally gut g-u-t is simply god\nin scandinavian god is english dog spelled backwards but\ngod in i think it is sweden and scandinavian countries is\nspelled g-u-t so when you say you have got a gut feeling that is god in scandinavian but my gut feeling is that\ni do not know the full picture yet but i am getting there\nnow after 48 years i now know that my 48 years of study day in and\nday out researching reading studying in libraries was for a\nreason so that when the time would come i would at least be\nsufficiently educated in this dark subject which i am talking\nabout at least i have got some background in it now to be able\nto understand the significance of it and i think it is\nreally frightening to me it actually is still rather frightening\nbecause being human and watching the world where it is\ngoing and i already know the symbols the words  the terms i\nalready know the history of the secret societies and the movements of\nthe bankers i\u2018ve sat and talked with all kinds of\npeople around the world with hakim my dear friend hakim the\nhammite priest in egypt  we have sat out by the pyramids at\nnight and talked about the ancient hammite priesthood and i was\nblessed in the pyramid hakim blessed me in the king\u2019s\nchamber i laid in the sarcophagus and he did a whole prayer ritual\nover me i have sat like i said for hours and talked with him\nin private about things that have happened to me so i am\ntotally convinced that there is nothing special about me but i\nhave been given the opportunity to be in the company of fascinating\npeople to learn monstrously fascinating things and ultimately i\nthink that there is something for me to do i am just not sure\nyet what it is do you happen to have an idea what race\nthis man was from do you have a planet do you have any idea in\nother words do you think he was anunnaki do you think he was\nnordic do you think he was pleiadian do you have any idea no not really because he appeared to be an extraordinarily\nordinary-looking guy just an ordinary guy you would meet but when i\nwas in his presence it was monstrous  the feeling i knew this is not a normal man did his children have a\ndifferent aura or a different feeling about them no no they seemed to be very ordinary and the mother but\ndid not you tell me just recently and correct me if i am\nwrong but i think you were out in the desert and you had something\nhappen out there oh yeah very recently oh yeah no no that is a different story well is it completely different is it possible that there was some\nkind of well no you are right you are\nright there could very well be some kind of a connection with what\nhappened to me just a few years ago and that original incident back\nin 1959 yes very possible that was another extraordinary\nexperience i have had 36 what i call peak experiences i\nmean monstrous experiences that was merely one but yes i have\nhad some very interesting and emotionally-drenching experiences out\non the deserts of nevada one thing i will tell you which is\njust my opinion i am totally convinced for myself that at area 51 that base we call area 51 there is no doubt in my mind that there\nare extraterrestrial life forms there no doubt in my mind about it\nat all because of what i have personally seen and experienced\nwhen i was at rachel\u2019s i have had too many strange things\nhappen to me that were other-worldly in-your-face like one-on-one and so there is no doubt in my mind that what i\nexperienced out there we had an alien come in the mobile home my\nfriend paul tice and my lady friend from hawaii ivy  all three\nof us an alien came in the bedroom so there is no doubt in my\nmind there is something really off the wall going on out there\nat area 51 that we are not aware of but i have had many\notherworld experiences out there not just you know i\ncannot stand it when people say that this is all high technology\nof our government no i do not buy that for a minute what i have\nseen with my own eyes i do not buy it for a minute if it has\nanything to do with our government then what i have actually\nwitnessed with my own eyes if it has to do with the u.s government then it means that the u.s government is in league with\nextraterrestrials because what i saw is extraterrestrial in origin and what i have experienced thank you for that that is\nvery very valuable to hear you say that can you talk about\nthe possibility of what these humans that are being created what\ntheir destiny might be in other words you say they might not have\nfeelings etcetera etcetera and do you feel that perhaps this is\nworking in with your sort of destiny that they were talking about because these subjects we are talking about right here\nand now i actually went to egypt with you and william henry and\nthat group i did have a short interview with you at that time you\nwere not willing to talk about that then i think that now\nyou are much more willing this message that you have seems to\nbe culminating in what you are saying in this symbol that we\ntalked about in the beginning of this interview is it possible that\nthis is going to be the message the unfolding of what you know my feeling is that the reason why i am here doing\nwhat i am doing is because of this mutation which is being\nfoisted on the human race it is being forced on\nthe human race this change that the masters of the universe so to\nspeak have in mind for the human race is being foisted on us and i believe \u2013 again just my opinion \u2013 that\nthat is my part in this cosmic scheme or this cosmic play is to\ncall people back to their humanity and let them know you are\nbeing led down the garden path into something you do not know\nwhat is coming you had better get back to your roots of being\nhuman and start reestablishing your humanity \u2013 because\nthe human race is losing its humanity the way we were\ndesigned by the original creators was a beautiful thing i mean when\nyou look at children and little animals you have to know that\nwhoever designed us designed humans and lifeforms to be beautiful to\nbe charming to be a beautiful thing to live in a beautiful world\nwith children and gorgeous and beautiful things which uplift the\nspirit but i am totally convinced that there is now on the\nearth again for lack of a better term alien presence which are\nthe enemies of the human race and they are obviously enemies of\nwhoever the original creators of us because of the things i have\nbeen told \u2013 that the people or the entities who created us the\ngods who created us have enemies out there in the universe they\nhave come here to see what these gods are doing what these aliens\nare doing and they are coming here saying mm i see what\nthey are doing they are creating these creatures why\ndo not we move in like a gang why do not\nwe move in and take over and take this beautiful creation that these\ngods have created and mutate it into what we want and so to\nmutate the whole human race away from their natural evolution of\nsociety and humanity into a whole new kind of civilization i\nthink that that is probably what i am here to do is to\ncall attention to the world that you are being misled by some\nextraordinarily powerful occult mystical other-world technology\nthat is changing the evolution of the human race from what it was\nsupposed to be in its creation as opposed to where the dark powers\nof the world are now leading the human race into a different world and what they have in mind for us you do not want to know okay the people who are in power today in\nthis country and around the world have something in mind that you\nhave no idea in the world how bad it is really going to be because there will be no longer any place for freedom intellectual\nfreedom spiritual freedom liberty justice \u2013 none of that it is gone okay but you are protected and\nyou have been told this over and over again and this person that\nyou met way back who sort of started you on your journey was also\npart of a race that has been visiting here and is looking out for\nyou in essence you have told at least me some personal stories\nin which you were protected \u2013 there was reasons you were told\nto leave a room at a certain opportune moment and so on and so\nforth that is right and i have had that happen to\nme over and over and over again right so that means\nthere is a force for good profoundly dangerous\nthings happening and at the moment i just did not know walked out\nand some terrible dangerous thing happened and i never even heard\nabout it so there seems to be a force for good some\n\u201cwhite hats behind the scenes yes some of whom have actually talked to you face to face protected\nyou one that passed on recently comes to mind right these people who might have been working behind the\nscenes even in places that you know made them appear to be working\nfor the dark side if you will yeah the establishment but in point of fact they were extremely powerful people and very\nhigh placed working for the light working\nfor the light and\nthey told \u00a0 we know what you are doing one\nof them told \u00a0 you have some very powerful friends that you\ndo not even know exist and they are protecting you i know i have had the i am not going to get\ninto the details but i have actually witnessed protection from the\nhighest sources in this country step into something that was very very serious happening in relation to me and i was really\nfrightened because i knew the implications of what is happening\nand they could be very serious for me i \u201cmay not be around\nmuch longer i have heard from the top and then\nall of a sudden i get a communication from washington d.c from the\nhighest office there saying do not worry about it we took\ncare of it just go on and do not worry about it and i was\namazed \u2013 from washington d.c somebody that high up calls me\nand says do not worry about it just go on about your life no one\u2019s going to bother you and they did not i have\nhad this happen many many times when something very serious very\nserious threats against my life and against my work i get a phone\ncall or someone will walk up to me in a public place and say jordan that thing that you have been worried about the last two weeks yeah we took care of it move on do not\nworry about it i thought well i mean i am\nstill here i am still alive so i know that i\nhave been protected i know that absolutely where would the truth movement be without you specifically zeitgeist is a movie that was in the top five most-viewed on\ngoogle video for like a year at least and i would like the project\ncamelot viewers to be apprised of the situation in regards to your\ninvolvement with zeitgeist because it seems like management as i call them put you in a position in which the whole conspiracy\ntheory movement would not be anywhere near what it is now if it\nwas not for your influence yes zeitgeist\nis a two-hour movie made by a guy named peter joseph in new york i\ndid not know anything about it but peter joseph produced a\ntwo-hour video and the last that we heard because on zeitgeist\nit was one of the first times google pulled the counter off of\nsomething that is on google video usually it would have a\ncounter how many people have seen this video they pulled the\ncounter they pulled it i think it was at 28 million when they\npulled it and that was like a year-and-a-half ago and\nthat is based all on your work is not it all\nof it was based on my work jeff rense had peter joseph and you\ncan go to my website www.jordanmaxwell.com and go to the audio/video page one of the first entries is a big\nbanner saying zeitgeist interview and it is only\nabout five minutes long but jeff rense interviewed peter\njoseph about zeitgeist and talked about how you know they\npulled the counter a year-and-a-half ago at 28 million and it is\nprobably more than 50 million now but he sa\u00a0 why did\nyou make this video and he  sa\u00a0 because\nthe whole thing was jordan maxwell\u2019s work i was listening to\nhim i have been following his work and i just decided since he\nhas not done anything i will so he put all of my\nwork together on religion ancient theology the federal reserve banking and 9/11 and all that nonsense and put it all together into\na two-hour video called zeitgeist which i am told by\npeople my friends in hollywood (and i have lived in\nhollywood for 48 years my friends have said that if they had 28\nmillion and they pulled it off a year ago probably seen by 50\nmillion \u2013 that is a very good showing in hollywood if\nyou can get 50 million people watching something that represents\nyou that is pretty heady stuff in hollywood absolutely i did not do it i did not even\nknow anything about it but since then there have been about six\nother professionally-presented videos done on me that i had no idea people would call and tell me there is an hour show on you\nin england there is an hour show on you in france germany actually came over  the national german network \ncame over and did an hour program on me and they had arnold\nschwarzenegger in it and the whole thing was in german kerry\nlaughs] i still have a copy of it they sent me it was done in german\non me i understand now i do not know if you are\nwilling to talk about this but zecharia sitchin and you sat down and\nyou asked him to tell you a secret based on all your time with him the things that you had done for him etcetera etcetera you\nbasically said tell me something that i do not know yeah are you willing to talk about that no because i think that that is a clue\nthat people would really benefit from knowing yeah i\ndo not think i want to talk about that okay because do you feel that zecharia would not like\nthat information out there no it was that it was a\nprivate conversation and when i asked him because like i said at\none time i was in business with zecharia i had a contract with him and so we were business partners and so i felt a little bit more of\na leeway to talk with zecharia in private so i asked him one time\nsome very personal questions about his work and it was absolutely\nmind-blowing and staggering the things he was telling me and\nthen well anyway then he told me some things about myself\nand i was amazed i never heard such a thing that what he was being\ntold or wherever he got it from he had a view on me who i\nam and what i am doing but at that time we were talking it was\na private conversation and i think it would be better just left\nprivate okay fine all i will say is\nthis zecharia sitchin is a fascinating man and a brilliant writer and i love everything he is doing and i love the man he is\na very dear friend and i love zecharia sitchin he is a very very gentleman kind of guy and so i like that okay would you classify what you have been talking about in a sense as a \u201cwar that is going on on a spiritual level yes no doubt about it for the hearts and\nminds of humanity yes absolutely there is a spiritual\nwar going on right now and hollywood\u2019s making movies about it \u2013\nwar of the worlds steven spielberg i have said so many\ntimes that steven spielberg and george lucas are many things but\nstupid is not one of them steven spielberg is\ntrying to tell you something in one of his interviews a few years\nback i remember he said that he does not steven spielberg said i\ndo not make movies to entertain necessarily i make movies to\ncomment on important issues of the day and looking at\nspielberg\u2019s work which is genius something i want to say\nabout spielberg i have watched a lot of productions and i have\nbeen in hollywood for a long time 48 years i have lived in north\nhollywood and hollywood and i have many many many friends in the\nindustry i already know because i have been told that\nvirtually all the major names in hollywood know who i am \u2013 and\nthey should \u2013 i have been talking for 48 years and they are using all my stuff now so they should know me but steven spielberg is one of the most clever people i have\never watched a person\u2019s work because he puts a couple of\nthings one is he is a stickler for accuracy on costumes and\nterms that are used so anytime you see anything that spielberg has\nmade it is very accurate \u2013 the clothing that would have\nbeen worn in those days the way the people would have talked it is\nvery accurately done so he is a stickler for accuracy but\nthe thing i really appreciate about steven spielberg is he puts\nlittle things little small things that you would never see if you are\nnot looking for it that are really a mind-blower a wow back\nthat up and that one scene with that one person what they said he is a master at doing that he is a master at putting\npowerful things in some little insignificant scene so if you are\nnot watching you will never get to see the real genius of steven\nspielberg i love watching his movies because i know what i am\nlooking for so he is using symbolism oh yeah all over his movies everywhere and george lucas equal george lucas is brilliant in my opinion he\nsaid he was heavily influenced by joseph campbell the famous yes and joseph campbell was an incredibly\ndear man i just loved listening to joseph campbell explain\nmythologies and all the symbols of the ancient people did you know him no i never had a chance to meet\njoseph campbell what about arthur c clarke did you\nmeet him no i never had a chance to meet arthur c clarke either but i would love to have i have had opportunities\nto be in the company of people like that but i was not in a position\nto travel i did not have the money i was in a depressed state\nof mind and so i let some very important people go by that i could\nhave been with i used to be on the board of directors of an\norganization in hollywood \u2013 this was quite a few years ago \u2013\ncalled usofa usofa was united sensitives of america this\norganization was founded in burbank and i came in at a very early\nperiod and i ended up being on the board of directors of usofa i\nreally did not take a whole lot of charge in it the man who\nstarted it pretty much ran it but in words i was on the board of\ndirectors but anyway it was an organization where\nnumerologists astrologers all kinds of esoteric disciplines would\ncome together and we would put on shows expos and also once a year\nwe would put on an award show where we would honor certain movie\nstars for their work feeding the poor or whatever but\nwere not you also involved in maybe discovering murder suspects oh yeah and also occult happenings that\nwere going on every two weeks i think it was like\nevery two weeks we would meet about 9:00 in the evening up in the\nhollywood hills from the hollywood sign we would be up there and\nthere had be about 50 people up there in this big huge home that\nwas owned by a movie star who had passed away it was a huge big\nhome and the front room was just enormous in size and there would be\nlike 50 people there every two weeks there would be a group of\nastrologers a group of psychics a group of numerologists this\ngroup and that group and they were all different disciplines in the\nesoteric sciences and we would have the police department or\nthe sheriff\u2019s department \u2013 usually it was lapd would come\nup sheriff a couple of times too \u2013 and they would come up we\nhad a big blackboard and they would have pictures up on the wall of\nthe case that they wanted us to talk about they would show us the\nperson who was kidnapped or the body that was found or whatever the\ncase was and then the officer in charge usually a detective would\nwrite down or have it already written down all the pertinent\ninformation that the police department had and each group sat with a\ngroup all the astrologers sat together i do want to\nask you which group were you among were you psychic no i was with the people who were putting it on it was all being\nsponsored by the usofa united sensitives of america and since i was\non the board i was there representing the company that is\nputting this thing together like i said we also would have\naward ceremonies once a year in which we would give awards to\ndifferent people who were doing different things for humanity i was\nprivileged to be able to be there to give manly palmer hall an award\nfor his work in service to the world manly palmer hall i\nbelieve was one of the finest and most dearest men i have ever met\nin my life he was not only charming an extraordinarily brilliant\nmind but he was one of the most decent and beautiful people that i\nhave ever personally have ever met manly palmer hall was\nan extraordinary teacher he never promoted anything he merely\neducated people as this is where this came from this is where\nthat came from this is what that word means so he was an\neducator people have called him all kinds of names because he was a\nmason i knew him personally i have been to his home when he\ndied he left me a beautiful gift \u2013 all of his research\njournals he left to me that is amazing i was shocked when i got a phone call from the philosophical\nresearch society in los angeles and obadiah harris the president at\nthat time said mr hall wanted you to have something when he\npassed away and i sa\u00a0 what is it i was in san\ndiego and he sa\u00a0 i am not going to tell you just\ncome pick it up so\ni drove up that day to los angeles from san diego and it was all of\nthe research journals of manly palmer hall he gave to me and i\nconsider that to be a monumental gift from a very powerful man did you find some clues there to follow out tons of stuff there okay manly palmer\nhall as i said was one of the greatest teachers the world has ever\nknown in my humble opinion i do not think there is ever\nbeen in any era of time a man to come close to what manly palmer hall\nwas able to do anyone who has an open mind \u2013 and of course your mind is like a parachute it does not work if it is\nnot open \u2013 anyone who is intellectually honest which you do not\nfind very much  intellectually honest with an open mind mature and\nintelligent person looking at the work of manly palmer hall would\nhave to say this is one of the greatest men that ever lived i\ndo not know how many maybe 70 or 80 books on esoteric\nsubjects of the whole world over 46 sets of lectures like six\n90-minute audio lectures of 46 esoteric subjects of the world wonderful incredible plus thousands of lectures incidentally i have everything he ever did every lecture he ever\ndid i have digitized monumental work but he was a personal friend\nof mine and i loved him dearly i am saying this because there\nare so many people who put him down because he was a mason he was a\nwonderful teacher a brilliant man to which his detractors could not\neven hold a candle i hear you and he is\nnot the only one i have other people i feel the same way about okay how do you feel just to change gears here a\nlittle bit about the current administration of obama well i am not political as such personally \u2013 i\nthink i ought to choose my words carefully here \u2013 because i\nlike obama as a person and he is very personable he is\nthe kind of guy i would love to sit and chat with his children are\nbeautiful his wife is a very intelligent lady and so i do not\nhave anything against obama or his family i think they are very\npersonable and very interesting people but it is the\npowers behind him that he represents that is frightening to\nme i know things about the people who are behind him that is\nabsolutely staggering frightening i live in fear of what is\ncoming because of what i know \u2013 not because of what i\nbelieve or think \u2013 because of what i know are you talking about war are you talking about an agenda that\ninvolves war world war three well that is always\npossible let me go back and say this again i have nothing against\nobama as a person and i like him the family nothing against them at\nall but the symbol that i was telling you about that i have\nbeen working on did you ever see the movie or the television show\nv oh absolutely the very first\none yes well abc is now remaking v they are remaking it and i was shocked \u2013 someone sent me\nan email i think they were in hollywood and they sent me an email\nwith a picture from the new movie coming out soon i think it is\ngoing to come out in the next month or so a made-for-television\nmovie by abc oh really okay fabulous disney abc very interesting okay okay yeah and it is going to be called v\nand it is a remake of the original okay but in it the extraterrestrials who are referred to as the\nvisitors the visitors in the new one are giving to the public a\npamphlet explaining their (quote new world order that\nthey are bringing to planet right and the\npicture which i have shocked me my knees got weak and i had to sit\ndown it was shocking it was the visitors the alien visitors who\nlooked like humans were handing out pamphlets to the people about\ntheir new order that they were going to bring in and the title\nof the pamphlet was the dawn of a new day  the very words\nthat i have been researching for some 40 years is now going to be in\nthe movie the new v okay and i am\ntelling you that is not only significant it is mind-blowing\nwhen i give you the whole story abc and disney are\ntelling you something about this symbol that i have been looking\nat for a long time and it is going to be right in your face because i am telling you that symbol is going to become the\nmost important symbol around the globe for the first time in the\npublic view anytime you want to do research on the hidden\nstuff like i have done it is everywhere but no now\nbecause of obama now the secret societies of the \u2013 what i\nthink are extraterrestrial masters of this world \u2013 are going to\nbring this symbol out into the world so everyone can see it and\neventually what is going to happen is that the whole human race\nis going to wake up and this is my opinion about 2012 \u2013 my\nopinion of 2012 is there is going to be an awakening for the\nwhole world we have been had they are going to see\nthis is an ancient thing that is been coming for a long time and\nwe never saw it we did not understand it but when my\nvideo comes out that i want to do \u2013 it is going to be like\na three-hour step-by-step on obama\u2019s symbol jimmy carter all\nthe presidents the bushes the entire superstructure of western\ncivilization and what this stuff really means and where it\nis really comes from i think and i am not\ntrying to aggrandize myself but i really believe that it is\ngoing to cause quite a sensation when people see what i really am that i have never told anyone before and when i see\nobama using the same terms the same symbol the same one that the\ncommunists used the nazis have used the fascists have used the\nsecret societies around the world of freemasonry have used the\nbabylonians as i said all the ancient egyptians \u2013 they all\nused the same word term and symbol and now abc is coming\nout disney abc is coming out with a new remake of v and in\nit the extraterrestrials that look like humans who are bringing a\n(quote new order to the world and the pamphlet in the\nmovie is called dawn of a new day i sa\u00a0 wow i\ncannot believe how overwhelmingly obvious this secret symbol is now\nbecoming and that is why i will do this video on it but were you told more about the movie more about where they are\ngoing with it in other words i am assuming you have not\nseen it yet no i have not seen it yet but i\nwatched the other one so many times and the \u201cother ones if you remember the original the visitors they were wonderful\npeople they were very gracious and charming and then remember the\nlady who was in charge of the visitors she was the highest ranking she went into a room and pulled off her face \u2013 it was a reptile\nalien yes i personally i brought\ndavid icke to america he was in america because i brought him here personally yes and so i am saying\nthat i am totally convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt for myself that there are such things as reptile aliens though i have never\nseen one thank god but i totally believe they are here not because\nof david icke not because of credo mutwa who i love listening to a\nwonderful fascinating man david icke has done great stuff but i\nbelieve there are reptile aliens here because of my own personal\nresearch i have been in the company of at least eight people\nover the past many years eight different people each one is\nextraordinarily well-grounded people airline pilot one with a\nmajor airline a very wealthy man in las vegas who buys and\nsells commercial hotels and buildings etcetera \u2013 extremely\nwealthy man \u2013 christian incidentally very christian man but\nvery very wealthy and very highly intelligent man sat down and told\nme about his personal one-on-one with a reptile alien in which many\nothers in his church were privy to see that is a whole story in\nitself that happened in colorado and then to have scientists and a young lady who was one of my favorite people in the\nworld a young lady called nancy who just blew me away on my radio\nshow \u2013 i used to have a show i have had seven different\nradio shows in my life i had like to get back on radio and do my\nown show again but i had a show on kpfk here in los angeles fm\nstation and one night i had nancy on and nancy just blew the\naudience away she is so feminine so incredibly charming and\nfeminine girl talking about stuff that will blow your mind her father was in the air force her family was\nair force but her father was in charge of project retrievables for\nthe air force \u2013 the man who was in charge of going out wherever\nin the world  any extraterrestrial activity he was in\ncharge in the air force to go there first and he was the boss and\nshe said the modus operandi was always the same i will\nhave to make you a copy of her two i have got two two-hour\ninterviews that will just knock you out i had love\nto hear you could tell this is a very charming girl but telling you stuff that you are going to have to sit down to\ndeal with she said wherever they would go she\nalways lived on military bases and she said always the method was\nthe same there was one phone in the house for the family and then\nthere was another phone which no one ever touched you never used\nit when that phone would ring no matter when  two in the\nmorning three in the morning  it does not matter if that\nphone rang her father had ten minutes to be fully dressed with his\nbriefcase and ready to go in ten minutes a car would pull up and\nnothing was said  no voices nothing was said a knock on the door he would walk out he would have military escort into the car get in\nthe car and drive off and nothing said nobody knows where he is\ngone and nobody needs to know and so she said that many a\nnight they would get that phone ring he would get up dress briefcase ready to go and they would take him somewhere in the world\nwhere something has just happened and the air force was sending him\nto see what just happened and they are in charge and\nshe would tell me the things that her father and especially her\nmother she said the father would never tell her anything when she\nwas a child but the mother would tell her later on in life she\ntold me an experience that just blew my mind about a reptile alien you really have to hear it from her but basically the story is so\nfascinating  i\u2018ve got to tell you it she sa\u00a0\nher father would never allow her to be left alone in the house ever when he would go off during the day they live on base it\ndoes not matter when he would leave the house immediately\nmilitary would come and guard all four corners of the property they\nwould sit there in cars and guard while he is gone anywhere if\nhe went to the market or whatever they would be guarding the house and he would never allow her to stay at home by herself and\nso she said one night \u2013 you will hear this interview \u2013\nshe said one night it was not on base they were here in los\nangeles somewhere and she said that her mom and dad were\ngoing next door to a party next door and she asked her dad if she\ncould stay she was like thirteen fourteen years old and he\nsa\u00a0 no absolutely not so she talked to her mother\nand the mother talked to the father and got him to agree that she\ncould stay home and she sa\u00a0 so for the first time in\nher life she was actually going to be alone in the house by herself so she sa\u00a0 she was in a bedroom combing her hair\nand she had a mirror that she could see her closet and the closet had\nfrench doors she sa\u00a0 they were closed partially\nclosed and it was not too well lit in the room she\nsa\u00a0 she was combing her hair looking at the closet door and\nall of a sudden the closet door opened up and a reptile alien\nstepped out she sa\u00a0 he had to bend down to get\nunder the header and he stood up she sa\u00a0 it was a\nfull-grown man extremely muscular but it was a reptile body reptile alien head and she sa\u00a0 this thing looked\nat me and i am looking at it in the mirror and she\nsa\u00a0 he started moving toward me without moving his legs \u2013\nhe was just floating toward her slowly and she sa\u00a0 i\nfelt like it was like coming up on a fly you know grab it quick she sa\u00a0 she jumped up and screamed and ran down the\nhallway ran into the bathroom locked the door opened the window\nand started screaming of course everybody in the\nneighborhood heard and she sa\u00a0 this reptile alien came\ndown the hallway and she sa\u00a0 i could feel him\nwalking because he was so heavy and he was scraping on the door growling like a dinosaur growl scraping on the door she said that when her father and the neighbors come running up they\nopened the door when they came running up they were yelling\noutside this reptile alien ran back down the hallway into her\nbedroom and disappeared she sa\u00a0 when her father\ncame in the bathroom door was just ripped and obviously the father\nsaid he was not going to hurt her but it was a message and\nhe sa\u00a0 that is why i never wanted her to stay alone because these aliens have told us the air force that \u201cyou\nkeep poking your nose into our business every time something happens\nyou come out and poke your nose so we just want you to know the\nnext time something happens and you poke your nose into our business while you are out here poking your nose in our business some of\nus are going to come visit your daughter so you need to stay home\nand stay out of our business so he said that is\nwhy they always had military around any time he left and so\nwhen she was telling me this story about other reptile aliens and\nof course i have heard it from so many legitimately-important\npeople i have to believe that there is something to this story i\nhave personally not seen one but i do not want to kerry\nlaughs] but i have seen enough to know that there are\nlife forms on this earth which are not from here i have already\nseen too much to know that my experiences have been extraordinary as i said 36 major experiences i have had in my life where i have\ndealt with other-world phenomena okay well this is a\nreally amazing interview can you talk at all about anything else\nthat you think that people should know in terms of the overall\npicture that you have been giving them here i would\ns\u00a0 be aware that there is a war for your soul there\nis a war for the spiritual you know there is always been this\nquestion for thousand of years all the great philosophers ask it about whether we are physical bodies which have a spirit in it or\nare we originally a spirit which has taken on a physical body you\nknow which comes first the chicken or the egg but i am\nconvinced that no matter how it happens  if we were physical and\ntook on a spirit or maybe we were spirit and took on a physical\nbody i believe that there is a war going on from somebody out there\nthat was an original enemy of whoever created us so whoever created\nus has enemies out there in the universe and that are diabolical\nenemies and we know this is true in government you know you may see the president and the first lady and all of that it is\nvery prominent and proper but they have enemies powerful enemies that is why they have to be totally surrounded by military and\nprotection because they have serious enemies something happened to\nme that tells me that there is something going on like that i\nwas in hawaii many years ago my wife and some friends we went to\nhawaii for the first time i was sitting in a restaurant across the\nstreet from the hilton village in the restaurant \u2013\nwhich is a main drag a main strip \u2013 i was sitting with my back\nto the door someone came in and i immediately had an electrical\ncharge go through my body it is bad enough being shocked by a\nwall plug but if you do not know it is coming it is\neven worse i was sitting at the table talking and all of a\nsudden somebody came in and an electrical shock went through me and\ni knocked stuff on the table i knocked water and stuff on the table\nand i jumped up involuntarily i just jumped up and\nsomethinig told \u00a0 run quick you are in trouble you are\ngoing to die run quick i ran out the back door\nof the restaurant ran across the restaurant  left my wife and my\nfriends  ran across the restaurant ran out the back door and\nthe voice sa\u00a0 run quick you are in trouble go across the\nstreet to the hotel and i screamed i remember yelli\u00a0\ni cannot go across the street there is traffic out\nthere and it sa\u00a0 run there will be no traffic run and so i ran out into the street involuntarily i\nwas not making a conscious decision to do any of this it was being\nfoisted on me i ran across the street and as it so happened there\nwas no traffic for that little stretch i ran out and it\nsa\u00a0 go out around the hotel the voice was sayi\u00a0\nrun quick to the hotel and i ran around the hotel and\nit sa\u00a0 all right you are safe now now you are safe and i sat down my heart was pounding and i kept thinki\u00a0\nwhat did i just do and how am i going to explain this to my wife\nand my friends what i just did involuntarily i do not know\nwhat happened that happened to me twice the\nsecond time was a few months later in los angeles i was on the\ncorner of fairfax and wilshire boulevard in a little coffee shop\ncalled johnnie\u2019s hamburger stand it is a little\nrestaurant i was sitting at the counter and i noticed \u2013\nperipheral vision i did not look over to see them but\nperipheral vision  i saw two guys walk in and as they walked in immediately an electrical shock hit me i almost fell off i was at\nthe counter and the voice sa\u00a0 get out quick you are\nin trouble run and i so i grabbed a bunch of money threw it on the counter and tripped trying to get out of the chair on\nthe counter i got up and i hit the side door and i ran north on\nfairfax and the voice kept sayi\u00a0 run your life is in\ndanger run quick i ran about two or three blocks until\ni was just about out of breath and then the voice sa\u00a0 all\nright you are safe now you are safe now sit down and i sat down my heart was pounding again and it was\ninvoluntary i did not make a conscious choice to run i just\nstarted running and the voice was talking it was yelling to me it\nwas actually like a yell move quick your life is in danger so that happened twice to me i have no idea what that all\nmeans i am just telling you what happened okay so you are positing the fact that there is this symbol that in the\nsymbol is basically telling the world of a new world order and the\nreturn or basically a son  taking control and that\nthis is happening sometime in the near future yeah and i am assuming you think around 2012 is that\ncorrect yeah that is what i think okay and then you are talking also about really reptilians\nand an agenda which is not quite clear but there is something going\non with that that is right so what\ni am now asking you is whether or not that so-called king is\nreptilian well i do not know and what i would say\nto an audience that is watching this i have said it too\nmany times before but i think it bears saying again i am not\nthe world\u2019s foremost authority on anything i am just\ntelling you what i have seen with my own eyes what has happened to\nme in my life but i would also say to anyone who would scoff\nat this just look at what i have to offer first before you make a\ndecision if i am crazy or not see what i have amassed in the\npast 40 years that i have not told you that you do not\nknow that i have and see the research that i have done on this\nsubject of this new order of the world which i started talking about\nback in 1960 i was sending letters to belmont massachusetts\nback in 1960 belmont massachusetts i was sending letters to the\njohn birch society who had just been formed in 1959 the john birch\nsociety was of course exposing all the communist activity in the\nworld especially in america i was already well into all of\nthat in \u201959 when they started and so i started sending them\narticles things like well you need to look at this symbol and\nthis word and this term here and also you might want to look at this\nguy and this organization so i was sending them little tidbits\nof information back in 1960 on the subject of illuminati on secret\nsocieties not illuminati because the illuminati i found\nout about like i said in 1967 when anthony hilder produced the\nseries of records of three 33-1/3 record albums called illuminati the man speaking was an incredibly interesting man named myron fagan\nand i do not know if you have ever heard myron fagan the\nilluminati record it will knock you out absolutely today it is\nstill a knockout when i hear it today \u00a0 wow i heard it 40 years ago when i hear it today it is still a\nmind-blower i have a question for you that is a little\nbit moving on to another topic it has to do with the illuminati but\ni wonder if you would address it what is the significance of merging\nthe red and the black oh that is interesting it is called \u2013 red and black and white all three red black and white \u2013 are referred to in hollywood as death\u2019s\nhead colors because death\u2019s head comes from a nazi\norganization called the ss the gestapo gestapo was referred to as\nthe order of the death\u2019s head and the order of the\ndeath\u2019s head gestapo of nazi germany symbol was the skull\nand crossbones \u2013 skull and bones that was their symbol but to the germans on the inside the gestapo was called the\norder of death\u2019s head and death\u2019s head\u2019s\ncolors in hollywood i attended a lecture many years\nago by a black doctor who worked at martin luther king hospital and\nsome of my friends in the motion picture industry black\nentertainers called me and said you really need to be here\ntonight you need to come and hear this it is going to be a\nprivate lecture by a doctor from chicago who came out here it\nwas an actual doctor working at martin luther king hospital and he\nwas giving a lecture on death\u2019s head colors it\nwas fascinating it was a slide presentation at a library in santa\nmonica library in a private invitation only there was only about 25\nto 30 people there and he was explaining the death\u2019s head\ncolors why it is black white and red and how black white and red are used in motion pictures when someone is going to die or\nsomeone\u2019s going to be killed those are the three prominent\ncolors that will always be in those scenes they are called\ndeath\u2019s head colors they symbolize the darkness of the\ndarkest the most profound presence of evil \u2013 red white and\nblack but there is also a significance in terms of\nthe occult with regard to certain genetics certain\ngenetics oh of course in other words the red being a\nred-headed person with certain kinds of dna oh i am\nsure there is more to that and the black being a\nblond usually celtic a mixture perhaps i am sure\nthat there is that too yeah the only thing i was saying was that\nwas very interesting because i remember that night he talked about\nthe european masonic orders and how the mexican gangs in los angeles\nand around the country use masonic symbols from a particular masonic\norder in europe while the black gangs use opposing symbols and terms\nof a different masonic order in europe and that most likely the gang\nmembers themselves do not realize that these actually can be traced\nback to masonic symbols in europe so i believe that the\ngangs going on in america today are being organized directed and\nfinanced out of europe to destroy our culture in america i think\nthat european freemasonry is heavily involved in destroying america and you need to understand the whole story about how america was\nfounded and how it was founded as a corporation it is a\nprivately-owned corporation we can talk about that for days on end this is just my opinion one man\u2019s opinion but i am\ngoing to give you my opinion as to the bottom line on the world today\nand the stuff that is going on on the earth today what\nwe call illuminati was originally a term which was given to in spain to a religious order in spain that later on were\namalgamated into what we call jesuits so the jesuits are\ntruly illuminati themselves and the vatican and you go\ninto that as well that was what i was going to say yes i believe that one of the most evil organizations that exists on\nthe earth today \u2013 and you had have to have spent all the\nyears with me in libraries and research societies and travel and go\naround the world and talking to other writers authors lecturers and teachers and collecting this stuff over a period of 45 to 48\nyears \u2013 to understand what i am telling you but i believe\ntoday the most serious evil organization on the face of the earth is\nthe vatican that is my personal opinion i think if the\nvatican was done away with off the face of the earth there would be\na shot of liberation heard round the world because the vatican in\nmy opinion is the bulwark of this dark thing that is happening\non the earth so when you talk about illuminati when you\ntalk about the really dark criminal stuff that is going on on\nthe earth you are talking the vatican you are\ntalking the knights of malta which gave us the six men who\nfounded the cia in america were all catholics members of the knights\nof malta when you begin to look at the banking fraternities\nin america like the bank of america union bank in california all\nof these people who founded these banks and today are running the\nbanking establishment are all knights of malta \u2013 catholic\nmasonry so when i hear people talking about the jews this the jews that and the jews are responsible i say no no you\nbetter go back and do your homework the jews have been\nslaughtered all over europe by the vatican you need to\nremember that for at least 2,300 years rome has dominated europe under the caesars of rome then in the late 4th century the vatican\ncomes into being and the vatican dominates all of europe all\nthe heads of state all the princes and kings and rulers all the\nkings and rulers in europe ruled by the divine right it is\ncalled the divine right of kings what are you talking\nabout who represents divine to give the king the right the pope the pope appoints certain families to be over the\nfrench the pope appoints certain people to be over the germans and\nover the british \u2013 and by divine right why because the\npope represents god and the pope says that this family is holy and\nthat they should rule and therefore they will say they rule by\ndivine right the whole idea of divine goes\nback to the chalice you know the holy grail and in the catholic\nmass you have the priest breaking the bread and then pouring the\nwine well wine is made from grapes and wine is red so it is a\nred grape wine it represents the blood of the atonement blood it is a blood sacrifice where does the wine come from it comes from grapes and grapes grow on the vine and\nthat is where we get the concept and the word divine\nbecause grapes come from the vine so that is where we get the\nword divine and once you begin to realize how the\nvatican has for over 2,300 years rome has dominated europe and\nin 1,600 years the vatican has dominated europe \u2013 and europe for 2,300 years has dominated the earth so if you want to\ntalk about conspiracies and you want to talk about evil do not\ntalk about jews you better talk about the people who control europe\nfor over 2,300 years \u2013 caesar of rome the roman catholic\nestablishment there is the real story now you are\ngetting into mafiosi now you are getting into the fraternal\norders of freemasonry out of europe knights of malta now\nyou are getting into the organized crimes \u2013 sicily corsica \u2013 and all of the profound drug-running white slavery murder for hire vatican i mean even what was his name the producer of godfather what was his name francis ford\ncoppola in godfather iii francis ford coppola in godfather\niii the third one in the series opens up with michael corleone\nbeing anointed by the cardinal in new york to be a member of the\nknights of malta in the catholic church in new york what\nis he telling you the connection between the vatican the holy\nfather \u2013 there is nothing holy about the \u201choly\nfather there is nothing holy in israel nothing there is\nnothing holy in the vatican there is nothing holy in salt lake city there is nothing holy in religion period it is a\nway that the masters whoever these entities are who are controlling\nthe human race they have set up certain institutions of learning of\neducation religion and government that is why i have said\nyou better go back and do your homework on where the history of the\nworld comes from i do not see the world being run by\njews i see jews being used but you will find that even\nrothschild the rothschild family who we hear so much about those\njews who were running europe no if you go back and look at the\nhistory of the rothschilds you will find that rothschilds\nrepresented the vatican he was dealing for the vatican he\nwas a vatican banker appointed by the vatican to deal for them so\nthat the catholic church would never be involved in all that terrible\nstuff going on in banking we will let the jew do it then of course if something comes out well it was jewish obviously no no it is your money that he was handling so\nif you really want to nail down the real enemy to america and then to\nthe earth i am telling you it is only taken me 48 years to\nget here i was born and raised catholic i mean my whole family\nwere very catholic we were the most catholic family in town but i\nknow history and i know that the most criminal organization on the\nface of the earth in my humble opinion \u2013 i do not know\nthat much about it i have just been looking here for 48 years \u2013\nis the vatican i hear you as far as i am\nconcerned it is the worst thing that is ever happened to\nthe world is what is really going on in the vatican and that\ndoes not even bring up the subject of propaganda due p2\n\u2013 propaganda due p2 lodge that was even mentioned in\ngodfather iii twice there is a masonic order in\neurope called propaganda due it is called p2 and p2 is\nconnected directly through membership with opus dei and the\nknights of malta and the jesuits jesuits opus dei knights of malta masonic order are connected directly to\nsomething called propaganda due p2 lodge of freemasonry p2\nlodge of freemasonry is world famous to people who do research into\ncriminal organizations p2 is pure unadulterated pouring directly\nout of the trough of nazism underworld organizations drugs human\ntrafficking pornography violence underworld organizations \u2013\nit is all p2 they are the ones who are promoting the\nright-wing death squads in central and south america mexico the\ndrug cartels in colombia we are talking catholic\nknights of malta drug cartels colombia \u2013 extraordinary vice\non a level which it is hard for most humans to recognize and it is\nall being orchestrated out of the holy father in rome this\nis why i have said so many times there is never gonna be a\ntime in the history of this country that america will be saved i\ndo not believe america can be saved i truly do not believe that\namerica \u2013 or the human race \u2013 i do not think it is just my opinion again but i do not think\nthe human race can be saved and i do not think america can be\nsaved because so many millions of people just love the filth and\ndegeneracy of the world we live in they love it they love the holy\nfather and all the pomp and glory of all the politicians and kings\nand rulers and the pusillanimous pictures of bush kissing the ring of\nthe holy father what does that look like for nancy pelosi speaker of the house nancy pelosi in full color on the news bowing\ndown and curtsying and bowing down and kissing the ring of a roman\npontiff the men who founded our great nation would throw up\nwith this treason high crimes and treason against the state by these\npeople who call themselves america\u2019s leaders i am telling\nyou the vatican has given us the mafia drug-running prostitution terrorism violence child pornography child pornography all of it and the children that are\ndisappearing are you familiar with leo zagami say it\nagain leo zagami oh yes yeah i have\nheard him many times okay he is gone back into\nthe fold because they tortured him yeah but when he was out for a moment talking to us he talked about\nunderneath the vatican is a huge reptilian base i do not\nknow i was not there but it would not surprise me right i do not know so there is some kind of linkup between the agenda of the\nilluminati the vatican who is heading all of that up and this\nreptilian roll-out \u2013 to get back to where we were talking about\nand perhaps this so-called figure who is taking the throne and\nthe symbolism that you are talking about i do not\nknow but it would not surprise me it would not shock me i want to say something about dan brown\u2019s movies okay angels and demons and the other one davinci code davinci code and now this\nnew one is it really called the what we were i think it is called the hidden symbol or\nthe secret symbol or something like that which my producer\nfriend and i were going to do a movie and we were going to call it\nthe hidden secret or the secret symbol i\nunderstand and now dan brown comes out the secret as far as i am concerned i have no respect whatsoever for dan\nbrown none i have no respect for the man at all because as far as\ni am concerned he is plagiarized and stolen and i do not\nlike people who steal because i have had it happen to me he stole from holy blood holy grail is not that right oh you can bet on it absolutely he stole the whole\nthing that whole story dan brown and the davinci code and\nall this other angels and demons all of that he stole now let me tell you what i think this is just my opinion i\nthink dan brown is a plant i think he is nothing more than a\npaid lackey and a plant i am totally sure that the real illuminati whoever these guys are at the top of the world use people like dan\nbrown who do not mind making a lot of money to become a whore i think that is all he is in my humble opinion i think dan\nbrown is just a whore he is just taking the money and sleeping\nwith the enemy i think what he is doing is he is\nnothing more than presenting what his masters behind the scenes want\nthe public and so they will spend all kinds of money telling you\nabout how wonderful dan brown is and oh my god he is so\nbrilliant and intelligent and all this silly nonsense and the\npeople who are so used to sucking up to hollywood will believe that\nstuff me i have been around hollywood 48 years i know\nthis stuff backwards and forwards i think dan brown is nothing more\nthan a front for a very powerful masonic order in europe which is\ntrying to lay the foundations for this novus ordo seclorum dawn of a new day sunrise-thing that is coming i think\ndan brown is nothing more than a whore taking the money and making it\nlook like he is the one that came up with this when in point of\nfact no it was stolen it was stolen from three men in england baigent leigh and lincoln right back in\n1980 there was a book put out that became a new york best-seller for\nmany many months it was a top-of-the-line best-seller called holy\nblood holy grail and the three authors were three british\nauthors baigent leigh and lincoln they outlined for the\nfirst time the story of the knights templar masonic order in\neurope the knights of the holy grail the whole concept of a masonic\nsecret society operating in the world and i would not be a bit\nsurprised if they were not better informed about this than what\nthey let us know i do not think they just by chance happened\nupon it i think they already knew something and they were putting it\nout in a book in such a way as to start people thinking about it but nonetheless baigent leigh and lincoln were\nextraordinarily brilliant writers and their research was impeccable i mean these guys nailed it down and even today around the world people who are knowledgeable on these subjects will agree baigent leigh and lincoln did one hell of a job they had their homework\ndone okay well i have one last question this\nbeen an amazing journey to take with you and i hope that we can go\ndown that road a little further in the future i think that people\nthat are watching this really need to get up to speed with you know following your other work your previous work hopefully attending\nany conferences you are speaking at i believe that you are\ncoming forward you had no preparation whatsoever and you spoke at\nour awake and aware camelot conference here in los angeles\njust last weekend and it is really an honor to be here with\nyou but i want to ask you if you think that this illuminati\nand what is going on in the united states right now do you\nreally think that they are going to be successful in taking down this\ncountry because it is clear that there is someone protecting\nyou there is a group protecting you you certainly have some amazing\npowers as you have demonstrated do you think that these powers these illuminati people behind the scenes are going to be successful\nat taking down the united states government yes i\ntotally agree yes that is what i think okay i\nmean you do have people behind the scenes that are protecting you you have demonstrated that time and time again on this video right they are therefore in theory protecting us here project camelot and other of our witnesses and\nso on because we are all talking about the same thing from different\nangles and getting our research together and so on that is right but in essence what i am\nwondering there are white hats operating as you know and as we\nknow because we have been interacting with those people from time to\ntime do you think it is possible that these people can be\nstopped no you do not no i do not okay i categorically say no i do not believe there is any reasonable evidence of anything of hope\nfor america or for the world that is my personal opinion i\nthink that the light at the end of the tunnel is a train coming there is no doubt in my mind for myself i do not\nbelieve america or the world at large is going to be able to\nextricate itself out of this situation no i do not believe it is\npossible and the reason why is because the people are too\nstupid they are too ill-informed ignorant ill-informed un-read self-centered egotistical materialistic and down-right\nstupid and they do not care basically speaking people do not\ncare ludwig von mises in one of these books the great\neuropean economist ludwig von mises said  and he is right-on\nas far as i am concerned  he said that in every age and in\nevery country the people of every nation have always supported a\ndictator the people have always supported a dictator and they\nalways will there is never been a time in the history\nof the human race that you can show me where the people of a nation\nrose up and demanded their freedom liberty and justice for all not\neven in america ninety-seven percent of the male population in\namerica at the time of the american revolution did nothing only 3 percent took up arms against the british masters and gave us a\nmodicum of freedom but happily that will never happen again america\nis finished this father of the girlfriend that you had when he spoke to you did he tell you that we are doomed i\nmean why did he call in the ufos and tell you all these things if we\nwere just going down the toilet did he tell you that we were doomed did he tell you there was a war and that we were going to lose no\nmatter what no okay let me rephrase\nthis do you realize that your mission and your call to arms which\nyou are really coming right on the verge here \u2013 i mean i\nthink that the new release of v is sort of a signal to the\npopulace a last-ditch attempt to wake the people up as to what may\nbe coming \u2013 and basically you have a mission we have a\nmission i am sorry you know jordan maxwell you are\na brilliant man but you were put here for a reason you have\nincredible force behind you the man who spoke to you all those years\nago and told you that you would have a journey is certainly behind\nyou now i would say that judging from everything that is gone\non with project camelot that we have some of the same force behind\nus and i have to say that the fact that you are sitting\nhere today and you are talking to us and you are alive\nand well and you are coming forward at this moment and talking\nabout things with really no holds barred is indication to me that\nthere is something going on that is more than you have dreamed\nof in your philosophy so i want to thank you very much well i want to answer that question i do not believe america can be\nsaved i hear you i do not believe the\nhuman race can be extricated or saved from what is coming i do not\nbelieve that my mission here is to save anybody i believe what i am\ndoing is to help those who want to know those handful of people who\nare awakening and who sincerely spiritually understand the dynamics\nof what is going on and who want to know and want to change and\nwant the protection of the spirit that is a small modicum of\npeople a very small niche i do not believe america can be\nsaved i am doing what i am doing only to help those who\nwant to know obviously you are a person who is trying\nto wake up people okay sometimes there has to be a severe word told\nto the people in order to actually get them to awaken and i do\nbelieve that this is part of your mission but i will thank you from\nproject camelot i hope that you are wrong about your final judgment\non the human race i do too and i am\nsure you do too absolutely that is why i am\ntrying to do whatever i can to help those who want to know and\nhopefully it may spread thank you thank you bill ryan (br one of the things that motivated dr pete\npeterson to come forward was his own increasing distaste at the\nprojects which he had been involved in and one of the many things we\ntalked to him about was what is known colloquially as the \u201csuper\nsoldier program and to refer to a human being\nas this sort of asset this disposable\nasset\nin the super soldier program tells you a little bit about how the\npowers that be regard the human life and the human spirit duncan\nwill tell you a little bit about this himself in the hour that he has\navailable duncan is the first generation of this particular\nprogram off-record we talked to dr pete peterson and i have\ngot to be a little careful about this but he talked about duncan\no\u2019finioan being the first generation of this program when\nwe say the\nfirst generation we are not talking about fathers and sons we are talking\nabout leaps in technology like the first generation aircraft\nwas the wright brothers the second generation aircraft was a second\nworld war early fighter jet the third generation aircraft is the b-2\nbomber the fourth generation aircraft are the things that officially\ndo not exist and which fly off in the secret space program the\nsuper soldier program is now in its fourth generation and we were\ntold some details about this kerry cassidy (kc at least and i am still trying i am still trying to\nthink at least i am just\nreporting you are saying \u201cat least that may be true no it is just that we do not\nknow what generation for sure because we do not know you know they have not let on i am just reporting\nwhat dr pete peterson told us project talent but go\nahead yeah so what you are going to\nhear just now is the personal story of somebody who is well-described\nas a real-life jason bourne he is trying to discover his\nidentity he is trying to figure out who did this to him and\nwhy and what happened and what memories he still has to recover in\nthe process there are still blanks we are very privileged\nto count him as a personal friend he is a man with a heart the\nsize of a planet we love him to pieces and the best story here is\ntold from him in person this is the important part of conferences\nlike this when you are looking at a little video which is two\ninches by three inches on a computer screen or reading a transcript it is not the same as hearing the words spoken from the heart of\na man who has been so deeply affected by these programs duncan\no\u2019finioan please come to the stage applause ovation]  okay i want to say a couple of words before we\nget started duncan is a highly gifted psychic among other things and i do want to say that when bill was talking about first\ngeneration and so on actually what we are talking about the logical progression of that becomes robots \u2013 okay becomes things like the\nterminator becomes things like human beings that are combined with machines who\nhave limbs that have been enhanced i am sure that\nduncan can clarify this for you but that is where we are\ngoing with this so i just wanted to be a little more specific not\nquite so general so that you understood where we are going with\nthis and there is no superficial relationship between some of the\nthings that pete peterson was involved in and we are not allowed to\ntalk about and what those other levels of what duncan was the first if you will the test case or the main test case prototype however\nyou want to put it the human prototype for okay so with\nthose leading comments you can take that where you will \u2013\nduncan o\u2019finioan duncan\no\u2019finioan (do\u2019f thank you well i did not expect\nthis i thank everybody for showing up this morning especially bill and kerry and project camelot for letting me do this i have no clue before i talk what i am going to say i\njust walk up and let it come out i will start with as bill was\nalluding to generations of this project is correct this is basically the fourth generation that we are in now i\nwas first generation 1960s there was a previous generation in the\n1950\u2019s that was a failed experiment so basically in my\ngeneration they started the program all from new all from scratch\nand we are right now if my information is correct in the\nfourth generation what i had like to do tonight or this\nmorning hey i am still on east coast time i\ndo not know what time it is i want to try something different i am going to try to stay away for the first twenty minutes or\nso from any scientific standpoint what i had like\neveryone to do is take a couple of deep breaths exhale it slowly relax yourselves yeah i am going to try a little experiment of\nmy own and see how it goes we are going to tell a\nlittle story the story starts in the winter of 1966 and if anybody\nknows what eastern kentucky looked like in 1966 well you are\nbetter than i am because i do not remember you are\ntalking two-lane roads mostly gravel eastern kentucky in the 1960\u2019s\nlooked like a throwback to the 1920\u2019s and that is where\ni am from well one winter afternoon i am loaded\nup in a truck by my parents and i am taken to a hardware store it is the only hardware store in the entire county and in the\nback of that store is a room that has a hidden door i had walked by\nthat wall with the door numerous times with my dad and my granddad did not know it was there so i was taken in by my mom and\nwe went through the door and in this room was about eight to twelve\nother kids about my age i was six years old and they are all\nsitting at these little low kindergarten-type tables and they all\nhave puzzles and they are trying to put the puzzles together now walking around the room is a lady of european descent with an extremely-heavy accent she comes over to me and helps me\ntake my jacket off and sets me down and asks me if i had like to\nplay i am six years old  of course i want to play she gives\nme some puzzle pieces and says make\na picture out of the pieces well for years since i have started regaining all my\nmemories we had thought that the test itself was making the correct\npicture with the puzzle pieces we do not believe that is\nso now what we think it was now was the lady\u2019s name was\nhelga she was a transmitter audience member (am can you\ntalk just a little bit louder for us audience member continues but\nthe words are unintelligible then audience laughs] \nokay she is a good friend of mine i am going to allow it what we believe now is that helga was a sender a\ntransmitter a psychic transmitter and the test was to see if i\nwould be a strong enough receiver because as the project\ntransgressed through the years we were mated up with another one\nbeing the transmitter one being the receiver one being the spotter one being the shooter and that is how we wound up being two-\nand three-person teams sometimes five okay but we were always\ntogether psychic to soldier now i am just going to\njump around a little bit because i have got an hour and i am\ngoing to assume most of you have seen the interview at one time or\nanother okay project talent \u2013 the easiest way to\nexplain what project talent was is basically or was\nbasically the taking of other peoples talents and using it\nfor their own purposes each one of us taken into this project had a\nspecific talent which the government took trained increased enhanced and exploited we were never supposed to regain our\nmemories but most some of us have in 1966 in the group\nthat i was in there was 1,000 of us there\u2019re less than 20\ntoday half did not survive now the process well first of all how many knows what multiple personality disorder\nis yeah that is about what i expected what they did\nwith us is they split our personalities this was artificially\ninduced and if you go look at one of the paintings on the back wall\nwhen you have a chance you will see a graphic description of\nwhat was done the alternate personality is the one that was\ntrained in every martial art known to humankind we were trained to\nfly every aircraft there was at that time we were trained in every\naspect that you could think of every art of war every part of the\nmilitary there was we were in essence a par\nelite\nof soldiers and we were used all around the world a lot of our\nassignments were for termination a good deal was for\nintelligence-gathering but by and large we were assassins pure and\nsimple and someone needs to be held responsible for this so\nwhere do we start who do we hold responsible now i am 50 years\nold the people who did this to us in my generation are probably long\ngone however the projects continue under different names different\nguises they still continue so how do we stop it anybody how do we\nstop it by people like you talking i am just a loudmouth on a stage that is one how about we turn ourselves\nagainst them we were created to be a private army in the future people ask me if\nyou are exposing this you went through all this why are you\nstill alive i am still alive for two reasons i was part of a project the\nproject has not ended it is still ongoing the reason\nmost of us are still alive is they hope to activate us one last time\nand be the protectors the private army of the elite of this country i am not going to do it and i do not know any of us\nthat will now what i am\ngoing to do with the rest of my time is kind of turn this over to the\naudience you know i do not have a whole lot new to talk about i have pretty much done that there is a lot of new things\nthat is still in the hypothesis stage i never say anything as fact\nunless i have three points of reference and proof to back it up so what i had like to do is turn this over to kind of a\nquasi q&a if you do not mind so if anybody has anything\nthat they would like me to add on to or to explain more let us\ndo that for awhile yeah she had her hand up before you pc assista  why do not we have\npeople queue up over here to save time that is\nfine cool okay am 1 i know with your multiple personality\nthey have a way of triggering you you know changing you  have you\nfound with any of the other people or with yourself any way to be\nable to stop that whether it be like i know that we\nhave a third eye and a capital \u201ci you know some way\nthat you can fight back by not allowing it to be turned on how would\nyou have control if they turned on something that you do not\nhave any control over well what happened with\nme is i was in a car accident about twelve years ago and i had to\nhave an mri done on my skull and it did not like the chip or\nthe chip did not like it so it is not completely\ndeactivated but it is been damaged enough what is\ngoing on now for some of us is this going to sound so\nunbelievable our alternate personalities are beginning to merge with\nour primary personalities what were once two people are now becoming\none and that is something that the illuminati the elite the\nbankers  whatever title you want to put on them  that is\nsomething that scares them to death because the alternate\npersonalities are integrating our memories our emotions that they\ncannot have am 2 you mentioned in the video that you\nhave some telekinetic abilities are you able to consciously control\nthese in this personality at this point i had sure love to see a\ndemonstration and also can you train other people\nin how to use some of the stuff you learned yeah the amazing randi [ed note james randi is a world-renown\nsuper-skeptic of paranormal phenomena would like to see that too most of any psy abilities that i have are tied into the\nalternate personality one of the reasons that i was a shooter is\nbecause i was best at being a soldier not the psychic spy not the\nremote viewer i was one of the worst remote viewers in the world you know i was more suited to be a physical augmented soldier am\n3 yeah hi duncan i have a book that is called mind\ncontrol of america\nand i understand that you were programmed as a soldier this book the topic of the book is about women that were groomed from the time\nthey were very small to be basically sex slaves for a lot of people\nwho are in power project monarch am 3 using dark ceremonies in order to control the kind of the orgasmic\nenergy into the darkness i was just wondering do you know about\nthis yeah that is kundalini magic that\nties in a lot of these programs use ritualistic magic and it is dark\nmagic so yeah i am aware of what you are talking about am\n3 yeah because she claims to have had sexual relationships with a\nlot of people in power throughout the years her and a bunch of women\nthat like you are starting to remember and have shattered multiple\npersonalities very similar stuff thank you am 4 hello and thank you for\nbeing here i read ender\u2019s\ngame\nand i just want to know have you read ender\u2019s\ngame\nand i guess have they tried to take people off-planet to cover it\nup and like how much of that is true or is it false i did not quite understand am 4 oh have you ever read\nthe book ender\u2019s\ngame\nby orson scott card no i have not i do not\nwatch movies i do not read books i stay away from it\nas much as i can am 4 because your story reminds me of\nender\u2019s\ngame basically orson scott card writes about grooming a six-year-old to\nfight the alien invaders that will be coming in the future but in\nender\u2019s\ngame what happens is that you know the government wants to cover\neverything up and so they ultimately take people off-planet so i was\njust wondering if you knew i am\nfamiliar with what you are saying but i really could not\nanswer anything am 4 okay great thank you thank you am 5 i guess we have all got books that kind\nof relate to this and mine is trance\nformation of america i am familiar i am familiar with it yeah am 5 in that particular book pedophilia was one of the means they used to\ncreate multiple personalities and i just wondered was pedophilia a\npart of your i have no memory of sexual\nabuse this is the reason i wanted to do the q&a every question\nis leading me into the explanation  i was wanting to get into my alternate was instilled due to trauma-based torture okay i was over a period of time what a lot of people think when\nthey see the previous interviews is that once i was taken from\nkentucky to wherever i went this was done instantaneous over one\nday no this took place over weeks and months all right we\nstarted out with being strapped into a wooden chair with the strobe\nlights being talked to slapped around i learned what\nwater-boarding was by the time i was seven okay then they would\nstart with the needles under the fingernails they would do one then\na few days maybe a week later two the purpose for this was to\nincrease the pain tolerance okay they wanted us to have a\npain tolerance that was unbelievable so that they could finally get\nto the point to where they could have all ten fingernails with\nneedles underneath and then an electric current being put through\nthem then i was given a drug so that i could not faint i could not\nblack out so at that point your psyche has a choice to\nsplit off to an alternate personality or die i split most of them\ndid not does that help am 6 i think you are very\nbrave to come to this sort of meeting i would think you would be\nat risk but anyway you were mentioning that there were initially\n1,000 recruits now did all 1,000 go through the program or you\nsaid there are only 20 remaining it is my\nunderstanding that only 20 of us are remaining alive the 1,000 that\nwere taken into the project in 1966 were the first-generation\naugmented individuals they were from all over the world i remember\nkids from australia england when i say from all\nover the world i am talking about the allies the allied countries that we had\nat that time i do know that the former soviet union was\nworking on a very similar program as well as china was working on a\nsimilar program there was one incident in my early 20s when i went\nup against one of my soviet counterparts i lost that one am\n7 how did your parents react to this did they have a problem with\nthat my parents i am\ngoing to be diplomatic no it is a good question it is\nan excellent question my father was in the cia that is how my\ninvolvement came about this is a generational project i have not\nspoken to my mother or my siblings in over 20 years and i have no\ndesire to what do they think about this they would probably as soon see me in the ground right now and\nthat is being diplomatic am 8 duncan i am very\nsympathetic with your state the severe trauma that makes the\nmultiple personality disorder and in fact most of our soldiers who\ngo abroad and experience trauma experience something called post\ntraumatic stress disorder right am 8 you have a very severe case of that and i would like to suggest if\nyou did not know about it there are some very good mind body\nmedicine techniques that can be used to really release the trauma and\nemotions connected with the trauma that could possibly lead to a\nhealing and when you said that you felt that the various\npersonalities were beginning to merge actually i think that is\nthe mind body trying to heal but i think the point is that\nyou want to get rid of the traumatic stress disorder so that you can\ngo back to being your whole self so if you want more information\nabout that i may be able to help you sure thank you the problem with that with the personalities merging when that begins to take place we really do not have a choice we either let the personalities merge together we let the implanted\npersonality take control which would not be a good thing or we\nbecome one person kind of right down the middle with the original and\nthe augmented something that at least has some emotions and some\nunderstanding of right and wrong the alternate personality\nhas at that time before they begin to merge has no emotions right\nand wrong means nothing \u2013 okay simply follow orders am 9 duncan thank you for being here and sharing with us\ntoday thank you am 9 it is\nprobably been a couple of years since i have seen your interview i was wondering if you could talk about the experience when you were\nin a team i guess you were youngsters when you came in i do not\nremember if you guys stood in a semi-circle or a full circle but you\ntook out the enemy could you discuss your perspective on the\nenergetic mechanics of what was going on how you did that and\nperhaps some of the other phenomenon that might have been similar yeah ah s-h-h-h do not tell anybody we were in cambodia we were not\nsupposed to be in cambodia during vietnam \u2013 okay but\nwe were there there are some people in this room that were there after we are finished if anybody wants to talk to them i will\nintroduce you we were thrown in as part of a rescue\noperation a couple of seal teams and oss [ed note office of\nstrategic services] teams were pinned down by khmer rouge fire the\nprocess by ah what we did i really do not have an\nexplanation but you are correct we came out and we formed a\nsemi-circle facing the direction of the enemy fire and we do have\nsome more information on that since we did the interview there\nwere twelve of us i was team leader consider each of us as an\nindividual acted as a battery and we transferred all that energy into\nsomething else \u2013 it was a thirteenth person but we do not\nknow who the thirteenth person was the thirteen again being a\nritual number the number of dead that day numbered in the\nhundreds we then got back on the chopper and we flew off am\n9 i take it that that was also another aspect of the training that\none of the other personalities is schooled in correct correct thanks thank you duncan for being\nhere you are very brave thank you i watched the video with dave corso and you seemed to have more\nmemory than he did he does not seem to have the memories that\nyou do or was he in your program or was he the\ngeneration that failed no corso was not in my\nparticular project he was in a different sub-project okay project\ntalent was not the only game in town with all this there were a\ndozen sub-projects going on for example project talent fell\nunderneath the umbrella of mk ultra mk ultra being a catchall phrase\nfor anything concerning mind control there were 172\ndifferent sub-programs under mk ultra \u2013 project talent being\none project talent was where i began and then i was moved as i said\na lot of times project talent\u2019s like going to school \u2013\nokay and i was moved from project talent to the ultimate\nwarrior project because i was more suited to be a physical soldier\nthan a mental psychic soldier to answer your question\nabout dave corso dave corso began getting his memories right the\ntime he should late 50s pushing 60 61 that is when the blocks\nbegin to wear down and the memories start to come together he got\nthem back right at the perfect time i got my memories back\nbecause of an automobile accident if i had not had the accident i\ndo not think i had standing up here right now i would\nprobably still be utilized and i would probably be in the middle east\nright now you had still be working i have no doubt that i would still be part of the program thank you yep hi duncan hi i grew up in eastern kentucky so i am very familiar with that area and the people that live\nthere one of the interesting things about that area was that in the\n1500s and 1600s a lot of the people that populate those mountains\nand areas were people from the british isles and they were i do not\nsay all i had say some were running from the\nlaw so they populated those mountains and they were very closely\nknit and still are in the community and my question to you is can\nyou talk about you mentioned that your grandfather was can you talk about that at all and how that affected\nyou i had two grandfathers at that time one\u2019s\nname was bull he was full-blooded cherokee the other was my\nfather\u2019s stepfather and i grew up more with my father\u2019s\nstepfather than i did ever what county or what town were you\nfrom ashland ashland okay i know where you are from yeah you are\nabsolutely right during that time the mountains were littered with\npeople that bail bondsmen would love to have seen they\nprobably still are in all honesty i have not been back\nthere in 17 years it is been that long since i have been\nback and i seriously doubt if i will ever go back okay duncan you talked about how the two personalities for those less\nthan 20 of you from your group who are still here are merging these\npersonalities right and the\npowers that be are fearful of that you said they do not want\nthat to happen right correct can you just touch a little bit on that and why what is causing\nthose two personalities at this time to merge what is causing the merging we have no clue and neither do they\nbecause it was not supposed to take place what terrifies\nthem about the two personalities merging my alternate\npersonalities one of my alternates i have four two of them we\ndo not know how they got there okay my primary alternate is\nknown as omega unit 197 he knows where all the bodies are buried he\nhas all the knowledge all the locations the dates the places the\nbank accounts etcetera imagine when we finally merge i will\nhave that knowledge in this personality that better terrify\nthem because i will\nturn it against them hi there i just want to\nsort of step in here and sort of help move things along here duncan you are doing a great job there is some interesting energy\nin the room right now miriam delicado are you in the audience is\nshe there okay if she is could she please come on stage thank\nyou this is dave corso bill are you with us thank you okay i need a little break for a\nminute we are just going to give duncan a little\nbreather here and i had like dave corso to say a few words to\nyou duncan does have more than one alternate and he is investigating\nthis very deeply you have to understand that once somebody does\nthat breaking down those walls makes them very vulnerable and\nif you have seen the recent terminator\nmovie it is no lie \u2013 okay so just follow that\ncharacter\u2019s trajectory in trying to find out what was done to\nhim and watch his emotions and you will have some clue as to\nwhat is going on here okay so if you have not seen the\nmovie i encourage you to do so because it is really remarkable dave corso dave corso (dc thank you to be where you are thank you let me explain to you how i met duncan in this iteration of life we\nhad a mutual friend named john morrow john morrow was the thirteenth\nmember of the team when the helicopter landed in inaudible broken up duncan\u2019s voice being picked up by mic overriding\ndave\u2019s voice] there is an energy that is\nworking in here now bring it on my team was\nsent to rescue another special forces-type team we had some\nproblems i called for backup well about 10 minutes later this\nch-47 chinook lands and these twelve kids get out what the hell\nwas this bullets flying everywhere there is this\nlittle kid with a big afro a white kid that one right there i said what\nthe hell\u2019s this before i could ask the question these kids formed a circle joined hands and there was a thunderclap and a flash of light like\ni have never seen i looked at the helicopter as my vision comes\nback and there is a guy and i said i\ndo not know this guy i do not even know what his uniform\nis he was an officer in the army i think to make a long story\nshort they flew away we got together our team that had come to\nrescue and i asked the master sergeant what\ndo you know what do you recall and he said a\nblinding flash and the bullets stopped there were hundreds of vietcong bodies as we wended our way back out and we got to our chopper and we got out of there about two\nweeks later in saigon i ran across this officer again and he had\nthis horrified look on his face he had an insignia on his shoulder\nthat i had never seen before okay that was 1967 let us\nfast-forward to 1992 i am in pahrump nevada in my computer\nshop and this guy walks through the door and my first instinct was to\nkill him and i said why\ndo i feel that way well as he introduced himself \u2013 his name was john\nmorrow \u2013 as he and i talked i could sense there was something\nunusual about this gentleman well john and i got to be good friends\nand one day after i had closed my shop john was over because i was\ndoing some work on his computer i said let\nme tell you john what i first experienced with you when you first\ncame in my shop i says my\nfirst instinct was to kill you and john morrow\u2019s face got ashen-white i said i\nknow you from vietnam i said when\nyou introduced duncan and i in this iteration you were surprised\nthat we knew each other and you were even more surprised that sean\nand i knew each other i said you\ndid not expect that he said no he gave me some more background on dunc because he\nwas one of dunc\u2019s trainers john morrow was a very\nunassuming gentleman when you looked at him you had think what\na big teddy bear john loved cats john loved my dogs john was my\nfriend but he was a robot there is a robot or two in\nhere today i no longer sense their being a danger but when i met\ndunc \u2013 and i am not telling the story about the yellow\nsnake either  \u2013 that is a story for\nanother time but you will not believe it and i did not my son i have a son that is named david thomas he\nhas an unusual knack of he will ask me what i think are stupid\nquestions until i think about it my nightmares started in\n1983 when my son and i are sitting in the little two-man rubber life\nraft fishing in strawberry lake in california he looked at\nme and said daddy i got a question for you i said what is\nthat he says what\ndid you do in vietnam what did you really do because at times man you just act really weird i said he is\nnine years old what is he asking me what i did in vietnam for i said i\nthink i did this that night the nightmares started dunc and i have been\nthrough iterations of life together as have allison and i and laura\nand i i am here to meet people to tell you this whatever\nduncan says you can take it to the bank dunc has other information that i\ndo not know if he is going to share today or not that i am\nprivy to he talked about teams of three well the third member is\nhere today i am the anchor dunc\u2019s the soldier\nand we have the outlook this iteration of \u201coutlook there are more than one i am so grateful that i live in this\ncountry i had an opportunity to go to work for the russians after my\nterm was over in the us military i looked at this guy and i said what\nyou are going to give me make me a major for six months get my\ninformation and kill me as i turned to walk away he was gone that quick it\nhappened on a street in oakland california you all have\ngood hearts and souls but i have seen one thing because my\ntalent is taking a mosaic and making a picture a lot of you\nhave a lot of the pieces we need to sit down as a group and not\ndesign a camel which is a horse designed by committee but sit as a\ngroup bring out one truth the truth stands by itself and what is\nthe truth well it is something that is politically acceptable\ntoday it may not be politically acceptable tomorrow well the truth is this relaying an event or situation exactly as it is\nwithout taking to or adding from that event to make someone right or\nsomebody wrong believe me i know that is true people say i am\ncrazy well i am not crazy it just happens you are not in\nmy normal realm i have wolves i raised\nwolves and i have a wolf that lives in my house he is a\npurebred wolf i thought he was mine i have a wolf\nnamed herk dunc and i made a 300-mile trip about a 400-mile trip\none way i took herk with me because i felt so inspired now this\nwolf was what four months old he was four months old he\ngot in the car just like it was normal a hundred and fifty miles\ndown the road he stands up and looks at duncan he looks at me and i\nsaid i\nthink we had better stop he had to do his thing he got back in the car we drove on we got\nto our destination and i thought to myself this\nis a purebred wolf this woman had two little dogs as i recall yeah and a cat and a cat my wolf got along fine with them woof thank you boy i appreciate that you had to do it did not you well i got a thing with dogs anyways as we were coming home we\nstopped at a well-known sandwich shop we got two burgers two for\ndunc two for me and two for the \u201cdog you know what my dog would not eat them he buried them in the seat i found\nthem the next day so much for lovin it i guess but\ni have had some amazing adventures with dunc sitting in my living\nroom like it says in my interview now stereo and things were\nturned off it should not make a noise right how about a loud\npop that hurts your ears have you ever experienced that electronics\ngo pop it is a psychic attack audience well you were there you should know either that or\nyour twin sister was there i have a lot of fun with life things\nseem to be clearer in the here and now and if they are not bring it on i am ready for ya that is right okay let us take a couple of the other\nquestions here you have got two people and you can ask either\none duncan has actually got a mic on him duncan say a few words so we can make sure it is working okay hi i am\njust wondering if we look x-ray photographs of your arm your\nshoulder and your head would we see anything interesting in those you would see metallic objects i have x-rays and\nphotographs of the implant in my left hand the cranial implant i\ndo not have one of the shoulders because i cannot seem to\nget my hmo to pay for it you think you could release\nthose online for us pardon could\nyou release those photographs online for us they\nare they are are they anywhere on your website they are on my website yeah thanks mm-hm it is www.duncanofinioan.com if you could say that website one more time www.duncanofinioan.com first i just want to thank you both for being here\ntoday and for being courageous enough to speak with us and tell your\nstories i do have a few questions one is project talent what were\nsome of the other talents that the children expressed and if you\ncould introduce us to some of them that are remaining today project talent like duncan said is a far-reaching program my\ntalent among others is taking a mosaic of little bits of\ninformation and giving you a very clear picture that has been\nbrought home this weekend there are people here that i was meant to\nmeet there is three in the back room right now i\nwas not taken for periods of time i was taken for the summers i was a summer school so to speak my training started when i was\nsix years old when my brother brought home \u2013 who happened to be\na staff sergeant in the marine corps at that time \u2013 brought\nhome a .22 target rifle that was part of my training because he was\nalso in early project talent as i found out later but i\nwould be gone in the summer come home in time to go to school and i\nhad all these memories of being with my uncle ed who was a peddler great con-man i asked my mother one time before she died i\nsaid mom i got a question for you she said what i said i\nhave these memories of being with my uncle ed in the summertime going out on the road she\nsays you\nwere never with uncle ed i said then\nwhat did i do she said when\nyou get older you will figure it out and mother gave me that smile that said you have\nasked enough questions mother god rest her soul went home in 1993 before she\nwent she showed me a journal she had kept of the time i was in the\nservice every time i got hurt every time something significant\nhappened on a mission she wrote down where i was what i was doing and where i got hurt and what the event was i said how\ndid you know this and she said i\nam your psychic anchor i said i\ndid not know that she said there\u2019re\nlots you do not know yet my mother god rest her was an angel boy could she be a\nholy terror i am different than dunc i do not\nhave any native american blood in me that i know of however i say\ni am sicilian that is because my mother was scotch-irish my father was purebred sicilian and i was raised by my grandparents and it is interesting to know that when i was talking to\nthe third member of our team friday morning i am laying in\nbed at my niece\u2019s before i come over here at 4:30 in the\nmorning and i said hey\nallie it is 4:30 send a message to him but he never gets it i ask allie i says what\nhappened at 4:30 this morning she said i woke up out of a sound sleep and sat up and said what is\nthis psychic abilities are alive and well i am just finding\nout what mine are i never thought to even question myself about it well last night we were sitting in the cafe allie and i\nlooked at each other at the same time and somebody was there somebody was there there was a psychic vampire was the second thing\nwe noticed robots do not know they are being used they do not know what training they have had they have no\nknowledge no memory so we cannot hold it against them\npersonally but understand as many people as there are are\ndifferent programs because everybody has different natural native\ntalents that have to be ah capitalized on and i hope i have\nanswered your question am 14 yes you did and i have two\nmore actually go ahead you almost\nactually led into them the second question is how can we locate communicate with the members of the subsequent programs the next\ngenerations that they were talking about and help them to understand\nwhat is going on with them i do not\nthink you want to we are the way we are without explanation we\ndo not have one as i said earlier we were never supposed to\nretrieve our memories at least not at this age i helped dave get\nhis back i got mine back due to an automobile accident so i woke up\nearly the generation of people that are in this project\ntoday which would be the fourth generation jeez that is a very\nscary thought to\ntry to locate one of these guys and communicate and try to reason\nwith that person if they are in an alter we have some information about the fourth generation that\ni think in the context of what you have told us we should maybe\nsay a few words about these soldiers are not human they can\nsit in a doctor\u2019s surgery and pass the tests and the doctor\nwould not know if it was not an invasive test blood pressure\nreading eeg ecg they pass the tests they had be a healthy strong-looking quite large muscular-looking man the person\nwho told us this once had a company had a corporation and the name\nof that corporation was cyberdyne anyone seen the terminator\nmovies okay this is a reference to what we heard yesterday about\nhow the reality merges into the hollywood movie industry as a way of i believe primarily as a way of disguising the truth because when\nsomebody says hey you know these stargates are real then they get laughed at because it was just something that came out\nof a movie script this is how they hide things like that cyberdyne is one of those examples the person who told us\nthis we pushed quite a lot we had quite an interesting conversation\nabout it and we were given to understand that one of the many\nfunctions of these soldiers for lack of a better word of course\nthey can go into space without any problem at all they do not\nneed to breathe and the numbers of these soldiers we were\ntold were something in the region of 15,000 they have never\nbeen deployed in combat we were told because then their existence\nwould be revealed but whoever the enemy is and we are not sure\nin this context they are given to believe that they exist but\nthey have never been used now that is pretty much\nall i know i had like to ask dave and duncan here whether this\nfits with what you believe you understand this is a conversation we\nhave not had it of necessity has to fit i mean bill gave an analogy with airplanes on the generations let us\ntake a better look let us take a look at computers in 1962\nwhen i was first introduced to computers they had almost fill\nthis room yet i have one sitting on my desk well i have six\ncomputers on my network at home i happen to like to play with\ncomputers that computer is three years old it has more computing\npower than the first five computers they built that were the size of\nthis room every it used to be every two years then it\nwas every 18 months and now it is every year they double the\ncapacity and abilities of microprocessor chips a microprocessor chip\nis about the size of a half-dollar used to be they had one computer\nchip system inside there then there was two now there is four same size chip so his analogy that he wants is what is\nthe fourth generation like they are probably in fifth or sixth\ngeneration by now that to me is absolutely terrifying and i am\nscared of damned few things in this world and we are not\ntalking about the yellow snake either all right i will confess i\nhate snakes listen long and short you do not\ncreate an army unless you intend to deploy\nthat army this fourth generation super soldier warrior soldier whatever you want to call it are some bad people i could not\nstop one i was the best we had at my generation i cannot stop one the possibility is very very real they will be turned loose on the\namerican populace what do you want to do about it i want to stop\nit if they turn this fourth generation loose on us we are\ntoast and they will try to reactivate each and every one of us in\nfirst second and third generation to join with them if we\ndo not expose them now and try to at least put up a blockade we\nwill not have a chance they are that good they are that strong they are that invincible we have very very little time in which to\npull this thing off so what do you want to do about it just a little data-point which i have just remembered we were\ntold that two of these can pick up an abrams tank laughter comments \u2013 inaudible]  i can do a\n1,000-pound dead-lift at 49 years old and a broken neck my neck was\nbroken in three places in my car accident i was never supposed to\nlift anything heavier than a cup of coffee i can dead-lift 1,000\npounds that is first generation what bill just said about\nfourth generation think about it i just want to\nadd that we have been told \u2013 okay cannot say\nwhere our source came from but that duncan\u2019s quite right that\nthe american people for one are targets could\nbe the targets of some of this army at some point in the future we\nwere also told that a war is \u201canticipated if you will one with china and two with visiting races off-planet \u2013 okay and that these \u201cbeings that are being created\nactually have the capacity to handle that situation and all of this\nis absolutely top secret absolutely the fact that duncan is\ncoming forward and dave corso and the fact that they found each\nother means that there is a power higher and more powerful than\nanything created by man it is testimony to that the fact that\nwe are finding each other there are some other people in\nthis audience today that found us and found dave corso and duncan and\nthey were involved as well and they some of them do not even\nknow how deep yet okay some of those people were used again against their will and i have to say that you know there\nare a lot of soldiers out there being used in very many different\nways that they do not realize there are also people sleepers all around us that are being used even at night in their if you want\nto call it their light-body being used being trained being\nutilized so this is a very deep rabbit hole so i just wanted to\nsort of paint that for you a bit what is a blockade say that again what is a blockade he\nmentioned we need a blockade what blockade blockade blockade oh no no no i said\nthrow up a block like playing football to try to put a block up so\nthat they cannot get to you information we need as\nmany people to come forward as possible we need you anything an individual can do even if it is as little as\nmentioning what is talked about here on a radio program even be a call-in even as much as writing your congressman i know that is\na waste of time but you can flood their offices i know i have\nwritten the president okay i get fan letters whatever\nyou can do because people this\nis a war make no mistake about it and we are going to be fighting an enemy\nthat you cannot imagine okay so we need help we need your help could we not just stop them by meditation is it not\npossible to change by actually projecting it right i mean we as\npeople have no strength but we have the strength of our thoughts that is very true absolutely very true and\ni appreciate everything you and others that i know in here that are\nworking right now okay that is very true but at the\nsame time we need a physical presence to show a physical presence\nthat we\nknow who you are we know what your agenda is we are going to\nstop you one way or another all the love and light works with it they compliment each\nother you cannot have one without the other that is the\npoint that i was trying to make and i do have a nasty habit of\nspeaking too fast because my brain works faster than my mouth and a\nlot of times it does not make sense so you just have to tell me\nto shut up say it again slow down with it and go it is my last question and after i will just offer one\npossible solution but i am glad you mentioned that everyone has\ntalents i was curious how the rest of everyone here as well as\naround the world can identify and develop their talents responsibly it is generally widely accepted that\neveryone has a certain degree of psi abilities we are born with\nthat if you are asking me how would you go about strengthening\nor enhancing that first of all stay away from anything that has\n\u201cproject on the beginning of it laughter from all and\napplause]  except for project camelot of course audience all right my mistake find a teacher find a teacher someone who is a\nwhite-lighter a true white-lighter and work with them let them\nteach you and then the possible solution it was\nwith a conversation with cynthia and another one of the guests she\nsaid that similar to what this individual was talking about if we\ncan send white light energy and love \u2013 call it prayer call it\nwhat you will to you know it is a radical idea but to the illuminati and to leaders out there so\nthat they can help to understand really what they are doing\nand so that they will have more love and actually change their minds\nto prevent unleashing such a super soldier force as well as helping\nto shield them in the same energies that are shielding you so that\nthe negative energies that are around them will not be able to be\naround them you raise an excellent point but however believe me the illuminati know exactly what they are\ndoing to pick up on what you are running with thought\nequals action so as the lady here said with the positive thoughts \u2013\nabsolutely you can manifest those positive thoughts into reality what you are saying has merit and it possibly has a chance but\nin the meantime we need to have some type of preparation if it\ndoes not work absolutely thank you so much i want to say something here what we are talking\nabout is awareness \u2013 okay being awake and being aware knowing becoming aware just the act of learning and becoming aware just what we are doing right here this creates the power okay it is not enough to just send blind light blind love \u2013\nit must be intelligent it must have perception attached you must do\nmore than just give the heart okay you must understand what you are\nseeing and why you are doing what you are doing so knowing and putting that piece together that is the missing\npiece and then it is awareness what you want to convey is the\nawareness of all the aspects of what is going on there okay so if you are loving you are loving consciously knowing all the parameters of what that means not blindly so do not\ngive your energy blindly if you want to give your energy and power\nand light and love to the illuminati know what you are doing be conscious while you are doing it miriam delicado\n(md i want to tell you that in that respect there is\nsomething that i have done in the past in a particular situation\nwhere there were so many people involved there were so many levels\nof understanding i really sat and i meditated and asked my contacts what\nis it that i can send to them so i sent one message i asked for every individual involved\nto see the truth to understand it and accept it because the truth\nwill come from universal understanding and not only truth on the\nlevel of life here so the truth would be that they are doing\nwrong and they would see it they would understand it and they would\naccept it and then there is no choice at that point comes change so send them and send the world that the world sees and\nunderstands and accepts the truth thank you so awareness is its best defense that is your defense total\nawareness that means that when the earth and all humanity is an\nawake being one awake being then nothing can stop you okay good morning gentlemen thanks for being here have either of\nyou tried hypnosis to try to fill in some of the blanks or merge the\npersonalities i know it is probably a silly question you\nprobably oh no it is not a silly\nquestion at all it is a logical assumption that we had done\nthat and the answer to the question is yeah i did once but i\ntried to kill the therapist the alternate took over and tried to\nkill the therapist i was\ngoing to volunteer we will save that this is an idea that some of us have actually bounced around for a\ncouple of years is that \u2013 if we can find a therapist who is\nwilling to do this \u2013 i would have to be chained to where i\ncould not move and then you can do what you do and if not\nif but when the alternate is triggered hopefully you had be\nsafe i am game okay we will\ndefinitely talk about it cynthia crawford (cc i have a\nstatement that is going to be very profound for you i have contact\nwith beings from other worlds and i have my whole life i have been the government has tried to kill me because i am a product of a\nhybrid program they created but recently when i was in\nlaughlin i was blessed to meet a man who has been taken out of his\nbed against his will forced on these ships and trained and this\nincludes his family trained to use alien technology to kill and\nbarbara lamb as some of you know did not know how to respond other\nthan did\nyou try using love and light on these beings to stop them and the gentleman said there\nis no amount of love and light to stop them and he was brought to me and i said to him if\nlove and light and all these religious different things people say send the power of the christ energy to them does not\nwork perhaps they are of the light and all of a sudden i was downloaded with information that\njust blew me away i found out there is a number of thousands upon\nthousands of sirian warriors of light that are on this planet now\nthat have the ability with the alien technology to protect the light\nworkers \u2013 not only to protect them they will kill them [ed\nnote killing the super solders that is if they have to and they\nare designed to go up against the super-humans and you would not\nbelieve what they are doing i have been shown the stargates as i know you guys know about the stargates what is going to\nhappen on the stargates you know about that i am\nnot touching that one i do know about the stargates okay well i have been shown what is going to happen in the\nfuture but i have to tell you you have to trust in the sirian\nwarriors of light they are here for a purpose many of them are just\nbeginning to wake up they also have with them besides the army\nthat is going to help fight against the super-humans they also\nhave people including a 13-year-old girl i met who can literally do\nhands-on healing and she is also sirian they are waking\nup they are getting ready they are preparing and they\nsaid there is an urgency now \u2013 now\n\u2013 to wake up we all need to put our own light and love behind\nthem and with them because we are going to have a hard job it is going to be very hard but we can do it thank\nyou thank you hi thank you for being here my question you mentioned yesterday on\nthe panel one of the positive things that you were doing kind of just\nfor the next year you had mentioned music but you had just\nmentioned that you do not watch television or anything like that\nor movies and i understand that your training was probably\ntrauma-based but there is music triggers as well so i am just\ncurious is there any music that you cannot or if anything\nhas happened if you have listened to any music what i was doing yesterday was using i think what i said\nabout if the government controls alien et disclosure i do not\nlike the music at that party i was just using that as a comic\nreference but to answer your question fully no i watch very little\ntv as far as music goes i stick with classical i like celtic\nmusic that is about it okay thank you duncan in light of the purpose in the whole way that camelot\nworks which is to expose and to be protected by exposure of truth have you guys thought about doing everything you could to get actual\nmemories with dates times who was killed where they were killed\nand a list of it that would fully expose the program and could have\na yeah that in some respects would\ndefinitely help to expose but it would not entirely expose what we have been doing is basically putting a call out for anyone\nwho is involved with these projects to get in touch with us and\nas i have made reference to with people over this weekend \u2013 my\ngroup that is my group we are all past unwilling\nparticipants in one project or another with this so we are\ntrying to come together and by coming together and talking and\nputting all this that is how we are getting the\ndates the places and everything combined what a lot of\npeople have to understand is that they may remember an event at one\ntime i will remember the exact same event with a different date then we will have someone else who was also part of this exact\nsame event but they remember it at an entirely different date and\nthat is done because when the memory is repressed into the altered\npersonality you are told it happened this date but if you could check it against the actual record and that is what we do that is why i said earlier i do not\ntalk about anything as fact unless i have three points of reference\nin fact i do the same thing well it seems\nto me people coming up and saying i\nwas this part of the program\nwithout being able to show what was done will bring people more into\nthe awareness for this exposure i have a question for\nyou what is your memory of what happened two hours ago very good  are you sure yeah it is different than mine is yeah i understand but does it make yours any the less true there is a physical does it make your memory of what\nhappened two hours ago any less true than what mine is yes or not i am not talking about our memories i am\ntalking about checking it against the physical universe i am going to give you an example here if you will just\nbear with me yes or no does it change your perception of what\nhappened two hours ago yes or no i actually would not judge my perception that way i would judge it by\nchecking it you have not answered my question all right the question is this what\nhappened two hours ago in your perception of what the world is and\nmy perception of what the world is are they the same no they are not by your admission does that make\nyours any the less valid it does not make either\none valid or invalid to me thank you you have answered\nyour question the fact is basically what\nhappens it also a lot depends on the age of the individual when the\nmemory comes back and as i said they also screw with the memories\nwhen they repress them and push them back into the alternate and they\nwill in that memory screw up the dates right right now as to what you were alluding to also is just\nbecause someone contacts us and says i\nwas in part of this project or this project does that make it so no it does not they have to go through\nour own little testing process to see if they were or they were not but to finish up with why we have the different perceptions\non dates we really do not have a correct answer but there\u2019ll\nbe a dozen of us we will remember the exact same event the\nexact same people there but i will remember it say spring he will remember it say the winter but yet the event\u2019s\nthe same the year will be different the month will be different i understand it just seemed to me that checking it\nagainst a historical record that is in public domain would have some\neffect i have got to do this the problem\nwith that is there is a reason these are called black\noperations they are not supposed to happen there are records but none that we are going to be able to take and look at so we\ncannot do that there is also time travel\ninvolved here and there is messing with there is\nimplanted memories false memories false dates there are layers\nupon layers so you know digging into this question is to\nactually look for real life events it is a rabbit hole there\nare so many levels based on what we have heard from various\npeople that includes the testimony of \u2018henry deacon arthur neumann okay there is also something on the\ninternet stephanie relfe who interviewed her husband called the\nmars records very interesting she used some scientology techniques as well as\nsome other healing techniques to get to the root of some of his\nmemories a lot of what he did happened on other timelines\nsimultaneously when he was other places i mean it gives you a\nbeginning of an understanding how the layers can happen we\nactually this is fascinating and this has been amazing thank you both duncan o\u2019finioan and dave corso and yes absolutely if i\ncould have your attention for one minute how many of you have ever\ngot a phone call you picked up the phone and there was nobody there how many of you use caller id to screen your calls let me\ntell you a little adventure i had i had a phone call it looked like\nmy son was calling me however when i picked up the phone there\nwere tones coming out of the earpiece on the phone it was not\nmy son calling me they can manipulate caller id to give you any\nnumber they want if you pick up the phone and you hear\nsomething funny or you think you hear something funny hang the\nphone up that is a very common way to initiate\ntriggers just be warned when you are called make sure you feel\ncomfortable answering the phone call if i get a call from an\nunknown number or an 800 number of a blank number i simply do not\nanswer the phone yeah i\nhave to say you guys are being mind-controlled \u2013 okay your televisions you name it the technical devices around you scalar weaponry it is not just these two guys okay it is\nhappening to all of us you must become aware in order to\nresist it so you need to know that these things telephone calls television programs various anomalous events that happen in your\nmidst pulses sent through stereo equipment actually wild\nthings we have had some things happen up here with some of this\nequipment same thing thank you very much for being here for\nthis thank you so much for coming "
