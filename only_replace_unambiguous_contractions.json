"\n\nCynthia Crawford, ET Sculptor \n\n\n\nCYNTHIA\nCRAWFORD (CC):  This is going to be an exciting time. I also have\nsome stories to tell you of people who have experienced the Beings\nafter having a sculpture. Now mind you, I am not allowed to sell the\nsculptures.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf\nthere\u2019s something you really want to buy, you may buy it, but I\nam not here to sell these, and I\u2019ll tell you why I do not\nsell these sculptures... I do not talk anybody into buying a\nsculpture.\n\n\n\n\nWhen\nI make the sculptures, first of all, they know who\u2019s going to\nbuy them. They need to get into the right hands. They identify with\nthe right person. If you do not feel a connection, I say do not\nbuy it; it\u2019s not going to serve you at all. Okay?\n\n\n\n\nThe\nother thing I tell people is you never want to buy a sculpture if\nyou are afraid to have contact. Okay? If you are afraid to\nhave contact, do not ever buy a sculpture because when I was in\nAlamo, Nevada, doing a conference, a gentleman who had had contact\nand never was allowed to remember who he had had contact with decided\nhe wanted to buy a Mantis Being.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo...\nhe bought a Mantis Being and lo and behold, a month later he\ncontacted me and said: I\nhave been downloaded with visions of what\u2019s going to happen in\nthe future. I have been given spiritual teachings to help me in\nmy ascension. But one night I woke up and there were three Beings in\nmy room!\n\n\n\nAnd\nhe said: I\ndid not expect it and so I told them \u201cGet out of here! I\ndo not want you in here.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd\nI said: Oh,\nthat\u2019s too bad. I am really sorry to hear that. Next time\nthey appear, this is all you have to do. Tell them: \u201cYou can\ntalk to me telepathically, but until I am ready to see you and\nexperience you, please just do it telepathically. Okay?\u201d\n\n\n\nLet\nme tell you a little bit about me, Cynthia Crawford. I was born a\ntwin. My mother... when I was born, I was born without an amniotic\nsac. My twin sister was born with an amniotic sac, but we had totally\ndifferent blood types and tissue types.\n\n\n\n\nWhen\nwe were five years old, my twin sister never learned to walk like a\nnormal person. She walked on her tiptoes and fell a lot and the\ndoctors diagnosed her with Muscular Dystrophy.\n\n\n\n\nMy\nfather, by the way, was in the Army and worked on Top Secret missions\nno one was allowed to know about. Okay? I do not know if that\ngives you a clue where I am going with this. Okay? This is what\nhappened.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\ndoctors took samples from me because they thought if they\ntransplanted my muscle tissue in my twin\u2019s legs, she might walk\nagain. They could not do the transplant. We were not matches,\neven though we were twins. It was as if we were never related.\n\n\n\n\nI\ndid not find out until I was in my early 30s, when my father came to\nme... and my mother and father were divorced when I was quite young,\nand\nmy mother was a very, very devout Christian and my father was an\nagnostic.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nmy father came to me and he said: Have\nyou ever wondered why you have always had contact with the\nBeings? Have you ever wondered why you have had babies taken from\nyou by the Beings? Okay?\nHave\nyou ever wondered why you are the only one in the family that\u2019s\nhad communication?\n\n\n\nAnd\nI thought: Where\nin the world did he get this information? I never told him about\nthis,\nbut he knew about it.\n\n\n\n\nI\nalso as a child who remembered being taken to underground facilities,\ngovernment facilities, when I was a toddler, and I would cry because\nI did not want to be there. They would take me to these\nunderground facilities and they would literally test me to see what\nabilities I had.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese\nwere military doctors and underground facilities many, many, many\nfloors below the surface, secret facilities. But I was always told\nthose were dreams, so I thought: Oh,\nwhat horrible dreams.\n\n\n\nBut\nmy mother never knew where she was going to find me when I was a\nchild, if I would be found outside, next to the door inside sleeping\non the floor, or in my bed. And as a teenager, I would sometimes wake\nup and I was outside, did not know how I got there. I also had\ntimes where I thought I was in bed and the next thing I know, I am\nfloating through the air up into a ship. I used to hate those\n\u201cdreams\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nWell,\nnow I am in my 30s and my father\u2019s telling me this, I\nfinally said: Why,\nDad? Why have I had contact? Tell me.\n\n\n\nAnd\nhe said: you are\na hybrid.\n\n\n\nI\nlaughed and I said: No,\nno I cannot be a hybrid,\nbecause that meant there was a reason why I never felt like I\nbelonged here.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut,\nI also found out at the age of 22, when I had my son and had\ncomplications with him, the doctors could not give me blood\ntransfusions for I had an antigen in my blood that only two other\npeople in the whole world had.\n\n\n\n\nNow,\nlet me tell you, if that does not make you feel a little bit\nweird, I do not know what does!\n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER (AM):  \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n No, I do not know them, but I will tell you this, when I had my\nson at the age of 22...\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nremember waking up before, of course, and I woke up after being on a\nship and the ship had the ceiling, walls, floors, all seemed to be a\nluminous glow to them and I was being told I was going to have a son.\nHe would do great things in the future to help save the planet Earth.\nAnd I thought: Whoa,\nI am going to have a son. He\u2019s going to be special.\n\n\n\nI\nwas so excited and I woke up in bed and I am telling my husband.\nHe goes: Nah,\nyou are not pregnant. No way.\nAnd I made a bet, and the bet was I would get a sewing machine and by\nGod that sewing machine came in handy. I made my maternity clothes!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway,\nI have had numerous healings my whole life. When I was 18 years\nold... because I always had a hard time fitting in; I used to be a\nvery depressed child and kept feeling this was not my home. So I did\na very stupid thing and I am sure you have heard of people\nlike me.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\ndecided to take an overdose of aspirins and end my life. I was tired\nof being on this planet and it was really stupid but I wanted relief.\nI wanted relief from the fear of being different, from the \u201cdreams\u201d\nof being in ships. I wanted help, and the way to get help was to die.\nRight?\n\n\n\n\n\nI\ntook an overdose of aspirins and if anybody knows what happens when\nyou take a bottle of aspirins, it works like acid in your body and it\ncompletely dissolved my vascular system. I was bleeding out of every\nopening in my body. My eyes... I literally went blind. My eyes were\nbleeding and I literally got down on my hands and knees, crawled to\nthe bed, laid down to die. I woke up the next morning healed, one\nhundred percent healed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt\nthe age of 29 I had real complications with my lungs. I was\nconstantly getting pneumonia and never knew if I was going to go into\na coma, did not know why my lungs were so weak. My twin sister\nhad died just two months before when I came down with lower-lung\npneumonia and both my lungs collapsed while I was out of town. I said\nmy goodbyes telepathically to God and everybody else.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nwoke up the next morning completely healed, came back to Omaha,\nNebraska, where I was living. The doctor took x-rays of my lungs,\ncalled me in to his office and cried, sat there and literally cried\nin front of me, and he said: You\nmust have something important to do in the future because these are\nnot your lungs. These are newborn-baby lungs.\n\n\n\nI\nalso was hit by a car in 1993 while I was walking across the\nstreet... thrown\n35 feet up into the air, 75 feet out into another street. All these\nbones in here were broken, had gone in and out my bladder. My colon\nand intestines were all twisted and knotted up. A part of my face was\ntorn off me. My ears were torn off me. I wear a plate in my shoulder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nwas told that it would take six to eight months for me to walk\nagain, but because my muscle tissue is Anunnaki, I walked in two\nmonths. But because my bones are Zeta bones, from my DNA, my bones\ndid not heal like humans. My bones took three times longer than a\nhuman. I have both Zeta DNA, Anunnaki DNA, and human DNA.\n\n\n\n\nAnunnaki\nis the greatest part of my DNA which attributes for my muscular\nbuild. When I did one time in my life start working out with weights,\nI developed the body of a weight lifter that would take one to two\nyears to develop that body, I did it in two weeks. Unbelievable. One\nday I looked in the mirror and go: I am\na man!\nI was so muscular. So I quit working out. \n\n\n\n\nBut\nanyway, it was not until after... When I had that accident, by the\nway, it took me five years to say complete sentences and to remember\none minute to the next. I had lost 1/3 of my brain and I had to learn\nall over again. It\u2019s quite an experience, a very humbling\nexperience.\n\n\nIn 1997 I decided to give up my fear of having contact and I started going to an experiencer group and I gave up my fear and I started having contact at least one to two times a week and I began going to other planets. I began going through teachings, spiritual teachings, which I did not expect -spiritual teachings of love.\n\n\n\nI\nstarted working with this group of experiencers and I gave up my fear\nand I started having contact at least one to two times a week and I\nbegan going to other planets. I began going through teachings,\nspiritual teachings, which I did not expect \u2013 spiritual\nteachings of love.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne\nof the first things they told me was: In\norder to be in the new world which will be coming soon, humans must\ngive up greed, judgment, and prejudice by looking beyond the physical\ncontainer to see the Creator-Source within each and every Being...\nNot within each and every human \u2013 each and every Being. Okay?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow,\nwhen I gave up my fear I said: Okay,\nby golly, I want them to come to me now. I want them to tell me: Why\nwas I the victim? Why did they want me? Why were they always taking\nme away? Why did they take my babies from time to time?\n\n\n\nI\nhad three conscious memories of having babies taken from me and I\nfound out I have 23 children on other planets. Part of it\u2019s my\nDNA.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors\ncould not explain why, when at the age of 24 I had to have a\nhysterectomy, why my tubes... and when I was 40 years old and they\nremoved my tubes and ovaries, why my tubes were like plump hotdogs\nready for a weenie roast. The truth was, they told me, that a panel\nof doctors had examined the tissue and it was perfectly healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nhad not one, not two, not three tubal pregnancies, but at least four\nor more. I only remember one because I remember waking up and having\na lot of complications with that tubal pregnancy that they took,\nand then I found that they used my eggs. What it had to do with was\nmy DNA; that\u2019s why they wanted me.\n\n\n\n\nSo\nanyway, getting back to when I gave up fear of having contact with\nthem and said: I am\nready for conscious...\nAfter three weeks of begging they finally appeared to me and the\nfirst one that appeared to me was one of the most incredible loving\nBeings I had ever, ever encountered, and the love was beyond words.\nThere is no human description for the love they give you. Okay?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\nhappened was, on the day that he materialized, I am laying in\nbed begging, of course, and here comes... almost like Star\nTrek...\nhere comes a body materializing in front of me, brown skin as\nwrinkled as elephant skin, very glove-leather soft. I do not\nknow what kind of lotion he used, but he was soft.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\nhad a large head which was large here, dented in the back here, and\nthen went out a little bit again and then to a long thin neck; long\narms, arms longer than humans; very muscular lean body; gold eyes\nwith slits, and he humbly looked down for fear he would frighten me.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll\nI felt was the most incredible love coming from him. It was as if God\nhimself had entered my room, and I had no idea I could feel this kind\nof love. I had never felt it from anyone and I said to him: May\nI hold your hand?\nAnd he rolled out three long fingers with suction cups on the ends.\n\n\n\n\nIs\nthere anyone in this room who has woken up with these bruises, three\nbruises on their thighs, legs, or somewhere? You have? And they look\nalmost like a suction cup type bruise? [audience member responds,\ninaudible] On your shoulder? Okay.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo\nyou know why we wake up with these bruises? It is not because we have\nbeen hurt, it is because consciously it is to alert us or let us know\nwe have had contact. Whatever happened, it is for us to remember it.\nOkay?\n\n\n\n\nSo\nthis guy shows me the suction cups on the ends of his fingers and I am\nholding his hand like... Oh, was that cool, almost like first love!\nIt was wonderful and I would do it again and again and again. But\nafter a while he said: Now\nit\u2019s time for you to learn from someone else,\nso I started going from Being to Being to Being and eventually began\nhaving contact with The Masters.\n\n\n\n\nThe\nMasters are not the people that tell you what to do and to worship\nthem. The Masters are here to tell us who we are, how important we\nare, all equal. There is no greater than and lesser than another.\nSananda, Ashtar, Mary \u2013 all of them are Beings.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow,\nlet us fast-forward a little bit and in 2003 one day while\ntaking a pot-throwing class, trying to learn how to use clay, they\nwere overbooked and they did not have enough wheels and so I sat\nthere most of the time just kind of waiting my turn and I started\nworking with the clay and the next thing I knew I had sculptured an\nET baby hybrid.\n\n\n\n\nLet\nme tell you, the people in this class were not open-minded like you\nguys. They thought it was freaky, creepy, and some of the people even\ntold the teacher: Do\nyou mind if you tell her not to make these in this room? \n\n\n\nSo\nI would make them in my home and I began having conscious contact\nwith these Beings where they were telepathically... I would be\nsculpturing and they would tell me how to make the eyes, the nose,\nthe head. By the way, one time I made the nose too big and they said\n: He\ndoes not have a Bob Hope nose.\n Ooo!\n\n\n\n\n\nOr\nthey would say: The\neyes do not bulge that much.\nOkay. Or: The\neyes are more slanted.\n\n\n\nWhat\nI did not realize right off the bat... They did tell me\ntelepathically: When\nyou make these Beings, they carry our frequency.\nI was only allowed to make Beings that work with the Light.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne\ntime I decided I wanted to make a reptilian but not the good\nreptilians. You know, there are good and there are bad, and there\u2019s\nnothing wrong with the bad, truly. The bad ones are just as important\nas the good ones because how do we know what love is if we have not\nexperienced what hate is? Or what pain is if we have not\nexperienced not being in pain? Believe me, when you have a lot of\nbroken bones, you know what pain is. \n\n\n\n\nSo,\nwe learn through experiencing the differences.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey\nwould never allow me to make negative ones and one day I saw this\npicture of a reptilian that people said \u201cRaped Women. Bad\nReptilian\u201d. I thought: Well\nhe\u2019s awfully pretty. I think I\u2019ll make him anyway.\n\n\n\nI\nSTARTED MAKING HIM, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE BEINGS SAID TO ME:  No.\nWE do not want you to do that one.\n\n\n\nI\nSAID: But\nI\nwant to.\n\n\n\nTHEY\nSAID: WE\ndo not want you to.\nNow, they speak in a collective, by the way.\n\n\n\n\nI\nSAID: I\ndo not care what WE want, I want to find out if I am an\nartist because I do not make these by myself. You work through\nme to make these sculptures. I want to find out if I even have any\nartistic talent.\n\n\n\nSo\nthey shut their mouths and I made a reptilian. He was gorgeous, and\nhe was perfect, and I was so proud. I pushed him off into the middle\nof this big, big six-foot-long island, grabbed some more clay and\nstarted making another sculpture, and the next thing I know, the\nsculpture goes flying off of the counter, smashed face down,\nunrecognizable, and the message was: That\nwhich you make, you bring that frequency into the world.\n\nOkay.\nI got it... only benevolent Beings.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwhat I want you to do, because when they told me their frequency is\nin these Beings, these sculptures, they told me... in fact they even\ncalled me a \u201cstraw,\u201d I am a straw through which the fluid\nflows, so when I do hands-on, they come through me and whatever\nsculpture I am making, they put their frequency in them and the\nlonger I work on them, the more empowered they are.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\nan example, one time... actually this last February when I was in\nLaughlin... Anybody go to Laughlin? Okay, good, a few of you guys\nwent to Laughlin to the International UFO Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\ngot home at midnight and I was so tired. I rode with another person,\nor I had another person ride with me... we were getting things out\nand he was not paying attention and one of the sculptures, a\nZeta, kind of a green looking Zeta, fell out of my car and broke.\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nso I thought: Oh\ndarn, I have to fix it.\nWell, it took me an hour and a half to fix it and I had to hold the\nhead onto the neck and then I had to rebuild the neck and\nblah-blah-blah.\n\n\n\nA\nParanormal Matrix\ncame out to my house to film me making sculptures and to show\npictures of all my sculptures... And by the way, this is going to be\non TV. I have not yet got a date for the release, but they will\nbe showing this on TV. As they are filming all the sculptures,\nall of a sudden they came to the one that had broken that I had\nrepaired.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause\nI put in extra time repairing it, it had so much frequency their\ncamera, which had a stabilizer in it, went nuts.\nIt was vibrating...  And let me tell\nyou, everyone there but one man who was an agnostic, everyone there,\nthere was eight crew people filming this, were \u201cbelievers\u201d.\nThey had never seen anything like this, ever.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have\nhad people take dowsing rods and literally set a sculpture down and\ntake a dowsing rod and go right up to the sculpture and when they get\nfrom 10\nto\n15 feet... if it\u2019s a sculpture that was broke that I had to\nrepair, they get 20 feet away and those rods would open wide up\nbecause of the kind of frequency they have.\n\n\n\n\nI\nthought they were joking when somebody told me that they used dowsing\nrods on it, so I started doing it (and I\u2019ll be darned if I\ndid not forget my dowsing rods), but they open up, wide up. I\nwas just absolutely blown away and going: Whoa,\nthat\u2019s okay. That\u2019s cool.\n\nMeditation Exercise:\n\n\n\nNow,\nthose who have sculptures, what I want you to do, first of all I want\neveryone, I want you to relax, take deep breaths, big,\nbig\ndeep breaths. Just totally relax and allow yourselves to be One. And\nthen I want you to, as you are holding the sculptures, or if you\nhave a necklace, hold the necklace and imagine that piece as if it\u2019s\nan extension of your arms and hold it. Allow it to become part of\nyou.\n\n\n\n\nAllow\nyourself to feel the energy. Feel the energy. You may feel tingling.\nYou may feel pulsing. It may even speak to you. do not be\nsurprised if it\u2019s telepathically speaking to you. Feel the\nenergy of\nthem.\nAnd while you are doing that I am going to tell you a\nlittle story.\n\n\n\n\nLast\nMay, a year ago May, when I was doing a conference in Alamo, Nevada,\nthe day before I left to do the conference, I was told to sit down at\nthe computer and to write. And all of a sudden this was what came\nout:\n\n\nThe\nSource was,\njust was\nAll That Is. The Source knew all, was all. And the Source decided\nthat it wanted to know what it was like not to be all, not to know\nall. So the Source made Selves and the Source made worlds for Selves\nto live on, and each Self would have a container that it would be\nallowed, to live on these planets. Source Selves are the Light, the\nSoul-Light connected to the Source. \n\n\n\nI\ndo not have time to do a regression tonight but I will tell you\nthis that I did a regression with these people. I took them down and\nI took them to another planet and I started introducing, one by one,\neach of the Beings to them. Then I took them from the planet and the\nplanet disappeared, and all of the Beings throughout the universe\nthat I had introduced them to, they all were holding hands. Then all\nof a sudden I had their bodies, their containers disappear, and all\nthat was left was their Source, their Source-Light, the Soul within.\n\n\n\n\nNow\nimagine a circle of lights. Now imagine off in the distance in outer\nspace comes a big, big bright light and it\u2019s moving quickly\nthrough the universe and it comes down in the center of all these\nlittle Light Beings. The Big Light is the Source-Creator,\nthe Source itself, All That Is. And all the little lights that\nrepresent the Souls of the Beings throughout the universe are all\nSource-Selves and the Light expels umbilical cords that goes out to\neach and every light so it looks almost like a wheel with the spokes\nin the middle.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\nare all connected to those of the universe and you have contact with\nthem. It\u2019s simply by releasing the container, going within,\nconnecting with the Source, the Creator of all, and opening up your\nheart to communicate with your brothers and sisters throughout the\nuniverse.\n\n\n\n\nWe\nare all here for our lessons. We can be teachers to one another and\nwe can be soul brothers and sisters and share our lessons, but in\nevery lifetime we have a certain set of lessons that allows us to\ngrow spiritually, and that\u2019s what life is about. We are on this\nplanet, Earth, at this time, one of the most precious times ever in\nwhich we actually get to experience the release of an old world and\nthe bringing in of a new world.\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nwe get to be those people who start the new world over. That what\nwe\nwant to see in the new world is that which we need to be now. When we\nbegin living what we want to see in the world, we change the world.\n\n\n\n\nNow\nI want you to feel the energy inside these sculptures and let the\nfeeling of that energy move into your heart chakra. Connect with it.\nthey are asking you to feel their love. Allow that love to\npenetrate your heart and exchange love with them. Give the love back.\nGive them love.\n\n\n\n\n[several\nmoments of silence; meditation ends]\n\n\n\n\nWhen\nyou go home at night or even tonight here if you are staying at\nthe hotel, close your eyes and meditate and do this. Connect with the\nSource, connect with the Beings and say: I\nam no longer afraid. My heart is open. I am ready for contact.\n\n\n\nThe\nonly thing you need to know that\u2019s going to help you through\nanything and everything in this world that we will face, or are about\nto face, is unconditional love and living the Light.\n\n\n\n\nIf\nyou think there\u2019s a chance that somebody may be of a negative\nenergy, you can dissipate any negativity simply by enveloping them in\nthe Light and sending them unconditional love.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nhave been attacked many times by the Illuminati and by the\ngovernment, the secret government, who because I know who I am and\nhave spoken up about how we are all connected; they have tried\nto take me out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\nliterally have been times the Illuminati have actually tried to take\nme out by causing me to... One time I woke up after being drugged by\nthem and they had injected me with a serum that caused an aneurism in\nmy brain, but right before my brain was to pop, all of a sudden I\ncried out for my guides, for my Beings, and said: If\nyou want me to finish my mission, then heal me!\nInstantly I was out cold and an hour later I woke up \u2013 I was\ncompletely healed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone\nthat does anything negative to you, if you return negativity with\nnegativity, anger, hatred, resentment, any of these things, this is\nwhat\u2019s gonna happen, you are going to empower them. Why\nnot keep your power? We can empower ourselves with unconditional love\nand enveloping the Light around all those people that we want to\neither to teach to empower themselves or that we want to diffuse them\nof their negativity.\n\n\n\n\nI\nhad a friend that told me that when she stayed over at my house one\ntime, she woke up in the middle of the night and there was a\nreptilian carrying me \u2013 I was out cold \u2013 carrying me\naway.\n\n\n\n\n\nSHE\nWALKED UP TO HIM AND HE WAS A BIG ONE AND SHE SAID TO HIM:  Put\nher down now!\n\n\n\nAND\nTHE BEING TELEPATHICALLY SAID:  What\nare you gonna do about it?\n\n\n\nAND\nSHE SAID:  I am\ngoing to love you,\nand immediately he put me down.\n\n\n\n\n\nDarkness\ncannot handle the Light. let us be in the Light and let us\nchange this world. let us take our power back.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\nwant to take your power back? Everybody want to take your power back?\nlet us do it now. let us do it now. How many of you would\nlike to have contact?  All right! That\u2019s\nwonderful. I am so happy.\n\n\n\n\nCall\nthem to you. Open your hearts to them.  Give them love. They may not\ndo it the same moment you do that. It took me three weeks of begging,\nbut then it\u2019s like I have contact all the time. Sometimes we\nhave to beg a little and sometimes we just have to be patient, but\nnever stop giving them love, for when they feel your love they say:\nOkay.\nthey are ready.\n\n\n\nOkay.\nOh boy. Okay. I am not sure if I am seeing this correct.\nWhat time do you guys have? Okay, I guess we have got a little\nbit more time.\n\n\n\n\nI\nwant to ask... \n\n\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER (AM):  \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n You did? What colors did you see?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n There was a deep purple alternating with almost like a tan, and then\nit went white.\n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n Just with my eyes closed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n Oh yeah. I have been holding it for...\n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Did you feel anything? Did you feel any vibration or anything?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n I did not. I did not. And then it went completely black...\nand one my challenges, I can never make a black screen, but this was\na completely black screen, you know, like your blouse or my shirt,\nand then white came back again.\n\n\n\n\nAMs\n\u2013 SEVERAL VOICES:  \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Okay. let us see, lavender was your first?\n\n\n\n\n\nAMs\n\u2013 SEVERAL VOICES:  \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Okay. Lavender represents your spiritual self.\n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n you are talking about the third chakra?\n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Yes. Yes, it is but it also represents wisdom. you are being\ndownloaded with some wisdom. And what were the other colors?\n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n White.\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n White is the highest color of ascension. Anybody have any\nexperiences while holding the sculptures? Okay. What was your\nexperience?\n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n I was meditating, I felt like pulsating in my head, vibration, just\na vibration in my head, right\nhere.\nIt was like pulsating.\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Okay, who else felt it?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n And light.\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n And light? All right! Anybody else?\n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \nViolet\nand bluish.\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Violet\nand bluish.\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \u2026 and vibration.\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Vibration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Excellent.\nOh good! I get a lot of people tell me they start feeling vibration.\nI sent sculptures to two different women who had experienced a\nNefilim\n Child\nand\nboth of them, when they picked the packages out of their post box...\n... it\nvibrated, like that. \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Yes.\nAnd you?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Pulsation.\nThat\u2019s common.\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Ooooh,\nWow. Communication there! She felt like she wanted to cry. Wow.\nThat\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\nparticular one is the Anabua.\nThe Anabua have cried for the planet Earth because of the abuse that\nhumanity has created, so the Anabua are all about Nature. they have\nagreed at this time at the end of the old world, to come here to\nactually give us... they are going to check out... As we are\nmoving into Stargates and so forth, they are here as well to watch\nthe way, to let us know if there\u2019s any danger ahead and so\nforth. Anybody else? Yes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Oh\ngood. She had a broken hip at one time that you have had surgery\non. Is that right? And she felt a healing ache.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow\nI will say this, a few people have actually experienced healing.\nThere is a woman who recently was given a sculpture, it was the\nAndromedan\nChild,\nand what happened with the Andromedan Child, she now uses it... she\u2019s\na Reiki master? Actually it opens up peoples\u2019 chakras and has\ndispersed all negative energy, anything attaching to people.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\nreceive emails from a lot of people who have experiences.\n\n\n\n\nIt\nlooks like we are going to have to end this. I really apologize.\nI was really hoping we could have a much longer time. Maybe I can\nfind a time tomorrow if Kerry and Bill, you know, are able to fit me\nin, where we can sit down and talk some more because it\u2019s...\n\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Yeah,\nmaybe during lunch break. I am not sure if they are going\nto do that other thing at lunchtime, but I\u2019ll talk to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nthing we need to be cognizant of...  Pardon?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Yeah.\nThe thing we need to be cognizant of... we need to just relax, to\nstop judging, and start loving. We need to be cognizant that we are\nall connected to the universe. We take our turn from planet to\nplanet, learning the lessons we have chosen. What it all boils\ndown to is when we leave our physical container, we get to go back to\nthe spiritual plane and communicate with one another the lessons\nwe have learned.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen\nI gave up my fear and learned to love these Beings, oh my gosh, I\ncannot get enough love. It\u2019s like sometimes it\u2019s\nhard being in my body!  It\u2019s wonderful.\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Oh\nno, I am allowed to sell them. I am not allowed to talk\npeople into buying them. You may buy them. If you are really\nconnected to one and you feel drawn to it, you may buy it. But what\nI am saying is I cannot talk anybody into ever buying one for\nthey know who their owner is and you will know.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have\nhad people walk past my booth when I have been at shows and\nthey have turned around and they\u2019d go: I am\nsorry. What?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019LL\nLOOK AT THEM AND GO:  I\ndid not say anything.\n\n\n\nAND\nTHEY GO: Ohhh...\nyour sculpture\u2019s talking to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have\nhad people actually see the sculpture... and you have to be very\nopen-minded and not afraid. they have actually seen for example,\nMary...\nI\nmean, call her \u201cMary\u201d; she\u2019s the Blue Lady, the\nplaque of the Blue Lady\n\u2013 she\ncarries the Mary energy and Isis energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have\nhad people tell me that the plaque actually became an entire tall\nBeing and actually came to her the night she got it. Then it came\nback a second time that night and brought two other Beings from other\nplanets and said: Well,\nif you are open enough for me, here\u2019s some others that\nwould like to meet you.\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n That\nis a Tall\nWhite.\nCharles Hall wrote books, the Millennium\nseries [Millennium\nHospitality,\na trilogy], about his experience while in the Air Force meeting with\nTall Whites? They literally have come to this planet numerous times,\nthey have for hundreds and hundreds of years. Actually, many of them\nstill live here.  Yes?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nI\novercame my fear when I got doggone tired of being a victim, when I\nsaid: I\nam so tired of them coming and getting me when I do not want\nthem to and when I do not know what they are doing... they\nwill not let me remember.\n\n\n\nAnd\nfinally I said: I am\ngoing to find out and the only way I can find out is to give up my\nfear and say: \u201cOkay guys, why me?\u201d\nAnd they came to me, finally, after three weeks of begging. And I\u2019ll\ntell you what, after I started experiencing them... I do not\ncare.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey\ncome to me a lot. I have even... Does anybody have the Ant\nPeople\nplaque? Anybody took the Ant People plaque?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Ah\nyes! Let me tell you the story about the Ant People. I did not\nbelieve that the old world was going to end and there was going to be\na new world. I kept thinking: Enh...[makes\nsound of skepticism] you know.\nI\u2019d\nheard about what happens in 2000 and so forth.\n\n\n\n\nSo\nin 2006 one night I woke up in the middle of the night, potty break\ntime, and got up to go to the bathroom, and I noticed that there was\nan Ant person\nabout five feet tall standing beside my bed. As I looked around,\nthere was another one by the fireplace, and another one by the\nstereo. And I am going: Whoa,\nwhat a dream. I cannot... this is not real.\n\n\n\nI\ngot up to go to the bathroom and I put cold water on my face, slapped\nmyself a few times, almost slapped myself silly, and I came out and I\nsaid: Okay,\nif they are real, they are going to be there when I come\nback.\n\n\n\nI\ncame back and, by God, they were real! I did not know who in the\nworld they were so I sculptured them. Anybody know of Chris O\u2019Brien?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n Yes.\nChris O\u2019Brien, The\nMysterious Valley\nand so forth? He\u2019d spent... I think it was six years living\nwith the Hopi? Interestingly enough about Chris O\u2019Brien, I will\ntell you, he thought I was a phony. When he saw all the sculptures I\ndid, he said:\nYou cannot tell me you have had experience with these\nBeings. I will not believe you. \n\n\n\nAnd\nwhen I pulled out the Ant People sculpture (I actually made an entire\nsculpture), he goes: Oh\nmy God! The Ant People.\n\n\n\nI\nSAID:  The\nwhat?\n\n\n\nHE\nGOES:  The\nAnt People.\n\n\n\nAND\nI SAID:  Who\nare they? \n\n\n\nHE\nGOES:  Well,\nlook it up,\nand he gives me this website to go to, and I read  the Hopi\ntalking about the Ant People.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo\nwhen I came back from that seminar I meditated one night and I said:\nOkay,\nI have very open-minded. I would like to go down into the inner\nworld, inner Earth, to their den and see what their den looks like.\n\n\n\nAnd\noh my God, what a joy! They literally have claws kind of like crab\nclaws on their feet and hands, and they have antennas. Now, anybody\nknow why the antennas, why they have antennas?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n No,\nthey have these antennas... Do you remember My\nFavorite Martian?\nAre you old enough for that? \n\n\n\n\n\nWell,\nwhat I did not realize was the antennas were because they pick\nup frequency.\nThey know us not by our face nor by our name, but by our frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy\nBeings told me our soul... when we were created, our soul has a\nfrequency that is our identity we carry. No matter how many\nlifetimes, no matter what planet we live on, we always carry that\nfrequency. They can find us whenever they need us. They zoom in on\nus.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nwhat happens is, the frequency intensifies as we become more and more\nspiritual. Okay? It\u2019s wonderful.\n\n\n\n\nThe\nAnt People... their only purpose is to bring us to inner Earth when\nthose who are meant to start the new world over again, after Mother\nEarth has shaken herself free of \u201cthe fleas\u201d...\n\n\n\n\nI\nactually had a communication once with Mother Earth, and I thought:\nWhoa,\nnow this is really pushing the button there!\nI\nhad no idea Mother Earth was a sentient Being.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll\nof a sudden she wakes me up in the middle of the night and she says:\nI\nhave to cleanse myself, for humanity has been very angry, very\nnegative, very hateful, very greedy and jealous.\n\n\n\nAlthough\nmany of you are ready to graduate... we are going through a\ngraduation for spiritual Beings\n\u2013 we are\ngoing to graduate from the lower density. So she said during this\ngraduation she must shake herself clean of all this negativity and\nthere will be a new group of students coming to Earth. Many of us\nhave chosen to go to the new world and start the world over.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome\nwill go back to the ships where they came from, others will go back\nto other planets, and some might just be Guides for others. You know,\nas we have Guides that speak to us? We may choose just to kind of\nrelax, hang back, and just be a Guide and talk to people\ntelepathically  like I have had the fortune of having.\n\n\n\n\nSo,\nany other questions?  Yes?\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n She\nwants to know if it\u2019s true about the ascension, and will Earth\ngo into a fourth or fifth density?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\nknow, your truth is there in your heart, but I am going to tell\nyou what they told me and then I am going to tell each and every\none of you, if you want to know the truth, connect to the Source\nwithin, for your truth belongs to you. No matter what anyone says or\nno matter what you read, your truth is yours. Okay? We only share\nwhat we think is our truth. Okay?\n\n\n\n\nWhat\nthey told me... and what was interesting is I was driving one evening\nor afternoon with John Mack\u2019s assistant, Maria, and I was\nexplaining the new Earth. I was told that, as an atom splits, so too\nwill planet Earth split and become two worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt\nthe moment that I told her this, a rock dropped from a truck and hit\nmy windshield and I had two big overlapping round holes in my\nwindshield. is not it an expensive lesson? But it got the point\nacross. She understood then, but it showed the two Earths splitting.\nI have a photograph of this. I thought it was worth photographing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut\nwhat I was told was that Earth will always be a third-dimensional\nplanet, but there is a new Earth that will be a higher density planet\nwhere those who have already learned their lessons and have graduated\ncan go and start the world over with higher-conscious Beings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\nother Earth is always there as a school for the new class of people,\nof Beings coming in, that are ready for their lessons. So it\u2019s\nkind of like being in school.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nkind of like we are going to graduate high school this year...\nor this lifetime, excuse me... this lifetime. It might be this year!\nWho knows?  2012 may come sooner than we think. So that\u2019s\nwhat I understand is going to happen.\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\n\n\nCC:\n In\na higher dimension. He asked where the new Earth, the higher-density\nEarth, will be. It\u2019s going to be in a higher dimension. What we\ndo not understand because we are living in a\nthird-dimensional world... we have to learn to see outsight the box.\nThe new Earth is in a much higher dimension than we are now.\n\n\n\n\nAM:\n \n\n\nCC:\n Yes.\nWe just have to open our minds and to accept whatever they are\nwilling to teach us about this. Every time I think I know it all\n I find out how much more I need to learn. So I say: reach\ninside your hearts, connect with the Source, and your answers will be\nthere.\n\n\n\n\nIf\nyou guys have any questions for me, feel free at any time to come up\nto my booth and ask them. I am going to call it quits now so we\ndo not interfere any more with the music that\u2019s going to\nbe performing here. So I hope you all enjoy the evening. Thank you so\nmuch!\n\n\nClick here for the workshop video\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntroduction\nby Jordan Maxwell:\n\n\nJORDAN\nMAXWELL (JM):  we are very fortunate to have Robert \u2013 Bob\n\u2013 Dean with us because Bob Dean is really an inspiration to\neveryone.\n\n\n\nBob\nDean, whether you know it or not, kind of dropped out of sight for a\nwhile and has not been doing too many conferences and not very\nmuch radio. I talked with him recently and he confided in me that he\nhas not felt much like talking because he\u2019s been doing so\nmuch of it.\n\n\n\nI\nfelt the same way because I have been kind of quiet, myself, since\n9/11. I became very disenchanted with the country I live in since\n9/11, but seeing Robert Dean coming back into the speaking circuit\nwas an inspiration to me.\n\n\n\nI am\nvery inspired to see my dear friend Robert Dean decide to come back\nand begin to talk with us again because I believe what he has to say,\nand just his appearance, just his person, is enough to inspire many\npeople. So, that\u2019s why I asked if I could have the pleasure of\nannouncing him, my dear friend Robert Dean; I call him Bob.\n\n\n\nSo,\nhe\u2019ll be here any moment, if you will take your seats.\n\n\nRobert\nDean and I go back a long time. Back in Mesa, Arizona, back in the\nvery early \u201990s, I met Bob Dean for the first time at a\nconference. He was speaking there and afterward he was so gracious.\n\n\n\nI\nwas very impressed with Bob Dean and he invited me to go out to\ndinner with him. I was nervous \u2013 I am in the company of someone\nI admire \u2013 but he was very encouraging to me and he was very\neasy to befriend.\n\n\n\nSo,\nI have been inspired by Bob Dean over the years. We just talked\nrecently and as I said, he told me that he has decided to begin to\nspeak to the public again, which has actually inspired me to do the\nsame.\n\n\n[applause/\nshouts/ whistles]\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s\nso much I would like to be able to say that I have been quite\nliterally afraid to say in public. The Bush regime frightened me,\nscared me, and if you know what was really going on with the Bush\nregime, it would scare you too. It was a frightening presence on\nAmerican soil, the Bush regime.\nWhat\nwe have got now is not much better.\n\n\n\n\nNow,\nthe next speaker up is Bob Dean... [4:02\n- overtalk \u2013 Bob Dean and Bill Ryan can be heard discussing\ntechnical stuff in the foreground.]\nHe's been an inspiration to me. He is back now on the speaking\ncircuit.\n\n\nSpeaking,\nas Bob and I do, almost all speakers at these conferences will tell\nyou that it\u2019s not an easy being a speaker at conferences. There\nare many downsides to doing this kind of work.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s  sometimes and costs a lot. It costs you in\nrelationships, because you are on the road a lot and it\u2019s\nnot easy to speak to a  audience, believe me.\n\n\n\nBut,\nthere are some upsides to being a speaker, there are some perks and\nnice things that you get from speaking.\n\n\n\nOne\nis that you meet some very interesting and fascinating people, and\nyou become friends with some very lovely and decent people, and Bob\nDean is one of the finest men I have ever met.\n\n\n\nI\nwant to be able to introduce Bob as not only my dear friend, but one\nwho has not only impressed me, but inspired me. As I said to you\nbefore, now I am saying it for his benefit, for him to hear.\n\n\n\nBecause\nhe has come back into the speaking circuit and began to talk with us\nagain \u2013 I think it would be a loss if he did not \u2013 I\nhave been inspired to come back into the speaking circuit and begin\ntalking again. \n\n\n\nSo,\nwithout further ado, the man I am introducing I love and admire,\nand a fascinating man, and I would suggest you listen closely,\nbecause he\u2019s got a lot to talk about that he knows first-hand.\nRobert \u2013 Bob -- Dean.\n\n\n[applause/\nshouts/ whistles \u2013 Bob hugs Jordan as he comes on stage.]\n\n\nBOB\nDEAN (BD):  The check is in the mail, Jordan.\n\n\nJM:\n As long as it does not bounce, that's the main thing.\n\n\nBD:\n It will not bounce.\n\n\nJM:\n Okay.\n\n\nBD:\nThank you.\n\n\nPresentation\nby Bob Dean:\n\n\nBD:\nI was in the back of the room back there and I did not realize\nthat this scoundrel here, Bill Ryan, was going to come up with an\noverhead projector, so I had to rush up to my room and grab my\ntransparencies.  So, I have got a few pictures to show\nto you that I think you might find interesting. \n\n\nI\nwant to say it\u2019s an honor to be introduced by someone like\nJordan. He\u2019s one of the foremost scholars of our time, and I\nhonor and respect him, and as he said, we are old friends; we go\nback a long way.\n\n\n\nI\nalso want to say a word or two about the young man who was up here on\nthis podium before I showed up here. Rich Dolan is very special. He\u2019s\nprobably one of the foremost historians of our time, and I strongly\nurge you \u2013 encourage you \u2013 to not only buy and read his\nfirst volume, but get the second, because I am waiting\nexpectantly for Volume Three.\n\n\n\nThat\nyoung man has pulled the cover back from this cover-up and the\nscandal that we have been living through for the last 60, 70\nyears, and I take my hat off to him.\n\n\n\nI have\nknown him for some time and I am so encouraged by young men like\nhim that are picking up and going with this program, because as I am\nsure all of you know, I am a member of the old guard and we are\ndiminishing daily \u2013 literally. Not a week or a month goes by\nthat I do not hear that some of my old cronies are gone.\n\n\n\nthey are\nnot gone...\nthey have just crossed back; they are Home now, but I miss\nthem, and I am gratified to see some of the young men coming\nalong that are filling the space for us.\n\n\n\nI am\nalso gratified to look out and see you guys because you are the\nreason I am here. I do not speak publicly much anymore. I\nfind it inconvenient. I hate like hell to travel in airplanes.\n\n\n\nI\ngot back from Spain here at the end of July and I had to go to bed\nfor a damn week. \n\n\n\nThen\nI went through Kennedy Airport and I was outraged when I looked\naround at Kennedy. It\u2019s a national disgrace. I mean, it\u2019s\ndirty, the broken furniture, the service is rotten, the restrooms are\nfilthy and most of them are closed. It\u2019s terrible to walk\nthrough Kennedy having gone through the airport at Barcelona and\nseeing new and modern and...\n\n\nOh\nmy God! Those Spaniards are really something else! They put on a show\nthere, in Barcelona, the last week in July that was outstanding.\n1,500 people showed up and they had standing room.\n\n\n\nIt\nwas a hell of a good conference and I was honored to be invited\n Steven Greer, Steven Bassett, who I will touch upon\nbriefly in a few minutes. I was gratified by the Spaniards \u2013\nthey are great hosts and they are very enlightened and very\ninterested in this subject.\n\n\nAs\nmany of you, I am sure, know, this subject has been my favorite\nsubject now for over the last 20 years. I have been on this\njourney for 45 years, but I have been speaking publicly for the\nlast 20.\n\n\n\nI\nspeak bluntly, openly, and I violate my National Security Oath every\ntime I open my mouth,  and I plan to violate my National\nSecurity Oath tonight. \n\n\n\nBut\nagain, a special thanks for you guys because I would not be here\nif it were not for you. I am so encouraged by the people I\nmeet at these conferences because, not only are you open-minded, but\nyou are enlightened, and you are enthused, because I think\nyou have learned, as I have, that this subject is, in my opinion,\nthe greatest story in human history, because\nit is the story OF human history.\n\n\nwe are\nnot alone, guys, and we have never been alone. We are members of an\ninfinite universe filled with infinite intelligent life. We have had\nan intimate interrelationship with several advanced extraterrestrial\nintelligences now for, oh, at least 10,000 years.\n\n\n\nThe\nevidence is pretty overwhelming that at least one, perhaps two, of\nthose different groups had a hand in engineering the human genome\nover 100,000 years ago. That evidence is literally overwhelming.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwe are going to touch upon a whole bunch of stuff, and I want\nyou to understand, I have come to the point in my life where I have\nbecome almost\nsympathetic to the government for keeping the lid on this thing.\n\n\nThey\ndo not know how to lift the lid on this subject. They do not\nknow how to lift the lid on Pandora\u2019s\nBox, because when they\nlift the lid just a little tiny bit \u2013 boom\n\u2013 the whole damn thing is going to come out, and nobody\nin government is prepared for that, because the story is so damn big.\n\n\n\n\nI\nknow that many of you \u2013 probably most of you \u2013 are aware\nof the famous Brookings Report. NASA gave a contract to the Brookings\nInstitute in the late \u201950s, and the basic point was simply\nthis: Try to find out \u2013 What\nshould we do if we, in the future, should encounter advanced\nextraterrestrial intelligence?\n\n\nThey\nworked on this thing for three years, published it in \u201961,\ndelivered it to Congress in \u201961, and they concluded as a result\nof this study that, if we should, indeed at some point, run into\nadvanced extraterrestrial intelligence, it would probably be a good\nidea to keep your mouths shut and not tell the masses of people.\n\n\nNow,\nMargaret Mead\nwas on the committee,\nand she\u2019d had experiences in the South Pacific with primitive\nsocieties where they had been confronted by our advanced culture, and\nthose primitive societies shriveled and died. The conclusion of the\nBrookings study was that, if we, indeed, would encounter advanced\nextraterrestrial intelligence, we probably should not tell the\nmasses of people because sociologically, theologically,\nscientifically, it would be a damn disaster.\n\n\nSo,\nthey published that study and it literally\nbecame national policy. It\u2019s one of the major reasons why the\nlid has been kept down so tightly on this thing for so long.\n\n\nAs\nI said, it\u2019s not simply that we are being visited by guys\nfrom other planets. It is not simply that we are being\nvisited by guys from other star systems, nor are we being visited,\nyou know, from other galaxies. Good God! Those are all given.\n\n\n\n\nThey\nalso learned \u2013 and they knew that when I retired in \u201976 \u2013\nthat we are being visited by guys from other dimensions. they are\ncoming through portals, apparently. They create\nportals, apparently, and they are coming and going from other\ndimensions. The more advanced societies we have encountered have been\nmultidimensional.\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nno wonder that our ancestors deified these dudes back 10,000 years\nago. I think there are people today who would deify them, if they\nwere to confront them and see what they can do, and understand where\nthey are from, and what their capabilities are. You would think\nthat it was almost godlike to have that kind of technology.\n\n\nSo,\nover the years I have come to a point where I have almost\nbegun to be patient and tolerate of the government\u2019s lies \u2013\nbut not quite.  Not quite. I am so fed up with\ngovernment lies; I do not even know where to start. [applause/\nwhistles] You too, huh?\n\n\n\nLast\nweek, I was over at the Bay Area conference and a couple of people\nsaid: What have we learned\nin the last year since you were here? \n\n\nI\nsaid: Well, we learned\nthat the American people elected a black President.\n\n\nis not\nthat pretty damned impressive? Who would have ever thought that the\nAmerican people could elect a black President?\n\n\n\nListen,\nguys, I am from the last century; that is dynamite to me. My\nheart goes out to that kid, because he\u2019s likeable, he\u2019s\npersonable, and he\u2019s bright, and I wish him well. I hope to\nhell he can pull it off; he\u2019s got so much -- damn much -- on\nhis plate.\n\n\n\nBut,\nhe ain\u2019t going to disclose this subject any time soon because\nhe\u2019s not ready for this. I do not even think he\u2019s\nbeen briefed yet on what this is all about.\n\n\nYou\nall know the story, what happened to Jimmy Carter, who promised\neverybody that, when he was elected, he was going to release all of\nthe UFO information?\n\n\n\nHe\ngot into Washington and he got his National Security briefing. He\nwalked out his briefing with tears in his eyes. Apparently, the\nDirector of Central Intelligence said: Mr.\nPresident, you do not have a high-enough clearance, Sir, to have\naccess to all this material.\n\n\nNow,\ncan you believe that? The Director of Central Intelligence says:\nAlso, Sir, you do not have a need to know.\n\n\nAnd\npoor old Jimmy just... he wilted, and as a result, he never said Boo\nabout anything during his four years in office. Promises went down\nthe tube.\n\n\nWho\nwas the Director of Central Intelligence? Some guy by the name of\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwe are beginning to put pieces together here. The puzzle is\nbeginning to form here. Who\u2019s sitting on top of this damn\ncover-up?  Oh my.\n\n\n\nNow,\nI want to share something with you here. The guys in Spain asked me\ncontinually: When is there\ngoing to be Disclosure? Good God, you guys, it\u2019s been years and\nyears and years now. We expect the U.S. government to expose this.\nWhen you going to do it? \n\n\nAnd\nI said: Guys, \nhold your breath. It ain\u2019t going to happen any time soon,\nbecause it\u2019s too big a story.\n\n\nAnd\nthen, of course, Greer and Bassett were there at the conference,\nand... Well, let me give you a small parable here. I have got a\nlittle parable I have prepared. It\u2019s called The\nThree Stevens and the Apocalypse.\n\n\n\n\nThat\nsounds religious enough, does not it? \u2013 The\nThree Stevens and the Apocalypse.\n\n\nI\nwant to now touch upon that word, apocalypse,\nbecause that\u2019s another word that ticks me off. I am so pissed\noff at the number of people who misuse that word.\n\n\n\nMost\nof my fundamentalist friends \u2013 and I have a few, still, yet,\nafter all these years \u2013 keep talking about the Four Horsemen of\nthe Apocalypse. Oh my God.\nwe are doomed, you\nknow. War, Famine, Plague,\nPestilence \u2013 the Four Horsemen are riding. \n\n\nFor\nGod\u2019s sake! The Four Horsemen have been riding for 10,000 damn\nyears!  But, most of them never really grasp the meaning of\nthe word apocalypse.\nIt\u2019s a Greek word and it has several meanings: the\nrevealing, the uncovering, and the disclosing.\nOf what? The truth.\n\n\n\nAnd\nyou are living in the middle of the apocalypse. you have\nbeen living in it for the last 10 to 20 years and you are going\nto be living in it for another 20 or 30 years. The revealing, the\nuncovering, and the disclosing is taking place as you sit here and as\nyou breathe. It is taking place now.\n\n\nBut,\nI got into this little tangle with Greer and Bassett. I respect them\nboth. they are decent guys. I have known Steven Greer for\nyears.\n\n\n\nThey\nkeep hammering away. They have these conferences in Washington and\nthey keep prodding the congress and they keep prodding the\ngovernment: you have\ngot to have a committee, you have got to reveal this material,\nyou have got to tell the American people the truth,\nblah-blah-blah.\n\n\nAnd\nthe government... pardon me, but they give them that middle finger,\nyou know? In the air? Excuse me, ladies, I am sorry. That\u2019s\nrather rude, but the government does that to Greer and Bassett, and\nthey go back and they say: Well,\nmaybe next week, maybe next month. Oh, a new administration. Oh,\nwe have got Podesta,\nwho worked for Clinton. we have got Panetta,\nwho worked for Clinton, and we have got a young President, who I\nbelieve, is honest and transparent and is going to tell us the truth.\n\n\nI\nsaid to Bassett and Greer: do not\nhold your breath, guys. It ain\u2019t going to happen. That new\nPresident ain\u2019t going to put that on his plate, not if he can\navoid it, because he\u2019s not going to get the whole story right\nnow. He\u2019s got so damn much piled up outside of his Oval Office,\nhe can hardly get in and out of it...\nand you all know the story on that.\n\n\nNow,\nwho\u2019s the other Steven? Ah! A young man in Hollywood \u2013\nSpielberg. Now, where does he fit into this thing?\n\n\n\nWell,\nwhen I was asked about Disclosure: Is\nit going to happen? and I\nsay: No/ yes, yes/ no, no/\nyes. And everybody\u2019s\nsaying: What the hell\u2019s\nhe talking about?\n\n\nDisclosure\nhas been under way for some time. Steven Spielberg made a bunch of\nmovies. He made E.T.,\nwhich, I think, most\nof you have probably seen. That was for the kids.\n\n\n\nHe\nmade another one called Close\nEncounters of the Third Kind,\nand that was for the big guys. And then he made a television series\ncalled Taken,\nwhich was dynamite.\n\n\nThey\ntell me -- and I have got this from sources that I trust -- that\nhe\u2019s got two separate programs in the mill: another movie, and\nperhaps, another TV series that he\u2019s working on that they are\ngoing to come up with, hopefully in the next few years.\n\n\nNow,\nthese movies, as they come out, affect people. There\u2019s not a\none of you here in the audience that was not, you know, affected\nby E.T.\nIt was cute; it was a kid\u2019s story, really. And I think there\u2019s\nnot a one of you who was not touched at the closing scene of\nClose Encounters of the\nThird Kind, when the guys\npiled aboard that ship and off it went.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthen Taken,\nwhich I think, ran for a number of weeks. I cannot remember how\nmany episodes it was.\n\n\n\nVOICE\nFROM AUDIENCE:  Twenty.\n\n\n\nBOB:\n Twenty? Good God, yes. Well that\u2019s a major program. It was\npowerful, well written, and dynamite. It had so much classified\nmaterial in it... but most people, I do not think, ever realized\nthat they were looking at classified material.\n\n\nThen\nthere was another guy out in Hollywood who I got to know. A number of\nyears ago, I was honored to be invited to be a speaker at the Mensa\nRegional Conference in Orange County. I was honored to be invited and\nI went and spoke to the Mensa\ncrowd.\n\n\n\nThe\nguest of honor at that particular regional conference was a dude by\nthe name of Chris Carter. He was the producer/director of the\nX-Files,\nas most of you know.\n\n\n\nAfter\npresentations and all, and drinks, you know, I got him aside and\nwe are standing there sipping away \u2013 fruit juice, of\ncourse.  I pulled him over and I says: Chris,\nyou got to level with me.\n\n\nI\nsays: I have been\nwatching your program here now for some time.\n\u2013 I think it had been underway for about six years at that time\n\u2013 and I said: It\u2019s\nimpressive. Some of your stories are dynamite, some of your stories\naren\u2019t worth the powder to blow them away, but it\u2019s a\npretty decent series.\n\nBut,\nI says,\nI\nwant to ask you something. There are three incidents, three episodes\nof your X-Files that I happen to know are highly classified\ngovernment secrets. \n\n\nI have\nbeen on the inside, I knew these things to be classified and here\nthey are. I am seeing them on the X-Files, for\nGod\u2019s sake. \n\n\nAnd\nI says: How the hell do\nyou guys do that?\n\n\nHe\nsays: Oh, I have got\nsome great writers.\n\n\nAnd\nI said: Bullshit.\nNonsense. Poppycock, you\nknow. What is it my good old British ancestors...? Balderdash.\n\n\n\n\nI\nsaid: You cannot tell\nme that your writers have come up with classified material that\nthey have dramatized that are right on and are still classified.\n\n\nHe\nlooked around and he got a sheepish grin on his face and he says:\nWell, yeah, we have\nbeen getting some story ideas from a variety of sources.\n\n\nI\nsays: Where?\n\n\nHe\nsays: Well, you know, I\ncannot really say, but we have been getting some promotional\nideas from different people.\n\n\nI\nsaid: Well, you are\nright on, and I laid them\nout for him, these three particular cases that were classified and\nstill are classified.\n\n\n\nAnd\nall he did, he looked at me sheepishly and he grinned and he says:\nYou ain\u2019t seen\nnothing yet. Stay tuned.\nAnd it ran for another two years.\n\n\nBut\nthere, again, is what I wanted to point out to you is what Spielberg\nwas involved in, what Chris Carter is involved in, and what some of\nthe directors and writers of the Stargate\nseries and the Star Trek\nseries...\n\n\n\nIn,\nfrom time to time, little bits and pieces of material are injected\ninto those story lines that are not fiction. they are not\nscience fiction,\nthey are science fact.\nBut, they are introduced in such a way that you do not know\nit \u2013 you do not recognize it. It hits you at what\u2019s\nknown as the subliminal\nlevel.\n\n\n\nWhen\nI tell you that Disclosure ain\u2019t going to happen, then I tell\nyou that Disclosure is happening now, I am referring to that\nsubliminal educational program that is underway that you are all\nbeing subjected to. you are getting the uncovering and the\nrevealing and the Disclosure in subtle ways that you do not even\nrecognize.\n\n\nAnd\nyou are going to get more of it because the program, apparently,\nis rather successful and the guys who put it together are rather\npleased at your responses. you are going to be getting more\nstories, and you are going to get some stories that are so far\nout, you are going to say to yourself: Good\nGod, that could not happen.\nBut good God! \u2013 it is\nhappening.\n\n\n\nBen\nRich, before he retired from Lockheed Martin, made some comments to a\nnumber of people there, California. -- we are in\nCalifornia -- forgive me, I am from Arizona. I baked my gourd in\nPhoenix for the last six to eight months and I lose it sometimes.\n\n\n\nThis\nprogram is underway. It\u2019s subtle; it\u2019s continuous; and it\nis subliminal education; it\u2019s affecting you -- it\u2019s\naffecting everybody and you are going to see more of it.\n\n\n\nThey\ndid it in the Stargate\nseries. They did it in Star\nTrek \u2013 Kirk, Jean\nLuke Piccard and the rest of them from the Enterprise.\nThey slip little bits and pieces in from time to time where you\nthink: Ooo, is not\nthat exciting? is not that way out?\n\n\nGuys,\nit\u2019s not that way out. Ben Rich said, before he retired -- he\nsays: we are 100\nyears ahead of establishment science.\n\n\nThis\nis a guy who had a right to know and he had a need to know and he was\nin the inside of the program. we are\n100 years ahead of establishment science\n\u2013 the stuff that normally is understood by guys in\nuniversities, you know, on the street... Rich says we are 100\nyears beyond that.\n\n\n\nAnd\nhe said: You know,\nwe could take E.T. home.\nNow, the movie was out at about that time, and you know the story.\nThe little dude says: E.T.\ngo home, E.T. wants to go home.\nRich says: We can take\nE.T. home.\n\n\nNow,\nBen Rich has been dead for ten years, for God\u2019s sake!\n\n\nI\nknew another Lockheed Martin scientist who has passed away, a guy by\nthe name of David Froning who worked with Lockheed Martin for almost\n30 years. I invited David to speak at a conference in Phoenix some\nyears back. Wendelle Stevens\nand I put on a program and we got hold of Froning.\n\n\n\nWe\nknew he was brilliant and we knew he\u2019d been on the inside of\nresearch at Lockheed Martin for so long. We got David to come down\nand speak at our conference there in Phoenix, and he was getting up\nin years \u2013 David\u2019s gone Home now. He was getting up in\nyears and he shared some things with us.\n\n\n\nFroning\nsaid: You know, Bob,\nhe said, I have been\nretired now for 10 years.\nHe says: Before I retired,\nI was in the Advanced Systems Division of Lockheed Martin and we were\ndealing with something we called modified field propulsion\n\u2013 variable field,\nhe said.\n\n\n\nOf\ncourse, he began to lose me immediately; I did not know what he\nwas talking about. Matter/\nantimatter conversion. Exotic field tension. Wormholes.\n\n\nHe\nsaid: It will modify time\nand space, and he says:\nWe have had transluminal\nflight for over 30 years.\n\n\nAnd\nI had to stop again, and I says: Hold\nit. Transluminal, hyperluminal, flight?\nI says: you are\ntalking about faster-than-light, for gosh sakes.\n\n\nHe\nsaid: Yeah, we have\nhad it now for 30 years.\nNow this was from David Froning who\u2019d spent the biggest chunk\nof his life as an advanced systems engineer for Lockheed Martin.\n\n\nThen\nwe get the material from Ben Rich, and somebody said to Rich, he\nsaid: Man, what the hell\nare you really talking about?\n\n\nHe\ngoes to the blackboard \u2013 his\nbig\n\nfor\nretirement, I think, was one of the major hangars over there\n\u2013\nhe goes up and he writes: UnFunded\nOpportunities.\n\n\nI\nsay: What the hell are you\ntalking about?\n\n\nHe\ntakes the chalk and he circles U, F, and O, and then he left the\nstage and walked out the door, and they are all thinking: Good\nGod! What? This man\u2019s lost it here.\nUnFunded\nOpportunities, U-F-O?\n\n\nWhat\nhe was inferring and saying literally in their face: Yes,\nwe have reverse-engineered technology from alien craft. And we are\nflying it and it works! We can take E.T. home!\n\n\nNow,\none of the reasons I get so ticked off... You have to forgive me\nhere, I am getting old. I do not have the patience I used\nto have.\n\n\n\nThe\nrumor has been going around that I have turned out to be a mean,\nrotten old fart.  Cynical, you know? Grumpy. Well, that\u2019s\nnot entirely true. I like to think, as Henry Higgens said, that I\nhave the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein!\n\n\n\nBut,\nI cannot really pull it off. I guess I am getting kind of grumpy\nin my old age.\n\n\n\nGuys,\nI am getting angry. I really am getting angrier every day when I\nthink about the con job that\u2019s being pulled on you and\n300-million other Americans on a daily basis, where they are\nliterally conning you to the point they are taking you to the\ncleaners. they are stealing you blind and then they are\nlying to you about it.\n\n\n\nI\nhave a list of... I call it my Pissed-Off List.  You know,\nwhen you are old and you are sitting in retirement, you\nhave to spend your time doing something,  so I prepared\nthis list.\n\n\nTop\nof the list are politicians.  And I say, repeatedly, that\nyou guys have the best congress money can buy. That bunch of clowns\nin Washington who think of themselves, call themselves, congress \u2013\nthat we should build special prisons for them.\n\n\n\nI am\nserious.  I think about half of them should be put up in\nfront of a judge and sent off for ten years, because they are a\nbunch of damn thieves. \n\n\n\nNot\nonly are they molesting children... and what the hell, the Governor\nof North Carolina? South Carolina? \u2013 Big scandal \u2013 his\nlove affair is in Argentina. The hell with his wife and kids; his\nlove affair is in Argentina.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthen we have got congressmen who are guilty of the same thing.\nSome of them are gay; and I am not putting them down because\nthey are gay. I am putting them down because they lie about\nit.\n\n\n\nAs\nI say, guys, we have got a mess of clowns back there. What was it\nthat Will\nRogers said?\nThe most permanent,\nongoing, self-continuing program in the world of liars and cheats is\nthe United States Congress\n\u2013 and Will\u2019s been gone for a long, long time.\n\n\n\nSo,\nI get my dander up. I vent my spleen when I come and talk to guys\nlike you, and I will say this to you: That the next election for\ncongress and the next one for the President, think carefully about\nwhat clowns you want to send off to Washington. I mean examine them\ncarefully, because they are supposed to represent you and\nthey are not doing a very good job of it.\n\n\nOkay,\nexcuse me. I do have tendency to ramble a bit, because I have got\nso damn much to cover. .\n\n\nOh\nyes, one of the top of my lists is NASA. You know that crowd? Never\na Straight Answer?\n \u2013 NASA.\n\n\n\nThis\nNewsweek\ncame out a couple of weeks back. I am sure most of you may have\nseen it. This is a shameful issue. This is a shameful article.\nIn Search of Aliens, it\nsays, and then it says: NASA\nis out there looking.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwhile I was in Spain, the Spaniards asked me \u2013 You know, just\nas I was going over there, we were celebrating 40 years of Apollo 11:\nGee that was something,\nwas not it? We put a couple of guys on the Moon. we are\npatting ourselves on the back, and we are tooting our little\nhorns: was not that\ngreat? was not that cool? were not we special?\n\n\nAnd\nI had to say to some of my Spanish friends over there: You\ncould never trust this damn bunch over at NASA. They did go to the\nMoon, but that was only half the story. The story was what they found\nwhen they got there, and the story was what the photographs had\ntaken.\n\n\nNow,\nyou probably know this, but in case you do not, I\u2019ll tell\nyou again. NASA admitted about two years ago, I think about two years\nback, that they had \u201cinadvertently\u201d erased 40 rolls of\nfilm from the Apollo program. That release went out over the media\nand Congress did not say a word \u2013 no peep, no poop,\nnothing. The media itself, they reported it and pffft! \u2013 off\ninto the wind.\n\n\n\nNASA\nsays: We inadvertently,\nmistakenly \u2013 gee, we are sorry \u2013 we erased 40 rolls\nof film from the Apollo program.\n\n\nNow,\nwe are talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of individual\nphotographs in those 40 rolls. They erased them.\n\n\n\nWhy?\nBecause they showed what they ran into on the Moon. They showed what\nthey ran into on the way to the Moon. They showed what they ran into\nwhen they got there. This\nhas got to go! We cannot let that out!\n\n\nBut\nsome nitwit in NASA had forgotten that NASA had given a contract to\nthe Japanese Space Agency back in the \u201960s, probably involving\nbig bucks, where the Japanese \u2013 sharp bunch of guys over there\n\u2013 bought every negative or every shot of every picture taken by\nthe entire Apollo program and they have got it in their computers\nin Japan.\n\n\n\nAnd\nNASA evidently forgot that. \n\n\n\nNow,\nlisten, you have to understand something. There are damn fine guys in\nNASA. There are good scientists; there are some fine people working\nthere. I am not putting them down; I take my hat off to them and\nI respect them.\n\n\nThe\nones that I am really pissed off at are the administrators, the\npolicy makers, the politicians. They forgot\nthat they had sold all this to Japan.\n\n\nLo\nand behold, I am at a conference in Tokyo. I was a guest of\nJunichi\nYaoi,\none of the foremost\nJapanese researchers and UFO experts. I was on national television in\nJapan.\n\n\n\nWhile\nI was there, I was provided some photographs taken by NASA and the\nApollo program that the Japanese Space Agency has been sitting on top\nof for a long, long time. And I am about to show you a couple\nright now.\n\n\n[shouts/\nhoots/ whistles/ applause]\n\n\n[reading\ntransparency] Okay, this is negative nine. This is Apollo Systems\nA-13, yeah, Apollo Systems 13. Bear with me while I get this thing up\nthere. \n\n\nOkay.\nThis\nphotograph was\ntaken by Apollo 13. Now, you may remember Apollo 13. It was the one\nthat never made it to the Moon. They had a tiny explosion on the way,\nwhere an oxygen tank blew up and they were barely able to get to the\nMoon, go around, and barely able to get home.\n\n\n\nBut\nthey were not alone on that trip. So, while they were out and away,\ngoing and coming, they had little windows and they snapped pictures.\n\n\n\nThis\nis one picture that was held by the Japanese Space Agency. You can\nsee the Japanese writing here.\n\n\n\nAnyhow,\nthis is the Moon, upper left. These two objects here, B and C, are\nfairly large circular disks of some kind. But over here \u2013 \u201cA\u201d\n\u2013 which is moving into the scene \u2013 here is the positive\nand here is the negative. I hope you can all see that.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a circular disk with a dome. Here\u2019s the Moon, another\ndisk, but this dude is coming into the picture , and\nhere we are. Here\u2019s the photo and here\u2019s the negative\ndown here. This object is five\nmiles long.\n\n\n\nSo,\nyou wonder why NASA is keeping its mouth shut? How can they talk\nabout something like that? How can they release something like that\nto you? An object we encountered on the way to the Moon that\u2019s\nfive miles long!\n\n\nNow,\njust give some thought. Try to consider a technology, a culture, a\ncivilization that can not only build something like that, put it in\nspace, put it in orbit around the Earth, but staff it and man it\nwith... how many?\n\n\n\nI\nhad the pleasure of being on a couple of aircraft carriers. My son is\na career Naval officer, spent 14 years on aircraft carriers,\nNimitz-class,\natomic-powered carriers.\n\n\n\nFor\nthose of you who do not know, they are impressive. they are\n1,000 feet long. They have a crew complement of 5,000 men! These big\nnuclear Nimitz-class\ncarriers have 5,000 guys in their crew! they are massive.\nthey are gigantic. they are unbelievable.\n\n\nNow,\nwe were joking one day about it, Eric and I \u2013 my son \u2013\nwhat kind of a crew would this dude have with, you know, five miles?\nWhat are they doing over there? What is their pastime? What is their\nfunction? What is their purpose?\n\n\n\nAnd,\nhaving been on a Nimitz\ncarrier a couple of times, you know, they are very impressive \u2013\nsoda fountains, snack bars and all the rest of it to make the guys\ncomfortable and all. I anticipated \u2013 I have assumed \u2013\nthat aboard an object out there, five miles long, you\u2019d have\nbowling alleys, restaurants, theaters,  you know, all kinds\nof entertainment. Because we have learned over the years that if\nyou are an alien and you are involved in human beings, you need\nentertainment! \n\n\nSo,\nthey probably have saunas aboard, you know. And probably the most\nfavorite pastime, I would think, is watching human television. Think\nfor a moment, having watched it yourself,  and all the\nidiotic crap that goes-on on TV, and imagine what a bunch of guys\nfrom another star system are thinking.\n\n\n\nthey are\nrolling in the aisles, probably, laughing about these unbelievable\nmonkeys down there.  they are watching our stories \u2013\nDancing with the Stars?\n\u2013 and they are supposed to think of us as being intelligent,\nand advanced, and sophisticated? Oh, my! \n\n\nOkay.\nThis is the first shot. \nHere is the second one. This\nis negative 10.\n\n\n\n\nNow,\nthat big dude has moved over into the middle of the frame and another\nobject has showed up over here; was estimated at being two miles\nlong, but this one, five miles. Here is the print and here is the\nnegative.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nthe same object, but it seems to have moved somewhat. we are not\ngetting a full side-view like we did in the other picture, we are\ngetting it a little elongated, and there are a couple of circular\ndisk-like objects here.\n\n\n\nApparently\nit\u2019s like a carrier. It puts its aircraft out and brings them\nback. It\u2019s probably a carrier for disks, alien disks that we\nfind in our skies all the time.\n\n\nBut\nagain, when you start considering the magnitude of the size and the\nimplications of what it means, then you can almost sympathize with\nthe authorities about: We\ncannot tell those people these things. No, no, no. they are\nnot ready for it. \n\n\nNo,\nno, no, hell! They\nwere not ready for it! they are the ones that were scared\nto death. You guys can probably handle it, but they cannot?\n\n\n\n[shows\nnext photo] Ah! That was only the beginning of the story. Over the\nyears I have been fortunate in that I have been lucky in finding\nsmart people in the most unlikely places.\n\n\n\nI am\nspeaking at a conference at the Bay Area a number of years ago and a\nlittle dude shows up by the name of Norman\nBergrun.\nNorman retired\nfrom NASA after almost 30 years. He was an engineer and a\nphotographic expert, and he and a number of others were responsible\nin putting together what they called the Voyager\nProgram.\n\n\n\nIn\nthe late \u201970s, astronomers and guys in NASA had discovered some\nanomalous things happening in the rings of Saturn.\n\n\n\nI\nlove that word anomalous.\nThings were happening, but they did not know what the hell they\nwere. They did not know how to explain it. So, what they did,\nthey put together a multimillion dollar program called Voyager,\nand they sent Voyager\nto the rings of Saturn in 1980.\n\n\n\nWhen\nVoyager One\ngot in the rings of Saturn, it began taking pictures. The pictures\nwere sent back to NASA, and they were astounded \u2013 literally\nastounded. They got stuff they did not expect.\n\n\nNow,\nbefore I go into detail about these photos, I will tell you that\nNorman Bergrun, a little dude about five feet tall, you know, pink\ncheeks, little bow tie, brilliant as hell. Last year, when I saw him\nat the Bay Area, he was 87.\n\n\n\nI\nhave been unable to reach him. I have tried through the phones,\nmy wife tried with the computer \u2013 cannot reach Norman. I\ndo not know whether he\u2019s passed over and gone Home, or\nwhat happened.\n\n\n\nAll\nI know is that last year in the Bay Area, I introduced him and they\nmobbed him. The little dude had a box of books, and after I\nintroduced him he got mobbed, and he sold every book he had at $50\nbucks a pop.\n\n\nBut\nNorman was what I say: There are some good folks in NASA, honest men\nwho would like to tell you everything they have learned and\neverything they know.\n\n\nSo,\nanyhow, Norman: After frustration, and time passed, in 1986, Norman\ndecided to blow the whistle and publish the photographs that the\nVoyager One\ntook in the rings of Saturn.\n\n\n\nHe\ncould not get his book published in the United States. Wonder\nwhy?! US publishers would not touch him, would not even\ntalk to him. The little dude had to go to Aberdeen, Scotland, to get\nhis book published and  that\u2019s the\ncover of his book.\n[Ed. note: titled Ringmakers\nof Saturn]\n\n\nIt\nmay be available; you maybe can find a copy if you try here, there,\nor wherever. I hate to tell you what they might cost now, because\nthey are real collector\u2019s items.\n\n\nBut,\nI was delighted that I was able to discover him and present him to\nthe conference in the Bay Area last year. The response from the\naudience was overwhelming. His little face lit up and he gave me a\nbig hug, tears in his eyes. But he published his book in Aberdeen,\nScotland, and it is a dynamite book.\n\n\n[pointing\nto overhead photo] Now, on the cover, this you see here on the right\nis part of the B Ring of Saturn. You know, there are A, B, C, a whole\nbunch of rings; gigantic. Saturn\u2019s a giant planet and these\nrings are incredible.\n\n\n\nThis\nthing here [indicating close-up\nof the orange dot\non the book cover]: self-luminous, obviously artificial construction,\nobviously under intelligent control, because it moves around in the\nrings of Saturn. They do not know what the hell it is, but it\u2019s\nlarger than our Moon \u2013 an intelligent, constructed, artificial\nobject larger than our Moon moving around throughout the rings of\nSaturn wherever it will go.\n\n\n\nWe\nget a picture of it and we do not know what to say, we do not\nknow what to do, we do not know how to respond. Bigger than our\nMoon! Ah, that\u2019s only part of the story.\n\n\n[changes\nphoto] Here we go. This\nis in the A Ring\nand the statistics on this will blow your mind. This object here is\nan artificially-constructed , as Norman says; NASA\ncalled it an electromagnetic\nvehicle. That dude is\n2,000 miles long,\nover 450 miles in diameter. But 2,000 miles long!\n\n\n\nAnd\nhere\u2019s another self-luminous artificial object [zooms in on the\nlarge dot; same photo], about the size of our Moon, that apparently\nmoves here, there, and everywhere, wherever it will go, obviously\nunder intelligent control.\n\n\n\nBut,\nconsider this thing. Consider the civilization, the technology \nthe culture that can not only build something like that, but put it\nin space, move it here and there, wherever they will, for whatever\npurpose.\n\n\n\nNorman\nsays he thought they were making the rings, which is why he titled\nhis book The Ringmakers.\n\n\nI\nsaid: Norman, did you ever\nstop to think that they might be mining the rings?\nwe have concluded from several missions \u2013 Voyager\nOne was only the first of\na whole bunch of them \u2013 that the rings are made up of minerals\nfrom perhaps God knows how many eons back when the planets were being\nformed.\n\n\n\nAnd\nI said: Stop to think\nabout an advanced technology. They could mine those rings, and those\nminerals are gold mines, you know? Talk about nutrients! you have\ngot all that good stuff.\n\n\nAnd\nhe says: You know, I\ndid not think about that, that they might be mining them.\n\n\nGod,\nI wish I knew what happened to Norman. I lost track of him. But, his\nbook is a monument to the fact that there are some decent men in NASA\nwho want the truth told.\n\n\nNow,\nI want to ask for a show of hands. How many of you are overwhelmed\nand shocked at these facts about those objects out there? Oh, a few!\nOverwhelmed and shocked! Well, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s good.\n\n\n\nI\nwas overwhelmed and shocked the first time I saw it and the first\ntime I began to put it together, and considered what it meant.\nBecause there we are getting to the important thing here: What\ndoes this mean?\n\n\nNow,\nI assume most of you are aware and familiar with a brilliant\neducator, a physicist in New York by the name of Michio\nKaku,\nbrilliant young man, a\nquantum physicist, theoretical physicist. Michio has come up with\nwhat he considers to be a possibility of four different kinds of\nadvanced civilizations: Type I, II, III and IV.\n\n\n\nYou,\nby the way, are members of the Zero-Zero Type civilization.\n Not that you did not know that, but you have not\nquite reached Type I yet.\n\n\n\nThe\nconclusion many of us have reached is that we are looking at the\nresults of at least a Type II civilization. [referring to the photo\nagain]\n\n\nNow,\nhow do these guys out there look upon us? Really, how do you think\nthey think of us?\n\n\n\nI\nhave a pretty good idea because I have been getting some\nlegitimate information from American military and scientific people,\nwho have not only met some of them from out there, but are working\nalongside of them in United States government national laboratories\nlike Sandia, Los Alamos, Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long\nIsland, which is one of the most super-secret laboratories.\n\n\n\nAnyhow,\nwe have scientists and military guys that have been working alongside\nof some of those dudes, and they are in our midst.\n\n\nWhen\nI retired, we knew of four different groups. They were all humanoid,\nbut they were all not the kind of guys who could walk up and down the\nstreet on a Saturday afternoon without being seen or responded to.\n\n\n\nBut,\none of the groups of four looks exactly\nlike us in the sense that it could be sitting here in this auditorium\nnext to you and you would not know it; next to you in an\nairplane or a restaurant or a theater...\n\n\n\nthey are\nin our midst, guys. This one group, particularly, is in our midst,\nand apparently since 1954, when Ike met them at Muroc Air Force Base\nin California; they are been working with us, trying to help us\nmake that transition from adolescence into adulthood.\n\n\nAnd\nwhy are they doing that? Well, apparently, this is the same group\nthat had a hand in engineering our genetics 10,000, 100,000 years\nago.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou want a little history on that subject, read Zecharia Sitchin,\nwhich I suspect most of you are familiar with. His stories are\nshockingly accurate in that they literally tell the essential story\nof our beginnings. They translate these ancient cuneiform tablets\nfrom Sumer.\n\n\n\nZecharia\u2019s\nnot the only one. There was a brilliant Englishman by the name of\nChristian\nO\u2019Brien, who\nwent Home a year or so ago. Christian O\u2019Brien wrote a\nbeautiful, unbelievable and powerful book called The\nGenius of the Few. If you\ncan ever find that somewhere, get a copy.\n\n\n\nChristian\nO\u2019Brien said essentially the same thing Zecharia has said: We\nwere genetically engineered and they have been coming and going,\nand they have been in our midst for a hell of a long time.\n\n\nSomebody\nsaid to Sitchin one time: Zecharia,\nwhen are they coming back?\nAnd he said: Whatever made\nyou think they ever left?\n\n\nAnd\nI do not think they did ever leave.\n\n\nNow,\nagain, this is, I think, a little shocking information here. At least\nit shocked the hell out of me.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwhen I was in Germany at a conference some years ago, a Russian\ncosmonaut by the name of Marina\nPopovich handed out a\nfew copies to me and to Michael\nHesemann, another\nresearcher, friend of mine, that the Soviet Phobos\nmission took on Mars when it was out there 15, 20 years ago.\n\n\n\nThe\nSoviets sent this fantastic mission to Mars. They named it Phobos\n2 because Phobos\n1 is one of the moons of\nMars, twelve miles in diameter, so they named their space mission\nPhobos 2\nand they took a whole bunch of pictures. \n\n\nOne\nof the pictures they took, which Michael Hesemann published in his\nmagazine, is apparently a city the size of Chicago under the surface\nin Mars, generating an enormous amount of heat, because this\nphoto was taken in the infrared.\nIt\u2019s in German at the bottom here, but Michael had published it\nin his magazine.\n\n\nFrom\nPhobos 2\n\u2013 a city under the surface of Mars the size of Chicago. You can\nsee practically the blocks, the streets, and so on. So yes, Virginia,\nthere are Martians, and, yes, they are on Mars. And some of them are\nprobably here, because we apparently do not look that different\nfrom each other.\n\n\n\nBut,\nyou\u2019ll never see this published in an American newspaper or an\nAmerican magazine. It had to be published in Germany by Michael\nHesemann.\n\n\n[next\nphoto] Phobos 2\ntook another picture while it was in orbit around Mars \u2013 and\nthe story I was told was that they literally planned to land on\nPhobos, the moon. Well, they never got there, because while they were\nin orbit around Mars, this thing came up from the surface of Mars \u2013\ngigantic in size \u2013 and apparently bumped Phobos\n2  to knock it out of\norbit and down it went.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthere\u2019s somebody up there who says:\nNo, no, no! You can come and peek, but then you cannot stay very\nlong and you are not going to take that many pictures. we are\nnot going to allow it. \n\n\n\nOkay. I think that does my photographs for you this afternoon.\n\n\n\nNow,\nas I said to you, I am ticked off. I have this Pissed-Off\nRoster, which is a work of joy and pleasure for me.  As I\nsaid, politicians at the top, particularly the United States\nCongress. they are a bunch of clowns. They literally run a\ncircus back there.\n\n\n\nTheologians\nare right next, below.  Forgive me, I am not\nanti-religious; I simply do not like religion because it tends\nto divide people. It separates people.  My\nGod is better than your God. My book is better than your book. My\nstory is truer than your story,\nand so on and so on and so on.\n\n\n\nSo,\nI am not religious at all. I have studied them all. I have\nstudied Hinduism, I have studied Islam  I have studied\nJudaism.\n\n\n\nI\nwas raised a Christian; I have studied Christianity. I consider\nthe young man from Galilee my best friend, but that\u2019s another\nstory that I do not think we have time for me to get into. I\nwent through a series of hypnotic past-life regressions a number of\nyears ago and one of the lives that I discovered was in Galilee 2,000\nyears ago with Him.\nSo, I say he was\nmy best friend and he still is my best friend.\n\n\nAnyhow,\nI am not anti-religious. I respect the people, who are sincere\nand honest about it, but it does tend to separate people \u2013 it\ndivides people \u2013 and I try to promote the concept of a\nspiritual\napproach to life. \n\n\n\nIf\nyou human beings had the slightest idea of what you are!\nMy God, you are incredible! You are, all of you, masterpieces.\n\n\n\nYou\nreally need to know what Yogananda said -- you need to reach a state\nof self-realization; when you recognize that, within you burns a\nspark of pure Divinity, and it do not matter what church you go\nto, or what language you speak, or what politics you are, or what\ncolor your skin might be -- that do not matter.\n\n\n\nYou\nare Divinity in itself. You are part of that Infinite Spark, which my\nfriend from Galilee said: The\nkingdom of Heaven is within you.\n\n\nThe\ngang back there did not really grasp what he was talking about,\nbut his truths and his words are as legitimate today as they ever\nwere. And you guys are getting there; you are beginning to pay\nattention, you are beginning to wake up.\n\n\n\nNow,\nas I said, my Pissed Off List goes down, you know. We had NASA, the\npoliticians, the theologians, and then there\u2019s the American\nmass of people: the public. What is it they used to call it? The\ngreat unwashed? You know, Joe Six-pack?\n\n\n\nListen,\nI have to be kind with Joe, because at the moment, bless his heart,\nhe may have lost his job, he may be losing his home, he cannot\npay his bills, he\u2019s got kids to send through school and educate\nand buy clothes for. So, I am trying to be gentle with Joe\nSix-pack, because he\u2019s carrying a heavy load right now.\n\n\n\nThere\nare tens of thousands of them out there, all over the country. There\nmay be some of them in the audience here tonight and you probably\nknow a few of them, and they are damn-fine people. So, I am\nnot trying to fault them too much \u2013 the fact that they are\nnot paying attention.\n\n\nI\nget a little ticked off \u2013 NASCAR! Basketball! Football! Tennis!\nGolf! My God, these fixations with these little balls! You know?\n Freud would have a ball with that, you know, no\npun intended. Old Sigmund would have a real fine time working that\nout.\n\n\nOkay,\nforgive me for wandering. It\u2019s important that I get some of\nthis stuff...\n\n\n\nOne\nof the things that I fault the average guy out there is for his\nattention span. He seems to be suffering \u2013 the masses of them \u2013\nseem to be suffering what they call Attention Deficit Disorder. It\u2019s\na problem the kids in school have. They cannot seem to focus on\nanything more than two or three minutes and then they are pfft\n-- off somewhere else; pfft -- off somewhere else.\n\n\n\nI\nblame television for that, as well as their parents for allowing them\nto do that. How many of them sit down and read a book these days?\n\n\n\nAnyhow,\ntheir attention span is very, very limited. The public at large has a\nlimited attention span.\n\n\n\nFor\nexample, let me get back here, go back a few years. [checking his\nnotes] Ah! Wernher von Braun said in 1959 \u2013 now get the year,\n\u201959, five years after \u201954.\n\n\nNow,\nwhat the hell happened in \u201954? Well, something unusual happened\nat Muroc Air Force Base in California in \u201954, where an aging\nPresident had an encounter that literally damn near killed him --\nbecause right after this event in \u201954 at Muroc, the poor old\ndude had a heart attack. He was not able to deal with this thing. [Ed\nnote: Muroc AFB has been renamed as Edwards AFB.]\n\n\nAnyhow,\nin 1959, a famous Nazi by the name of Wernher von Braun, who\nliterally built our Saturn Five program from the ground up, had this\nto say, and this appeared in several US newspapers \u2013 I kid you\nnot -- this was published in newspapers.\n\n\n\nWernher\nsaid in \u201959: We find\nourselves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hitherto\nassumed and whose base is at present unknown to us. I cannot say more\nat present. We are now engaged in entering into closer contact with\nthose powers.\n\n\nNow,\nwould not you have thought that Wernher would have been mobbed?\nExplain this! What the\nhell are you talking about? Who are these powers that you are\nreferring to? I mean, you are one of our top scientists; you are\nbuilding the Apollo program for us.\n\n\nThis\nis in \u201959! No major response. Like whhttt! \u2013 it just went\nover. \n\n\nAh,\n1980. Another German professor by the name of Hermann\nOberth\nsaid this, and this\nwas quoted and published in several American newspapers: We\ncannot take the credit for our record advancement in certain\nscientific fields alone; we have been helped by the peoples of other\nworlds.\n\n\nNow,\ndid this cause a ripple? Did people say: What\nthe hell are you talking about, professor?\n\u201cPeople of other\nworlds?\u201d What? It\ncries out for answers and there were not any and nobody made a\ndeal out of it.\n\n\nAnd\nthen, here we have something in 1987 \u2013 a prominent American\nsenator from Hawaii, Daniel K. Inouye; United States Senator from\nHawaii. He said this in a committee and it\u2019s in the\nCongressional Record: There\nexists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, and\nits own fund-raising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own\nideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances and\nfree from the law itself.\n\u2013 And this is in the Congressional Record.\n\n\n\nDid\nthat cause a response? Did people mob the senator and say: Senator,\nwhat the hell are you talking about? This is dynamite.\n\n\nAttention\nDeficit Disorder!\n\n\nAllen\nHynek said before he died... A series of events occurred in New York\nalong the Hudson River some years ago, called the Hudson\nRiver Events, where\ngigantic triangular and boomerang-shaped objects a mile, and a\nmile-and-a-half across, hovered over the Hudson River, moved slowly\nup and down the Taconic Freeway there \u2013 hundreds of people\ngoing up and down, guys pulling off the road, looking up and seeing\nthis damn thing.\n\n\n\nIt\nwas gigantic. It hovered over the Indian Point nuclear reactor for an\nhour. All the alarms went off, all of the security people responded\nto this thing \u2013 and it took place \u2013 and not one word from\nthe authorities about this, except some stupid-ass idea of a\nbunch of guys were flying little planes around at night in formation.\n\n\n\nThe\nFAA, to its eternal shame, said things like that: Oh,\nthese guys were flying around in their little airplanes, you know, in\nformation at night \u2013\nnever mentioning that this was total violation of FAA regulations. As\nif those little guys in little airplanes could match something that\u2019s\na mile-and-a-half across \u2013 a boomerang, a triangle!\n\n\nAttention\nDeficit Disorder! It goes on and on and on.\n\n\nWhere\nam I here?  As I say, I tend to wander.\nForgive me. Okay, I have given you your little parable. I talked\nabout David Froning. I talked about Ben Rich. I have quoted\nInouye, von Braun, Oberth,\nthe shadow government.\n\n\n\nOh,\nI want to touch upon one little other thing here. There\u2019s an\namusing situation that has taken place. I find it amusing and I find\nit tragic.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s\na young Brit by the name of Gary McKinnon. Many of you are familiar\nwith this story. Gary, it seems, is a computer nerd. He\u2019s a\nreal genius. He\u2019s a hacker.\n\n\n\nWell,\nGary happened to be able to hack into the Defense Department\ncomputers here about a year ago, a little over a year now. He hacked\ninto NASA\u2019s computers a little over a year ago, and he come up\nwith some stuff that was dynamite.\n\n\n\nSo,\nwhat happened is that we found about it and we got hold of the Brits\nand we said: We want that\nman. we are going to put him on trial and we are going to stick\nhis ass in jail for 70 years.\n\n\nAnd,\nso help me God, the British agreed to extradite young Gary McKinnon\nto the United States for trial and sentencing. Now, I stand curious\nto see what kind of a trial they plan to put on for McKinnon. It\u2019s\ngot to be a public trial. He\u2019s not a US citizen. they are\ncharging him with a violation of our computer security systems and\nall the rest of it.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthis kid\u2019s being sent from the UK over to the United States and\nthey are going to put his little butt up in front of a judge and\na jury and charge him with damage by breaking into our NASA and our\nDefense Department computers.\n\n\n\nI\nand others have said they should hire the kid, for Christ sake, and\nput him to work.  If he can hack into those computers, he\nmust know what the hell he\u2019s doing.\n\n\nAh,\nbut let me just touch lightly upon what did Gary McKinnon come up\nwith? Ah... what did he download when he hacked into those computers?\n\n\n\n\nHe\napparently downloaded some stuff, packaged up the material, and\nturned it over to a British researcher by the name of Timothy\nGood. Now Tim, for\nmany of you who know of him, he\u2019s probably one of the top\nresearchers on the planet. He\u2019s a brilliant young man. I say\nyoung \u2013 he\u2019s about the age of my son, about 57, maybe\nclose to 60.\n\n\n\nAnyhow,\nTimothy Good, apparently, was the recipient of some of this\ndownloaded material from McKinnon. McKinnon says: I\ngot some dynamite here,\nand he gave it to Timothy Good with the idea that maybe Timothy\neventually could publish it. Now the question is, are they going to\ntry to extradite Timothy Good to the United States and put his butt\nin front of a jury and a judge?\n\n\n\nBut\nwe do not know. The Brits I met in Barcelona told me that this\nstory is pretty definite, pretty true.\n\n\nAh,\nbut what did McKinnon download? Ah! Let me just touch upon a couple\nof things \u2013 orders, military orders, transferring a Commander\nfrom one vessel to another vessel. Now, the vessels were named USSS\nCurtis Lemay and the\nother vessel that this guy transferred to, this Commander, was the\nUSSS\nRoscoe Hillencotter.\n\n\nNow,\nCurtis Lemay, most of you are well aware, dead now, one of our top\nFour-Star Air Force Generals, who bombed Japan back to the Stone Age,\npractically, because he was Strategic Air Command. There is a vessel\nnamed the USSS Curtis\nLemay and a Commander\ntransferred from that to the USSS\nRoscoe Hillencotter.\n\n\nNow,\nRoscoe Hillencotter is dead now, but he was a Four-Star Navy Admiral\nwho was the first Director of Central Intelligence. Now, the guys,\nthe researchers, have gone to the records and there ain\u2019t no\nlisting of vessels with those names in the entire US Navy Manifest.\n\n\nSo,\nthe question arises: My\nGod, where is the Curtis Lemay?\nWhere is the Hillencotter?\nThe inference we are\ngetting is that, apparently, they are in orbit somewhere out\nthere. And now we are talking about one of the biggest secrets\nof all time \u2013 where your missing trillions have probably been\ngoing.\n\n\n\nThere\nis a separate space program, which you guys are paying for and\nthey are not telling you anything about it, and as a result,\nNASA is a bit of a joke. We have a special space program and it is\napparently known as the United States Aerospace Command and it is a\njoint service agency. That means it includes Navy, Army, Air Force,\nMarine Corps, and it also includes the British Aerospace Command.\n\n\nThey\nlaunch satellites from several different positions on the planet.\nThey maintain, apparently, an entire fleet of vessels in orbit. They\nhave anti-gravity and zero-point energy, which you guys have a right\nto and you ain\u2019t going to see for another ten years.\n\n\nNow,\nthat\u2019s where your missing trillions have gone. You know the\nstory: \u201998, \u201999, and 2000, $1.7  a year\nfor three years disappeared off the books. That bunch of clowns in\ncongress; do you think there was an uproar? Do you think there was a\ndemand for answers? Where did that money go? Forget it!\n\n\n\nNow,\nthe day before 9/11 the Secretary of Defense says: we are\nmissing three trillion dollars. We cannot account for it. It\u2019s\noff the books, somehow. we are working on it. It may be an\naccounting error. \nYou know how they are: Doublespeak. George Orwell would be happy with\nthis crowd.\n\n\n\nMissing\nthree trillion, after the already missing of $1.7  a year\nfor three years? There is where the funding is coming for your\nAerospace Command that Daniel Inouye is talking about \u2013 a\nseparate shadow government that you have no idea exists. And those\nguys have got the technology that Ben Rich says is 100 years beyond\nestablishment knowledge.\n\n\n\nAnd,\nreally, if you talk about being pissed-off, that kind of information\ndrives me up the wall. I say to you guys -- and I hope you are\nas pissed-off about it as I am -- we have damn well got to get\nsome answers from these idiots back there, or our country is gone\nforever \u2013 and I do not want to see that happen.\n\n\n\nWhen\nI went into the military, I signed an Oath to die for that\nConstitution if I had to, and I believe in that Constitution. It was\na work of genius, the best form of government that\u2019s ever been\ndevised. they are trashing it and we are not standing up\nand defending it enough. we are not insisting that they account\nfor being in office and drawing those big salaries.\n\n\n\nOkay, guys, I have covered a whole lot of stuff here. As I said,\nI tend to wander. I guess it\u2019s the name of the game. I am\ncoming to the end of my presentation here.\n\n\nAs\nI said, I have been speaking out rather bluntly and loudly for a\nnumber of years on this subject. As I said, it\u2019s the biggest\nstory in human history because it IS the story OF human history. It\u2019s\nyour story. It\u2019s who you are, how you got to be here, and where\nyou are going.\n\n\nAnd\nI told you that I am outraged at the doom-sayers. Oh, God! 2012,\nwe are doomed. It\u2019s all over! The asteroids! Whatever. A\npole shift. we are all doomed.\n\n\nThat\nMayan shaman in Germany years ago told me, he said: You\nwhite-skins, you do it every time, you screw it all up.\nHe said: That\u2019s not\nwhat the hell the story is.\n\n\nHe\nsays: I am an expert\non my calendar. I am an expert on the history of my people and\nthat\u2019s not the end of the damn world \u2013 it\u2019s the\nbeginning of a new age.\n\n\nHe\nsays: We look forward to\nit with anticipation and excitement. The old world is coming to a\nclose and a new way of thinking is coming, and it\u2019s going to be\nso unlike anything that\u2019s ever existed before,\nhe said, we are so excited\nabout the future. \n\n2012\n\u2013 that day will come and go. It'll be the end of our long\ncount, but so what? What\u2019s important is there\u2019s a New Age\ncoming. And you guys are\nall a part of it.\n\n\nAnd\nI say, in closing, that there are going to be some difficult times\nahead because we are literally in this transition that is a\ntransformative transformation, not only of the planet, but of the\nhuman species. And it\u2019s primarily spiritual in its nature. That\nis a very hopeful thing to discuss and understand and accept.\n\n\nAs\nI said, we are phasing out of a phase of adolescence. we are\ngoing through adolescence and we are going to reach adulthood.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou all remember, I am sure you do, adolescence was not a hell\nof a lot of fun. I found it painful as hell when I was going through\nit, and so did my mother and father while I was going through it.\nBut, we are making that transition, and it\u2019s hopeful and\nfavorable.\n\n\nI\nwant to leave you with a remark or two that I think is important.\n\n\n\nI am\na great fan of Leo Tolstoy; one of my favorite authors. He was a\nmystic, a tremendous, great writer, philosopher. Count Leo Tolstoy\nsaid, and I quote:\n\nThere\nis something in the human spirit that will survive and will prevail.\nThere is a tiny and brilliant light burning in the heart of man that\nwill not go out, no matter how dark the world becomes.\n\n\nAnd\nI want to leave you tonight with that comment about that spark of\nDivinity that burns brightly within each and every one of you.\n\n\n\nGod\nbless you and good night.\n\n\n[long\napplause/ hoots/ whistles/ ovation]\n\n\nThank\nyou!  I am finished.\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKerry\nCassidy\n(KC):  Marcia Schafer herself is a contactee and a very gifted\nintuitive; she has amazing gifts and information to share with you\nfrom her contacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s\nwritten one book, Confessions\nof an Intergalactic Anthropologist,\nand it\u2019s available on her website which is www.beyondzebra.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have\nread her book. It\u2019s a fascinating book; it\u2019s well worth\nthe time. I encourage you to read it. It\u2019s a lovely, lovely\nbook. She\u2019s actually an old soul and I have to say that I know\nher from other lives.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway,\nthis is Marcia Schafer. She\u2019s also Bob Dean\u2019s partner and\nI am not supposed to say that in the lead, I know, [Marcia\nlaughs] so I am saying it at the end of my introduction... I\nwant you to take note, Marcia Schafer.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe\nis also an executive... I am not sure how you\u2019d term it,\nmaybe an executive coach. I am going to let her characterize\nthat herself.\n\n\n\n\nSpeak\nto me, Marcia, and let us make sure that your mic is working.\n\n\n\n\nMarcia\nSchafer (MS):\n Hello everybody! \n\n\n\n\nKC:\n Okay, Marcia, I\u2019ll let you take it from here.\n\n\n\n\nMS:\n Okay. Well, thank you all for coming and thank you for having me.\nWhen Kerry first invited me, I said: You\nknow, I am not really so sure I should be here. I am really\nnot a whistleblower, I do not do conspiracy.\n\n\n\nAND\nSHE SAID:  No,\nno, no, we want you to be a part of this.\n\n\n\nSO\nI SAID:  All\nright, I\u2019ll give it a shot.\n\n\n\nSo\nwith that we were supposed to put in our biographies and our\npictures, and I have got to tell you I got a little bit upset\nbecause I did not get it in on time and Kerry and Bill went into\nthe old archives and pulled something themselves. And I just thought\nit was totally inappropriate, but I am going to let you folks\ndecide as we begin to talk about metamorphosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo\nthis is what they put up of me and my bio [shows slide of a picture\ntaken behind her]  Marcia\ntried to rekindle her modeling career, but sadly in the intervening\nyears everything had gotten a bit pear-shaped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo\nI learned to be on time with my stuff! \n\n\n\n\nOkay.\n What I am going to start with is an old Vedic saying. Well, all\nright, it\u2019s not an old Vedic saying; I got it on the Internet.\nBut still it\u2019s good and it\u2019s worth sharing. It\u2019s a\nstory about the Bull and the Crow.\nYou may have heard it, but it\u2019s worth repeating, particularly\nhere and today. \n\n\n\n\nThere\nwas the bull in a meadow that was watching an old crow stumble along\nand he saw that the crow had no energy and was really struggling.\n\n\n\n\n\nHE\nWALKED OVER TO THE CROW AND HE SAID:  Crow,\ncome here. I know how to fix what\u2019s wrong with you.\n\n\n\nTHE\nCROW LOOKED UP AT THE BULL AND SAID:  What?\n\n\n\nAND\nHE SAID: You\njust have to do what I say and you have to do it for three days\nstraight.\n\n\n\nTHE\nCROW LOOKED UP AT HIM AND HE SAID:  Well...\nokay.\n\n\n\nAND\nTHE BULL LOOKED DOWN AND HE SAID:  All\nright. you have got to eat that.\n\n\n\nTHE\nCROW LOOKED UP AT THE BULL AND SAID:  you are\nkidding me, right?\n\n\n\nTHE\nBULL SAID:  No,\ncrow, you must... for three days straight. \n\n\n\nCROW\nSAID:  I\nam so not eating your poo, Bull!\n\n\n\nBULL\nLOOKED DOWN AND SAID:  Do\nyou want to get better? You must do it.\n\n\n\nSO\nTHE CROW SAID:  I am\ndying anyway -- what have I got to lose?\n\n\n\nFor\nthree days he ate the feces from the bull, and at the end of three\ndays, you know what? The crow got strong and he was able to fly once\nagain to the highest trees.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo\nhe took off and he landed in this huge pine tree and right below him,\nunbeknownst to him as he landed on the branch, along came a hunter.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE\nHUNTER HAPPENED TO LOOK UP, SEE THE CROW, GOES:  I\nhate those damn crows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOW!\nShot the crow...\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nthe moral of the story: Bullshit can take\nyou to the top, but it cannot keep you there.\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nI thought that there\u2019re so many people crowing about so much\nbullshit these days that that was the perfect thing to open up with.\n\n\n\nSo\nI mean, look, everybody is nervous these days. you are hearing\nall this talk about 2012 and this old Mayan legacy that\u2019s been\nleft to us, and people are scared that Armageddon is just around the\ncorner.\n\n\n\nEarth\nchanges \u2013 Should\nI head for the hills? Where should I go? Is there going to be water,\nfood? Where should I take my family?\n\n\nPeople\nare giving you all their channeled information and their channeled\nprophesies and telling you that This\nis the truth and we must do what I am saying because it\u2019s\ncoming from beyond.\n\n\nExtraterrestrial\ninvasions \u2013 People are telling you that all sorts of things are\nabout to unfold with extraterrestrials.\n\n\nSo\nKerry was trying to tell you what I do. I am actually a business\nconsultant of a very unusual type, because I also use my psychic\nabilities and my experiences with extraterrestrial contact with\npeople in over 30 countries, helping them become humanitarian\npioneers.\n\n\n\nBut\nI tell you, by the time they come to me they usually look like\nthis... [shows slide of a man freaking out, hands on the sides of his\nface, screaming] from everything that\u2019s going on. [audience\nlaughter] It\u2019s a tough road for them to take.\n\n\nSo\nas we begin to talk about things, what\u2019s really important to me\ntoday and one of the biggest messages I can give you is that we have\nto talk about: What\nis truth?\nBecause everybody tries to give you their version of truth. You know,\nwho has the authority to say that they have the only version of it?\n\n\n\nYour\njob as you listen to each of us... just because we are up here\ndoes not mean anything, and especially me. I have lived the life\nI am about to tell you about and had the experiences I am\nabout to tell you about. I know they are real because I went\nthrough it. You do not know me from Adam; you do not know\nthat.\n\n\n\nYou\nhave got to develop your discretionary abilities to a very, very high\nlevel and just listen to everything and synthesize it into what may\nmake sense to you as we go forward.\n\n\nJust\nbecause you think an extraterrestrial may be the source, or some\nchanneled angel, does not necessarily make it the barometer by\nwhich you should live your lives. So question me in particular and\njust look at it as a particular journey.\n\n\n\nyou have\nall had extraordinary experiences or been exposed to them to some\ndegree or you would not be spending $150 bucks for this weekend,\nI can assure you of that; so you know that a lot of this stuff is\ngoing to be commonplace to some of you. But I just cannot stress\nenough how important it is that you all really just put on your truth\nbarometer and figure out what\u2019s right for you.\n\n\nSo,\nwhat my job is, is to teach you to think smartly\nbecause thinking smartly is a hybrid approach and it is using both\nthe intellect (the cognitive processes), and the wisdom of your\nintuitive knowing.\n\n\n\nThis\nmay sound like some very nice New Age preachiness, but in my work\nwith people, as I am turning them on to putting on their higher\nswitches, this is something that we really get into because in the\nhuman condition it\u2019s extraordinarily unique.\n\n\n\nThe\ncognitive functioning, the intellectual reasoning that you have...\nwhen you combine that with your eternal Soul-Mind and your eternal\nSoul-Knowing, you have a very, very powerful tool to decipher\nreality, but we do not flicker them on together all the time \u2013\nwe use them separately, or one at the exclusion of the other. So I\nwant you to be thinking with your head\nand your heart\nat all times.\n\n\nNow,\nas we begin, we really need to be looking at... we are talking\nabout... God, you know, the change,\nand all these things happening.\n\n\n\nAre\nthese changing times right now? To some degree, yes, they are, but\nwe have had change happening throughout history, but what\u2019s\nunique is that we have had change at an unprecedented level,\nparticularly over the past 50, 100 years.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwe have had beautiful green environments and healthy living, and\nwe have turned around and we have trashed it to where our\nlifestyles are so polluted worldwide. Our food chain is tainted\nbeyond belief. Our breathing is fouled by the stench of horribly\nputrid air, and everything that we touch, basically, is not in a very\ngood spot.\n\n\nBut\nwe are talking about, this weekend, change on an unprecedented\nlevel that everybody\u2019s thinking that this amazing thing is\ngoing to be happening, and happening very soon.\n\n\n\nSo\nis there really any change that\u2019s going on for us? Yes, I\u2019d\nsay there is. I mean, you have got to make up your own minds. I\nknow a lot of you already believe it, but I\u2019d say there is and\nthat it\u2019s on three levels.\n\n\n\nNow\nas I said, I am working with people in over 30 countries. These\nare not people who you\u2019ll necessarily see to your left and your\nright at a conference like this. These are everyday people who are\nbeginning to have some very profound things happen to them that they\nare waking up to a new degree. they are having paranormal\nexperiences. Some are having extraterrestrial contact.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthese are people that are in... you know, whether they are a\njudge, a lawyer, an executive, a head of an agency, a doctor, a\nbiochemical researcher, a housewife bringing up six kids, you know, a\ncollege student. I have worked with people from 9 to 93. One of\nmy favorites is the 93-year-old. She sends me the dirtiest stuff on\nthe Internet, I just cannot believe it!  She\u2019s a\nhoot! But she\u2019s extremely aware and she actually had a very\nprestigious occupation in her life.\n\n\nSo\nsomething is going on in personal change because we have come\nfrom a very strong emphasis of getting more stuff \u2013 you know,\ngoing to Macy\u2019s, they are having a sale on Saturday \u2013\nto really taking time out to find that inner focus and what is\nactually important to us.\n\n\n\nwe are\nalso seeing change on a social level. There are a lot of things\nhappening where... are the majority of people still going about, not\ngoing paying attention? You betcha. But there is a tremendous stream\nof awakening happening in everyday life, in every society, where\npeople are again beginning to look at things very differently.\n\n\n\nAnd\nyou hear so much about the young. There\u2019re still the same old\nkids doing the same old things that we did, but some of these\nyoungsters are extremely wise and extremely aware, and are talking\nabout things that I just never talked about when I was young and most\nof my friends did not either.\n\n\n\nthey are\nlooking at life with very sage, elder eyes. They know what they want\nto do; they feel like they have a purpose to their life. At eight\nyears old they are going out and starting businesses and\nbeginning to do new things.\n\n\nBut\nas we look at all this change, again I want to remind you that we have\nalways\nhad change. You know, there was time where we would see the Vikings\ncome in on the shore and go: Holy\ncow! Sound the alarm!\nWe\u2019d be afraid of the loss of our civilization and what was\nhappening. This is just another phase in our development.\n\n\nBut\nthere\u2019s another aspect to change. There\u2019s planetary\nchange. we are looking at things around us on the environment.\n\n\n\nI\nwas really shocked to see the THIS [shows slide of the front page of\nthe NY Times] on the New\nYork Times,\nAugust 9th, this headline... some of you may have seen it. Front\npage: Climate\nchange.\nNow, not only is it climate change, look what\u2019s below: Seen\nas threat to US security. Pentagon studies issue. Crisis may\ndestabilize regions and require military action.\n\n\nWHOA!!!\nYou know?  That\u2019s something you\u2019d think you\u2019d\nsee on Project Camelot!  So people are paying attention to\nsome degree to the planetary change, even though some still try to\ndeny it.\n\n\n\nBut\nwhat is going on with this global warming? And is it something that\u2019s\nhappening here on the planet or is it something that could be further\non beyond? Because we tend to stop when we think about things, and we\ntend to think about our direct parameters around us and the world.\n\n\n\nBut\nwhat is going on out there in that unseen vast void of the universe?\nWe think of the world like this.... [shows slide of a normal-looking\nEarth, then a slide showing electromagnetic fields around the Earth]\nBut there\u2019s all kind of fields and properties around the planet\nthat we really do not pay much attention to that we need to be\ntaking a look at that could be influencing us from beyond the borders\nof our planet, and what\u2019s going on.\n\n\nBut\nat the fundamental heart of this metamorphosis and this change that\u2019s\ntaking place is something that\u2019s a little bit different now,\nand it\u2019s not necessarily a 2012 prophecy. It\u2019s not\nnecessarily extraterrestrial visitation.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nsomething very, very obvious and in front of us, and what is changing\nare the perspectives that people have. We are now able to look at\nthings very differently because life has changed around us, so we\nhave new tools of interpretation.\n\n\n\nWhen\nI first came out, I think it was 12, 13 years ago, to publicly talk\nabout having a lifetime of extraterrestrial contact and what I\nlearned, there was still a bit of trepidation on behalf of people.\nThere were those people who said: Yeah,\nI think it\u2019s probably true. I want to hear what she has to say,\nand\nthere was still a great degree of people who did not want to\nhear anything.\n\n\n\nBut\nnow the majority of people are saying: Well,\nyou know, I have not had those experiences myself but I think\nit\u2019s probably quite likely that it\u2019s out there,\nbecause we have got media, we have got technology, we have\nall kinds of tools to help us reinterpret reality and what we have\ngot going on around us.\n\n\nSo\nwe still have two camps. We have people who are looking at things\nthat  perspectives from the conventional eyes: the economy,\nfinances, mortgage institutions, politics, relationships,\npowerbrokers, technology.\n\n\nBut\nthen we have people like who are looking at  unconventional world\nin terms of what is it that science does not tell us? What is\nreally going on with space and solar activity? What\u2019s happening\nout there with cosmic radiation and how does it affect us? I mean,\nfor gosh sakes, if a Sun, an orb billions of years away, can turn my\nskin brown, then obviously if there\u2019s radiation fields and\nactivity out there that I am not aware of; it can\ninfluence me, and influence me at depths and levels I am not\naware of.\n\n\nwe are\nredefining extraterrestrial reality. So many of you are having your\nown experiences, and we have heard different interpretations\nabout human evolution and who we are and who we have been.\n\n\n\nConsciousness\nis taking a radical new leap as we are looking at it beyond\nFreud, beyond Jung, and into some new levels and some new depths as\nyou are exploring who you are and what you can do; and certainly\nthe historical redacts of looking at our history on this planet of\nwho we have been and who we can be.\n\n\nQuality\nof life is taking precedence over some other things that are there,\nlike making money and having a 401K.\n\n\n\nAnd\nmost importantly, there is a huge flow of your paranormal skill-set\nbeing turned on within a subgroup of the population. It\u2019s not\nhappening with everybody, but it\u2019s happening with quite a few,\nas you know in your own experiences that you are able to see,\nknow, and hear things and have extra abilities that were once\nrelegated to Jeane Dixon and just a few who were out there.\n\n\nSo\nwhat am I doing with all of this information that has been given to\nme? Because, as Kerry said, I have had, as some of you may know,\nkind of an odd lifetime and I have had the opportunity to learn a\nlot of information \u2013 not from books, not from going to\nconferences \u2013 but from extraterrestrials and entities who\naren\u2019t native to our planet.\n\n\n\nNow\nI\u2019ll tell you, if I had not had these experiences myself,\nI\u2019d be looking at that woman up there and going: She\u2019s\nwhacked; I just cannot relate.\nBut when they become personalized, then there\u2019s no doubt about\nit, about what happened. And so I have had a very unconventional\ncurriculum.\n\n\n\nSome\nof the things that I am going to briefly touch on today in the\ntime that we have are: I have been introduced to the soul life as\na primary underlying force of our existence and being made to\nunderstand that there is something more than just who we are.\n\n\n\nI have\nmet \u201cthe family\u201d in terms of many different species and\nraces out there.\n\n\nI have\nbeen introduced to some new things about genetics, consciousness,\nlooked at history in a way that has not quite been looked at\nbefore.\n\n\n\nAnd\nmost importantly, that has given me the understanding of what we have\ndone a lot here on Earth and why we do not understand things, is\na new interpretation of what we call time-space.\n\n\nThis\nis all leading up to what I have been taught is that... what the\nfuture can be and that the future is not set in stone.\n\n\n\nAnd\nso what I have done is I am planting seeds of people around the\nworld rather than saying: Buy\nmy book; read my book; oh I want to get on Oprah.\nTrust me, I do not want to get on Oprah and I do not want\nanybody reading my book. It does not belong in Costco or any place\nlike that.\n\n\n\nSo,\nyou know, I have decided to work with people on an individual\nbasis in giving them the seeds and the skills and the talent that\nthey need to be successful, to go forward and flower a new life.\n\n\nNow\nobviously, in the little amount of time we have, I cannot cover\nall those things but I am going to try to emphasize the soul\nlife, our futures, and planting seeds, along with some of these other\nthings.\n\n\nNow,\nyou know when it comes to extraterrestrial reality, it\u2019s kind\nof, for those of you who have not had the direct contact,\nthere\u2019s kind of that \u201clet us do lunch\u201d kind of\nattitude towards it.\n\n\n\nI\nget people calling me up or leaving messages saying: Can\nyou arrange...\nit\u2019s almost like Match.com... Can\nyou arrange for me to meet with an extraterrestrial,\nwith a list of attributes that it\u2019s like I am running a\ndating service.  It does not work that way! It does not\nwork that way at all.\n\n\n\nYou\nknow, there are so many different races out there that unfortunately\nwe tend to get confined to the beliefs that are fed to us by the\nmedia. So we are used to the little Grays, you know, some\nchanneled information about reptilians, but do not be limited to\nthat. There are many, many different life-forms out there, some with\nclassical types of civilizations and cultures, and some who are way\nbeyond that.\n\n\nThe\nslides that you are looking at now, these are life forms from\nhere.  This is life from the\nocean. Now, tell me if that\u2019s not strange! You know, how can we\nkind of look at what\u2019s out there and say: Gosh\nit just does not fit into my paradigm of reality?\n\n\nWe\nhave all different types of life, and as I am going to hit on in\na little bit, that it\u2019s all sentient, and what I have\nlearned \u2013 it\u2019s all conscious. Because as I have\nlearned through my contacts with extraterrestrials, they also opened\nup my capacity to communicate with the animal world and to realize\nhow sophisticated they are and what they have going on.\n\n\nSo\nas we look at life that\u2019s around us, we cannot really say\nthat this is really that much more strange.\n\n\nNow,\nI think we need to talk a little bit about their communication and\nwhat they have to say because this is really important. What I want\nto do is I want to give you some benefit of the wisdom that I have\ngained from working with a lot of different races.\n\n\n\nI\nthink there\u2019s a joke in the universe \u2013 you know, it\u2019s\nkind of like \u201cHow does the chicken cross the road?\u201d \u201cHow\ndo you get a human to do anything?\u201d  The answer is\nplay to his ego, tell him he\u2019s special, he\u2019s an\nambassador; we will give him any appointment he wants... he\u2019ll\ndo anything we want. And this is so true.\n\n\n\nyou have\nso often seen people who have been so enamored of having...\nwhether it\u2019s a channeled situation or they have had a\ncontact face-to-face situation, and they get some information. They\ngo running out, they want to be on a talk radio show or they want to\nbe in the media and: we are\ngoing to have contact at 3 pm on August 12. It will be a meteor going\nby, and if you look really hard, you\u2019ll see them.\nOver and over again, it never happens.\n\n\nAnd\nso what I have found, whether we like it or not, I feel that there\u2019s\nalmost like a fraternity hazing that goes on with some of us who have\nthis type of situation. Because when you find you do not\nnecessarily fall into that, and you question what\u2019s going on,\nand you try to wake up your cognitive processing as you are in\nthis sometimes fugue state as you are with them, they gain...\nthey give you respect when you act a little differently and you show\nyou are independent and you do not necessarily fall in\nline.\n\n\nIn\nmy situation what I encountered was all of a sudden I began to\nreceive some very advanced teachings about life, reality, humans \u2013\nwhat I call \u201cthe wisdom track\u201d, and I felt very\nprivileged to be able to get that.\n\n\n\nSo\nwhen you have the privilege of having an extraterrestrial encounter\nexperience, what I want you to know is that you can often fall into a\ntype of fugue state. It\u2019s like your Soul-Mind is coming on and\nbecoming active, but you need to keep that intellectual process open,\nand keep your cognitive mind on and question, and not just accept\nthings as they come to you. And that\u2019s going to really make a\ndifference.\n\n\n\nYou\nknow, think about it. It\u2019s like when our researchers work with\ngorillas, and you have heard of Koko, the famous signing gorilla.\nIf you walk in and you are starting to work with Koko and all of\na sudden, she does not just say: Red\nball,\nshe says: I\nwant carrot cake for dinner,\nyou are\ngoing to go: Whoa!\nI can go to a whole new level with this being\nand you can teach her at a more sophisticated level.\n\n\n\nAnd\nreally, folks, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like sometimes with us,\nis that when you go to a new level, they do too.\n\n\nOkay,\nwhat I want to do is share with you some of the messages that they\noften bring because now I have now told you to question their\nmessages, but what are some of the ones that they can share?\n\n\n\nYou\nhear from everybody who has had contact, they\u2019ll talk a lot of\ntimes about environmental concerns. Sometimes they\u2019ll have very\npersonal messages for people.\n\n\nBut\none of the things that happened to me after over five decades of\ncontact is when I was in my 40s, I had a very, very profound and very\ndifferent visit that changed my life.\n\n\n\nIt\nwas one week after what many of you here may know as the Phoenix\nLights\nthat happened on March 13, 1997. I live in Phoenix and I really\ndid not pay any attention to them, even though they happened\nover my house, but I had a contact visit a week later where they made\nreference to that and they let me know that they had been there.\n\n\n\nBut\nwhat they had, as I am going to distill it down, it was a very\nprofound, very long visit, but I am going to distill it down to\nthree particular messages, knowing that they have entrained me to\nunderstand that the future is nothing more than a probability... the\nfuture is mutable.\n\n\n\nThey\nhave helped me to understand, and this is so important for all of us,\nthat the future can be whatever we will\nit and want\nit to be. That\u2019s why we have to behave so differently and\nbecome empowered.\n\n\nThey\ntalked about three things. They did talk about that there was going\nto be what they called \u201ca Triune Setting,\u201d [this term is\nthe best that we understood it to be] that at some point in the\nfuture...\n\n\n\nAnd\nI have got to stop and tell you, you know, this drives me nuts,\nbecause... the future... What? Next Thursday? 3012? You know, time is\ndifferent to them; they never really pin it down.\n\n\nBut\nat some time in the future that there was going to be what they\nreferred to as a \u201cPortal Opening\u201d that would have great\nsignificance for us.\n\n\n\nNow,\nI do not really, you know, get very involved in the 2012\nphenomenon; I am very involved in today and just moving forward.\nBut I wonder because there\u2019s such a great astrological\nconfiguration happening on that date that everybody\u2019s talking\nabout, if that\u2019s what they were referring to.\n\n\nBut\nat some point they said this really does have significance because\nit\u2019s an opening in and out of our Galaxy and our particular\nplace in the universe that has meaning, and it does not happen\nbut very rarely, in probably thousands and thousands of years.\n\n\nThey\nalso made reference to that in our time there was supposed to be the\ndiscovery of records that would reveal a very different history on\nour planet. They showed me pictures of what I thought were the\nEgyptian pyramids and the Sphinx and that area, and they said that\nwhen these are revealed there will be no refuting the history of the\nextraterrestrial legacy.\n\n\nI\ncannot imagine what would be on it because you can refute\nanything and just say that it\u2019s myth and story and culture. But\nthey said that there was something there.\n\n\nI\u2019ll\ntell you, since that happened over ten years ago when that particular\nvisit happened, I also now wonder something very differently about\nthis. I wonder if, actually, this may not be Egypt, but it may\nactually be a part of the ancient Atlantean lands that are down by\nBermuda and Florida being able to rise up and have some of these\nmonoliths on them. It\u2019s just a thought that I have had.\n\n\nThe\nthird thing they said is something that they do not want to have\nhappen, and at that time they were very, very concerned about a\nnuclear detonation going off in what seemed to be the Middle East\nregion. So far, ten, twelve years later, we are doing good. It\nhas not gone off.\n\n\n\nBut\nwhat they said was that it\u2019s going to be a very naive situation\nshould the nuclear detonation take place, because that there\u2019s\na major fault-line and if it does it\u2019s going to trigger this\nand therefore it\u2019s going to affect the quality of life... For\neveryone on your planet, and it will not be contained to a\nparticular singular region like you saw when you detonated the bomb\nbefore.\n\n\nSo\nthese are the nature of some of the messages and some of the things\nthat they can tell you and share with you.\n\n\n\nNow,\nI am saying this because are these true? I do not know. I\nfind them fascinating. I find them interesting and I am very\nproud that I have had the privilege to hear them from them. But I\nalso know that it does not mean that any of them are necessarily\ngoing to happen, that they are potentials for our future that\ncan have greater bearing on us and what comes to fall for us.\n\n\nThe\nother thing they shared... and I know I am going fast but I only\nhave so much time and so I\u2019ll be available later to go into\ngreater depth of all these things... is that they told me about our\npast in a very different way.\n\n\nWhat\nthey did is they said that: Yes,\nyou were a genetically-altered species...\nand I learned about this way before any of this came out into the New\nAge culture. They said that: It\u2019s\na little different than you think, though.\n\n\nThey\ntaught me about Zecharia Sitchin, who many of you have heard of,\nbefore I was even aware of who the man was. They told me to go\nexplore his work because they said he\u2019s very close to what it\nwas.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthey said after I explored it, that: you are\na hybrid race, but it\u2019s not just that you had this Anunnaki\ncoming here who created you.\n\n\nThey\nsaid: What\nit is, is you are actually a mixture of twelve genetic strains\nof what we would call extraterrestrial DNA and that when the\nlife-form was tinkered with, it was not one cultural life-form\noverlaying its presence, it was a genetic mixture.\n\n\n\nThey\nwent into some very interesting details about it with the science\nthat was used where what I call harmonic\nor sonic\nresonance\nwas used to... This may sound like total meta-poop; I know, because I\nhave scientific background, but it\u2019s interesting so I am\ngoing to share it.\n\n\n\nThey\nsaid that a sonic resonance... they used actually sound frequency\nwhen they were doing the genetic tinkering to get the strains to gel\nand to work with each other.\n\n\nSo\nwhat all this does is it allows us to look at what we know with new\neyes and to think: Well,\nmaybe; that definitively could be.\nAnd hopefully what it will do is will eventually entrain conventional\ntraditional science, the renegades who are working within the fringe,\nto start looking along these new lines.\n\n\nBecause\nwe know that it\u2019s not a question of Darwinism or Creationism \u2013\nboth have aspects and flaws within them \u2013 that it\u2019s\nsomething else, and it\u2019s probably not just a third alternative\nbut multiple. And when you look at extraterrestrial presence on this\nplanet and the fact that there was probably genetic tinkering, it\ncertainly seems to make a lot of sense to me.\n\n\n\nWhat\nis really intriguing to me is how they went about all of this, and\nthe way that they gave me this really new curriculum. It was not\nnecessarily sitting down in a lecturing situation; it was a lifetime\nof experiences that I had that I could not synthesize and did not\nrealize that they were all coming together to have a focused meaning\nuntil I was in my 30s, and I\u2019d been going through this since I\nwas in the crib.\n\n\nWhat\nthey did was they actually took me to experience certain things where\nI would actually be taken and I\u2019d be witnessing... I do not\nknow whether it was a hologram or a point in space-time that was in\nthe past, but I\u2019d be witnessing and looking at a group of\nworkers who were working under another race. I now later realize they\nwere showing me that man actually had been used for some slave\npotential on this planet and had been harnessed for his capacity to\nhelp... well, \u201chelp\u201d is a generous word, is not\nit?... to help another species.\n\n\nSo\nthe point is that it\u2019s not what you expect. It\u2019s not like\ngoing to Starbucks and it\u2019s not like just sitting down and they\nteach you, but they can have a very unique process to get you to\nunderstand a new system of reality and a new way of thinking, and it\ncan be very, very experiential.\n\n\nSo\nthose are just some of the things that I have been through with them.\n\n\n\n\nWhat\nI am most interested now is not really what\u2019s going on\nwith me, but what\u2019s going on with the culture and the way that\nwe are trying to get this out.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou look at [shows slide with cowboys, Daniel Boon-types\u2026 and\nETs ]... I love this ad from New Mexico. The New Mexican tourist\nindustry got a lot of flack for this: The\nbest place in the Universe, New Mexico, Earth.\n\nAnd if you look closely, you see that they have integrated the\nextraterrestrial persona of their state in there, which I think is\nvery intriguing.\n\n\nAnd\nif you go along now and you go into the modern culture, people, as I\nsaid, are really accepting more and more of what\u2019s out there.\nAm\nI am going crazy? Was this place Korean just last week?\n\n[shows\nslide of a cartoon of confused shoppers in a little,\nformerly-Korean-run store] You know, this is pretty much what we are\nlooking at and what we are facing.\n\n\nOkay.\nSo you know, as I mentioned before, what for me has been really\nbeneficial about the extraterrestrial contact is that it\u2019s\ngiven me new insights into not just human behavior, but something\nbigger. It\u2019s given me insights into where humanity fits within\nother species. You know, because in some ways, we are just those\ncrazy flesh-eating mammals with herd-like tendencies, and we tend to\nforget that. We tend to put ourselves at the top of the apex so that\nwe are the ultimate supreme species and we are a deity.\n\n\nWhat\nI have learned through how extraterrestrials communicate...\nbecause they use holographic processes. They will often send an image\nto you that has an accompaniment of instant knowing, and that this\ngoes on in the animal world too.\n\n\n\nInter-species\ncommunication is somewhat universal, and human beings use language,\nand ordered thought processes, that does not seem to be communal to\nthe rest of what is out there.\n\n\nWhen\nwe begin to penetrate into the species that are here beside us and\nthe animal kingdom and understand how sophisticated\ntheir thought processes are and how much they know of what goes on...\nthat they have their own cultures and relationships with each other,\nand they are not that different from us... it allows us to\nintegrate better with the concept of extraterrestrial reality.\n\n\nBecause\nI tell you, people are much more likely \u2013 not you, but the\naverage person \u2013 is much more comfortable looking at the fuzzy\nlittle animal (on the top) that talks [showing slide of a pair of\nhouse cats]  than extraterrestrial reality and since I do both, let\nme tell you, the ordinary people like the fuzzy little animals a lot\nbetter.\n\n\n\nSo\nwhat you\u2019ll learn and what the power of us... And love what\nGandhi had said. You know, people put it at the end of their Internet\nmessages, that: The\nmoral fiber of a nation is judged by how it treats its animals,\nor something like that.\n\n\n\nThat\nreally is at the underpinning of our moving forward, is understanding\nthat we are a collaborative species, that humans are not cut out\napart the way that we set ourselves to, that we have to understand\nthat we are one of a multiple order, and that order... well, it\ngoes off into the space realms... has to start right here at home. We\nhave to start paying better attention to what goes on -- on the\nplanet and how we are treating our animals.\n\n\nNow,\nI said I had an interesting curriculum. One of the very profound\nthings that they started early with was the concept of reincarnation.\n\n\n\n\nNow,\nmuch of the world... if you ask any Buddhist they say: Sure,\nno problem; got it, its part of our culture.\nThe Western world still has a problem with this. Reincarnation is\nsomething that, while there is a lot of different type of evidence\nfor it, cannot always necessarily be proved empirically.\n\n\n\nBut\nwhat they did with me is, starting when I was 12, 13, 14 years old,\nthey would come at night and I\u2019d be pulled out and I would sit\nthere and I would watch myself in these different existences. I would\nwatch and I would see myself as...\n\n\n\nI\nwas a tall thin black man in ancient Africa who was swept upon a\nleopard and became part of the food chain. I saw myself as a slave in\nancient Egypt \u2013 I looked down at my feet and I saw the hard\nground that I slept on and the straw. I saw myself as being buried\nalive with a man who was my husband because I was part of his\nproperty.\n\n\n\nAll\nthese things where I was dying and had left my body, because they\nwere trying to get across the idea that we have an eternal soul and\nthat they needed me to know not to be afraid, that no matter what\nhappened in this lifetime, that was not it;\nit\u2019s a part of the journey.\n\n\n\nAnd\nwith that, I was able to go forward and tackle life with a very\ndifferent perspective than if I had been terrified and afraid: Oh,\nI am going to die.\nwe are all\ngoing to die. We just do not know when, you know, and we are\nborn, we have lived, we have died time and time again. We\njust do not tend to remember it.\n\n\nWhen\nit comes to reincarnation, what I think is so important about it is\nthat not only does it remind us of the eternalness of our being, but\nit allows us to sometimes look at life with some new eyes and provide\nsome different answers.\n\n\nOne\nof the things that I was left with is the ability to look at somebody\nand I can immediately see their Soul and I can see the trail of the\nreincarnations that they have had.\n\n\nNow,\na lot of people say: Oh,\nwe should not get caught up in it; we belong in the here and\nnow.\nI agree in that wholeheartedly, but sometimes it gives us different\neyes to look at things differently.\n\n\nA\nwoman I worked with just a few weeks ago and as I talked to her and\nexplained to her the most prominent series of visions around her was\none in the 1800s in England and how she was involved in the early\nlabor union development, and how the smog and the soot just assailed\nher and she could not stand it; and she was so frustrated by\nwhat was happening with the businesses and how they were taking\nadvantage of the people at that time.\n\n\n\nAt\nthe end she laughed and she said: Well,\nI am not so sure there\u2019s anything to this or not but I\nactually got my Masters degree in studying labor law in England and I\nhave a real issue with the pollution. \n\n\nAnd\nyou will see that there are commonalities and carryovers and tie-ins.\nUsually the lives that surround you now are often the leftover issues\nthat we are still dealing with that we have pulled together.\nAnd if you can pull it together with your soul purpose and go forward\nand integrate it into your life as you move forward, then you\nwork-life can become your life-work.\n\n\nSo\nfor me the experience of working with the extraterrestrials, and the\nwhole journey of reincarnation, had a real profound impact because it\nwas not just about my journey, but it was about working with\nother peoples\u2019 journeys, too.\n\n\n\nSo,\nyeah, we cannot get caught up in it. It does not really\nmatter if you were Genghis Khan or Cleopatra. Who cares? But what\nreally matters is: What is your personal journey and what do you have\nto do now as you go forward?\n\n\n\nNow,\nleading to this and that we are eternal beings, the most\nimportant thing I have gotten from these experiences is that\nthere is\nactually\na \u201cscience of the soul\u201d, and a lot of the things that\nhappen to us are because of this.\n\n\n\nBut\nas humans... well, if we are not even really acknowledging that\nthere really is a soul, how are we going to begin to even uncover and\nuncap this science? And I have learned some fascinating things\nfrom them.\n\n\nNow,\nthis is where you put your hat on and decide. Even though I am\nspeaking authoritatively, do not let it fool you.  You\nhave to decide for yourself whether it\u2019s true or not.\n\n\nFrom\nwhat I have learned, the human being is a unique experience that\u2019s\na symbiont experience. There is this energetic\nelectric residue,\nif you want to call it, that comes in and binds with the biological\nunit, and there are two dual-operating systems that coexist \u2013\nwhich I think is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou know anything about the human body, you know you have the\nsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems which work together.\nOne controls the powerful things like blinking, heart beating,\nrespirations.\nThe other one says: I\nthink I am going to move my hand and stroke my hair, and I want\nto eat, and I am going to do some more complex operations\n\n\nApparently\nthere are two systems that learn to coexist in our body, and one is\nthe one that is related to the biological unit.\n\n\n\nWhen\nwe become activated and our soul gets turned on more as a primary\nlistening-point, then that operating system comes into greater power.\nIt gives you greater discipline, and it gives you greater\nunderstanding, and greater control to move forward as a more evolved,\nwillful human being.\n\n\nNow,\nthere\u2019s a whole... Obviously we do not have time for this,\nyou know, how the soul binds and how it separates. But the one\ninteresting thing that I think is really pertinent that I want to\nmention is that a lot of you have heard about with extraterrestrial\nexperiences  people become paralyzed and they cannot move.\n\n\nWhat\nthey showed me is that many of the races know how to actually\ndisengage the soul from the biological unit.\n\n\nWhat\nthey do, as they have explained to me, is that they actually can\ncome in and through their abilities they can rotate your nervous\nsystem \u2013 they can disengage it a little bit. What they say is\nthey just turn it a little bit so your synaptic junctions do not line\nup and you are not able to control your body, and therefore\nthat\u2019s where the paralysis comes in.\n\n\n\nAgain,\nI do not know if this is true. I have some medical and\nscientific background but not to that extent, but I think it\u2019s\nreally interesting and I think it merits further exploration as we\nlook into the new types of sciences that we should be exploring.\n\n\nSo,\nfor those of you who have those paralytic-type\nof encounters, oftentimes that\u2019s what happens. Or  you come\nback from a lucid dream and you slam back into your body and you\ncannot really move for a while, the alignment has not taken\nplace.\n\n\nThe\nreason I am sharing these types of things is that I want you to\njust look at life differently and say that there\u2019s many\ndifferent explanations for all these crazy things that can happen out\nthere. Some of them might make sense and might actually be proven if\nwe move in the right direction in science.\n\n\nSo\nthere\u2019s this whole science of the soul that provides a lot of\nexplanation for what happens and why it happens that we have yet to\nuncover, and once we do, things are going to make a lot more common\nsense.\n\n\nThe\nother thing is learning about that space and time and dimensions\ndo not coincide with our traditional understanding. I mean, why?\nThe human has an orientation and why we just do not get it is\nbecause we think linear. We think up;\nwe think down.\nWe think left/\nright,\neast/west,\nnorth/south.\nAnd because of that we have to learn to think more inside\nand outside\nand move in a different direction.\n\n\nI am\ngoing to go really fast now because I just got the warning sign.\n\n\n\nAll\nright, I want to talk to you real quickly and let you know that with\ntime-space and reality that there is something called a nodal\npoint\nand when you hear about people talking about attraction\nand things coming to you, part of it is tied into this.\n\n\n\nWhat\nwe are able to do is we are able to get ourselves to this\ncrux of time-space energy where everything can flow out, and you can\ndo this through your consciousness. What happens is, when you get\nyourself to the power of this nodal point and you start thinking in a\nconscious direction, you can redirect the flow of the futures that\ncome to you.\n\n\nAll\nright. So why are things happening now? Because, my friends, we have\nthese new eyes and capacity to reinterpret the world. Life used to be\nlike that... life is now like this... [refers to slide that shows the\nfamous \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d painting by Grant Wood in 1930;\nnext to the classic painting is a re-creation of the painting, but\nwith the farmer and wife talking on cell phones and the farmer has a\ngolf club instead of the pitchfork] because we have technology.,\nTechnology has given us the insider course to the answers for many of\nthe things that were not able to be understood before... and so, our\nancient alchemists are really today\u2019s modern scientists.\n\n\nSo\nwhat I have done for that first part is I have given you a\npreview of what it\u2019s been like and some of the things that I have\nlearned. Obviously I cannot dump 50-plus years into the course\nof 45-minutes-to-an-hour, but I wanted to give you a little bit of\ninsight into what it\u2019s been like for me.\n\n\nBut\nnow I am more interested in something far more important. It\u2019s\nnot about me... it\u2019s about you. And this is what I want to\nspend the last 15 minutes talking to you about.\n\n\nYou\nall have come here and you have all talked to yourself about, you\nknow: we have got this mission, we are awakening  we\nfeel special.\n\n\n\nYou\nhave a new job assignment and it\u2019s not that you are this\ngreat prophet or anything. you are really door-holders; you are\nin concierge services.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou want people to think differently and be open to your ideas, you\nneed to just gently introduce them to it in a way that\u2019s\npalatable to them. And that\u2019s what your responsibility is.\nBesides your own journey of awakening, you are also here for\nother people.\n\n\n\nThis\n is how humans\ntend to see the world. They tend to see it in their suburban\nbackground, in their isolated houses, in their little communities,\nand then their cities and they stay within their viewpoints. You\nnever even get them to look up into the sky hardly at all to see\nwhat\u2019s going  there. So we see ourselves as this contained\nglobe.\n\n\n\nBUT...\nhow you\nsee the world is different because you see it with the power of\nmetamorphosis and the power of change and of infinite possibility and\nyou know that what\u2019s been fed to us is not necessarily\nwhat\u2019s real.\n\n\nSo\nyour new job description is Metamorphosis and that you are\nChange-Agents of a new degree because you are dealing with\nextraterrestrial reality and human higher consciousness. And you have\nto do it in a way that you do not appear disenfranchised, you do not\nappear alienated from them, that they are able to listen to you\nand they want to listen to you.\n\n\nI\nmean, I have had this crazy background and extremely far-out and\nI have been very, very successful walking into many different\ncountries, many different corporations, many different businesses,\nmany different people, and have been able to give people some very\nstrong tools for progressing forward.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nall about the way that we communicate and the way that we do it. So I\nneed you to understand something about your audience because I want\nyou to have some tangible tools as you move forward.\n\n\nThis\nis who you are working with on the planet now. [shows slide with\nthe \u201cEL\u2019s, OH\u2019s and EM\u2019s ] I tend to call it\n\u201cAlphabet Demographics\u201d: EL\u2019s,\nOH\u2019s, and EM\u2019s\n\n\nOkay,\nthe EL\u2019s are what you\u2019d consider yourself: Enlightened\nLuminaries.\nYou know, you have seen it all... extraterrestrial, paranormal\nexperiences. you are in tune with those who connect with you in\nthe unseen world on the other side. Nothing fazes you and you are\nwell aware on the pathway.\n\n\nThe\nOH\u2019s are what I call the Ordinary\nHumans.\nThese are the people who are still out there. They may be interested\nin what Oprah has to say; they think all this is kind of interesting.\n\n\nAnd\nin that group is the Emerging\nHuman,\nthe \nand\nthose emerging humans, those are the people who are \u201cretarded\u201d\nin terms of making headway with them, that they would be willing to\nhear you if you communicate appropriately with them. This is what...\n\n\nKerry\nonce interviewed me and I called them \u201cthe swing vote\u201d.\nThese are the people who are looking to know more about what\u2019s\nout there, are fed up with what they have been told because it no\nlonger fits the world as they see it, but they need to have it\npackaged in a way that they can accept and is understandable to them.\n\n\nThis\nis where it is incumbent upon us to stop thinking about ourselves:\nOh,\nI do this; and I read this book; and I have this; and have you heard\nabout this...\nand to sit down, shut up, and listen to them and to start\nunderstanding where they come from, acknowledging who they are.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nnot about you. It\u2019s about you extending your hand and saying: I\nhear you, you know. I have some things to offer,\ninstead of overpowering them with what we have encountered on our\njourneys and what we know because they have some extraordinary things\nto share. These are the people who are going to determine our future.\n\n\nWe,\nof course, do have the EM\u2019s, the\nElementary Man,\nwho is what I call the\nfunda-mental,\nwhich I think is an appropriate word for them. These are the people\nwho are greatly filled with intolerance because they do not want\nyou challenging their paradigm. If you come forward with your ideas,\nand what you know, and the things we are talking about here this\nweekend, you have just violated their world and their sanctity.\nThat is something that they just will not tolerate and will create\na very difficult life for you.\n\n\nI\ngot this on the Internet. \nI\ndo not know who to attribute it to. It\u2019s one of the most\nbrilliant things I have ever seen \u2013 The\nWorld According to Americans.\n\n\n\nAmerica:\nwe are Number One; we are Number One. Eastern and Western\nEurope is, you know, pussies\nand communists.\nCoffee comes from South America. We only know Australia\u2019s\nkangaroos.  You know, the polar cap\u2019s\ncold... Santa!\n\n\nThis\nis really how most of America sees things and I\u2019d love to give\ncredit to whoever it came from but it came through anonymously.\nEvil-doers (Even though there\u2019re) bombs going here, you know...\n Mexico and South America, they do our\nlaundry and lawns.  You know? This is what we are\ndealing with, and you have got to remember and you have got\nto respect \u2013 this is their world too.\n\n\nOkay.\nSo your tools are... remember -- it\u2019s all about perspectives,\nand while this looks like a nice little design, [shows slide of an\nelephant skin] this is actually elephant skin. And so your tools are\nto show people that it\u2019s not what it seems, there\u2019s\nsomething deeper underneath it.\n\n\nAnd\nso your approach is the \u201cNew 3-Rs\u201d, which is not reading,\n\u2018riting, and \u2018rithmetic. This is something I work with\npeople in great depth with, and this is important.\n\n\n\nYou\nhave to make yourself relevant.\n\n\n\n\nYou\nknow, if you are just sitting there on your commune and you are\njust working with your own little sphere, it\u2019s not going to\nwork. You have to come into today\u2019s world if you really want to\nbe a change-maker. You have to do things within today\u2019s 21st\ncentury and make yourself relevant to today\u2019s culture and\nsociety.\n\n\nyou have\ngot to be realistic.\n\n\n\n\nyou have\ngot to look at what you are working with for the second \u201cR\u201d.\nYou have got to not just say: Well,\nyou know, the aliens are going to be here on Sunday; or:\nI am channeling them and you want to come hear them.\nyou have got to be realistic with who you are working with\nand what you are dealing with, and you need to speak to them in\nthose appropriate terms.\n\n\nBut\nmost importantly, my friends, you have got to be relatable.\n\n\n\n\nYou\nhave got to be able to be somebody that they are willing to look\nat, and to listen to, and to not be necessarily bringing your stuff\non them, but you are entering into their world.\n\n\n\nTwo\nthousand years ago you had a great teacher here and a lot of the\nteachings that were really relevant\nwere lost.\n\n\n\nOne\nof the things I will share with you, which you can dismiss or accept,\nis that there was a group that he worked with, and in this group, he\ntaught them the ways of the common ordinary man. He taught them about\ntheir behaviors and he taught them how to go forward, not just in\nthis lifetime but in their future lifetimes, as effective messengers,\nmessengers who will open the door, messengers of change... and in\ndoing that, you have to be relatable. As you read your old-time\nreadings, you will read about the ancient Essenes, how they would\nchange their robes when they went into town so they matched what the\npeople were wearing.\n\n\n\nSo\nthese three \u201cRs\u201d are things I want you to remember. And\nso, you know, the change that is happening, as I heard you all\ntalking about it before...  it\u2019s true.\n\n\nEnough\nwith all the spiritual mumbo-jumbo, Pal. What I am seeking is\nreal interchange,\nsaid the piggybank to the guru. [showing a cartoon of a coin piggy\nbank sitting in front of a guru]\n\n\nThe\nchange is us.\nWhen we\nchange, everything\nchanges. It starts within us, each and every one of us, and it has a\ngreat cascading effect.\n\n\nNow,\nI have got to say this before I finish up. The other part of\nmetamorphosis is financial, and that you have to realize that we are\nno longer these spiritual monks walking along with an alms bowl\nsaying: I\u2019ll\nteach you for a dinner.\n\n\nWe\nhave a lot of hang-ups about money and finances and, you know, it\u2019s\nparticularly apt now because of the state of the world. What we have\nto realize is that this is how we flex our collective arm on this\nplanet, through financial maneuverings and money.\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nnot money\nthat\u2019s bad. It\u2019s getting hung up on money. It\u2019s the\nkey of loving money, of wanting, you know, amassing millions and\nbillions, and living for a 401K instead of quality of life. So you have\ngot to get over this poverty consciousness of: I am\nspiritual, I am good, I am poor.\n\n\nWhat\nis important for us is to be independent functioning members of\nsociety, moving society forward. So it\u2019s the love of money, not\ngetting caught up in it, that is a critical tool for us to become\nfinancially aware and not have a hang-up if somebody wants to pay you\nfor your services and that you have a right to earn a living. Okay.\nSo it\u2019s sound spiritual economics.\n\n\n\nAnd\nwhat I want to show you is that it\u2019s no longer where we just\nused to be the wizard in the woods is what we were looking for, for\nthis magic change is that this\n is the\neveryday change-agent now. You may not like it, but a lot of you are\nactually still back in the traditional avenues making headway and\nmaking change.\n\n\nNot\neverybody comes to these types of things who are making a difference\non the planet and there have been a lot of people who are out there\ndeveloping new businesses, new technologies and doing the really hard\ngrunt work that\u2019s going to carry us all forward.\n\n\n\nSometimes\nthey still look like they used to, but you know, that with people in\nchange [loses cable connection to slides \u2013 deleted as not\nrelevant] sometimes they look like this. So sometimes that\nbusinessman is really somebody very profound who\u2019s back once\nagain.\n\n\n\nAnd\nso what I am choosing to do with all the knowledge that I have\nhad, rather than sitting down writing books and doing this type of\nthing, is I am looking at people and I am giving them very\nnew tools to change.\n\n\n\nI am\nhelping them on their incarnational trek to become aware of who they\nwere but how it has relevance to today; looking at their soul lessons\nand then repositioning them in a business-type and\nentrepreneurial-type of venture around the world; planting those\nhuman seeds of change and giving them the practical vision and skills\nthat they need to be able to function in the world as it now exists.\nIt may not be the one that you like. It may not be the one that you\nwant. It\u2019s the one that we have.\n\n\nAnd\nso they are doing some very amazing things, you know, and I love\nthis quote: Success\nin almost any field depends more on energy and drive than it does on\nintelligence because this explains why we have so many stupid\nleaders.\n\n\n\nwe are\ntrying to get rid of the stupid leaders and we are trying to put\nin the people who can make a difference and understand the synthesis\nof what is going on on the planet and that we need to move forward.\n\n\nWhat\nwe are seeing mostly around the world are lifestyle communities\nbeing built up, different ways of bringing up and educating the\nchildren, food production changes, and a total reeducation such as\nyou are doing here with Project Camelot.\n\n\nNow,\nas I get ready to leave you, I want you to know one thing and this is\nwhat has been made very clear to me by those who visit us and those\nwho teach, is that we are here together. We have a group\nincarnational lesson and if we do not pull this off, things most\nlikely aren\u2019t going to be as optimal for us as they could be.\n\n\nWhat\nthat group incarnational lesson is: Stop saying: You\nread Urantia.\nYou read Jane Roberts. You know, I do not believe in this. \n\n\nWe\nhave to look at each other and see the soul-lights within each other\nand see who we are as a collective group. We have to truly, as\nclich\u00e9d as it sounds, see the love in each other or it\u2019s\ngoing to... stop being kind of pissy with each other and deciding: I\ndo not like this; I am judging this.\nWe do not have time for that anymore.\n\n\n\nThere\nis a very short timeframe environmentally it looks like, does not\nit, for us to make some things differently.\n\n\n\nAnd\nso it\u2019s all about seeing the soul-light and networking with\neach other in a way that you never have before, making each other\nsmarter, and sometimes that networking involves a little bit of a\ndifferent partner, does not it?\n\n\nYou\nreally are your brother\u2019s keeper. This is what they told me.\nThat old biblical clich\u00e9... in this time, in this frame, it\nhas never been truer. You have to take care of yourself, but now\nyou are just as responsible for the other person; not: Well,\nit\u2019s just my stuff and my path.\n\n\n\n\nYes,\nI said it\u2019s up to each of us to change to make the change; now\nwe have to form the chain-link. Now we have to come out and work\ntogether and do it in a way that\u2019s very smart.\n\n\n\nThe\nreal secret behind all this -- if you want to make a difference -- is\npeople who do great things do not take NO\nfor an answer. They just go ahead and they forge and they find the\nresources and know what needs to be done.\n\n\nThey\nalso understand the power of kindness and you\u2019ll learn that\nit\u2019s far better to be kind than to be right. Being kind in\nbusiness and being kind as you go forward in your ventures has\ngreater weight than anything else you\u2019ll ever do.\n\n\n\nAnd\nmost importantly we have to realize it\u2019s not an\nextraterrestrial that\u2019s going to save us; it\u2019s not an\nangel. People who do great things know that man alone has the power\nto work out his destiny in combination with his own intelligence \u2013\nthat hybrid approach again, of the spirit, the soul, and the\ncognitive reasoning.\n\n\nSo\nwhen we talk about thinking outside the box, we are now taking\nit to a new level in terms of what the box is, you know. You folks\nalready are thinking way outside the box.\n\n\n\nSo\nwhen I look at metamorphosis, remember  behind the change on\nthis planet is a change in perspective. Your ability to see things\ndifferently, along with other peoples\u2019 capacity to now listen\nto the things you have to say, is rooted \u2013 a lot \u2013 in\nscience, technology, and advances bringing us to a new world.\n\n\n\nSo\nI love to end with this saying: Brave\nmen earn the right to shape their own destiny\nby Arthur Schlesinger, and I like to put my own little twist on it.\nTo all my little sisters out there: Brave\nwomen earn the right to shape their own destiny.\n\n\nSo,\nI know that I left out a lot because we had some difference in the\ntime changes. I know I went fast in some areas, but what I am\ngoing to say to you is I want to thank you so much for giving me the\nchance to bring you a little view of what I am doing out there\nin the world to try to make a difference.\n\n\n\nAs\nI say, I am going to be here if you want to talk to me and get\nsome more detail on the things that I just quickly glossed over.\n\n\nSo\nthank you for allowing me the time to be here.\n\n\n\n\n\nKC:\n Thank you, Marcia.\n\n\nBILL\nRYAN (BR):  Marcia, I think I am going to employ you as a\nconsultant to help me improve the quality of my visual presentations.\n That was so beautiful! I love those pictures.\n\n\nMS:\n Thank you, thank you.\n\n\nBR:\n That was wonderful. Thank you.\n\n\nMS:\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nKERRY\nCASSIDY (KC):  Here\nis\nMiriam\nDelicado, an incredible friend. We consider her a part of Camelot,\nbelieve it or not, because she is such a supporter and because we\ntend to work together with her, as we do  several of our\nwitnesses.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nan amazing dynamic \u2013 there\u2019s such teamwork happening.\nThat would also include David Wilcock and George Green, and actually,\nalmost everyone who is speaking at the conference has become someone\nthat we are sort of working with, someone we go to, to ask advice on\ndifferent matters, someone who has their own sort of agenda that\nwe are trying to support as well.\n\n\n\nIn\nMiriam\u2019s case, she\u2019s working with indigenous people, as\nyou may know, to bring peace to the planet, to also make people aware\nof various things. I am not going to speak for her here; I am\ngoing to let her do that.\n\n\n\nBut,\nI want to say that she\u2019s an amazing personality, as well as a\nspiritual being and I honor her as my colleague and friend, a dear,\ndear woman to me, and I am just very grateful that she\u2019s\nalive today\n\u2013 there\nhave been efforts to take her out.\n\n\n\nI\nrecently did an interview with her... it\u2019s quite short; it\u2019s\nabout\na half hour. During that interview, the tape and the film \u2013 I\nwas not touching the camera; I just focused on her and stepped\naway \u2013 it was hit by some kind of scalar weaponry... over, and\nover, and over again.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nan amazing thing that certain numbers of our witnesses... the Powers\nThat Be -- whether they are ET, or whether they are using scalar\nweaponry and they are human -- do not want you to hear what\nthey have to say, and she\u2019s one of those people.\n\n\n\nSo,\npay close attention because she says things that may seem very, sort\nof every-day?\nAnd yet she has a certain way of speaking... it\u2019s an\ninteresting phenomenon and suddenly what seem like plain words will\ntake on new import. So, I want to welcome Miriam Delicado. \n\n\nI\nwant to make sure this wire... talk to the crowd. I just want to make\nsure they can hear you.\n\n\n\nMIRIAM\nDELICADO (MD):  Thank you. Whoo! I think they heard the \u201cWhoo!\u201d\nwhen I sat down, maybe. Can everybody hear me all right? [audience\ncomments] No?\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE:\n Yeah, go ahead.\n\n\n\nMD:\n Okay. Well, if I start talking, maybe you can hear me a little\nbit...\n Thank you. I feel like a bit of a diva!\n\n\n\nI\njust want to say that I am extremely nervous. I am shaking.\nIt\u2019s going to take me a few minutes to get through just a\ncouple of words that I wanted to say that are going to make me cry.\nSo, I can get them done and out of the way.\n\n\nFirst\nof all, I want to talk about Kerry and Bill, and I want everyone to\nreally just look around the room and see what extraordinary people\nyou are sitting next to, from all around the world.\n\n\n\nConferences\nare everywhere, but something that I have noticed that\u2019s\nreally special about Camelot and the people that go to Camelot is\nthat you have a deep desire to take action, that you are not\njust filling your minds with this information, but that you are\nasking the question: What\ncan I do... for myself, for my community?\n\n\nThis\nwhole concept of Project Camelot is really, I believe, making an\nimpact on the world, because I most certainly receive emails from\naround the world, from some extraordinarily small places in China,\nvillages in Japan, indigenous people from remote areas.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthe voices that we have at Camelot are very strong and I just want to\nhonor Kerry and Bill for allowing not just me but all of us to have\nthis opportunity to learn and to grow and walk through this process\ntogether. So I just want to say thank you. \n\n\nThe\nsecond thing I want to share on a really personal note is to talk to\nyou about my car accident. Something very significant happened in the\nweek prior and the days prior to that car accident and to me it was\nnot a (quote) \u201caccident.\u201d It was not.\n\n\nIn\nsaying that, I had this happen and it was very shocking to me,\nbecause it came out of absolutely nowhere. I had no precognition that\nanything was going to happen and so when Kerry and Bill found out --\nthey called me from Europe -- they then got on the phone almost\nimmediately and called people in Los Angeles to come to my side.\n\n\n[Voice\ntearful] I could not walk! I could not walk; I could not\nget out of bed; I could not do anything, and I know so many of\nyou are asking me about this and it\u2019s been very difficult for\nme. But I wanted to tell you something really remarkable that came\nout of that, because I was really concerned for myself after the\naccident.\n\n\nKerry\nand Bill swooped in. They sent people to my side and they put me on\ntheir radio program and immediately people were sending me healing\nenergy which I was asking for. They were sending me strength and\nthey were sending me protection.\n\n\n\nSo,\nI feel just overwhelmed with gratitude  to all of\nyou\nbecause by the time two days rolled around, after that \u2013 after\neveryone started sending all these emails and messages to me and\nhealing, and the healers walked in, I got up and I walked.\n\n\n\nI\ngot up out of bed and I walked out of that room that I was in where I\nhad stayed in bed for five days \u2013 I could not get up. I\u2019d\nslept the entire time. It was like I was in a total daze in another\nworld. I barely remember it.\n\n\n\nSo,\nyou healed me. I still have a few problems, but that whole situation\nrolls me into why I am here and what I want to talk to you about\n\u2013 and that is the power that we have in coming together, which\nis the blessing that I always have in my life, of how I get to\nobserve what happens when people make a decision to come together.\n\n\nSo,\nI just wanted to say thank you to all of you and tell you that from\nthis point forward I am doing well and I thank you for all of\nyour support. Now when we talk outside of this room, let us\nreally get to some business because now you all know I am doing\nwell. \n\n\nI am\nhoping that most of you have watched the Project Camelot interviews\nthat I have done and you are aware that I have had extraordinary\nET contacts for most of my life and that I still have those contacts\nup until the present day. So I am going to share some things\nwith you that I have not shared publicly up to this point.\n\n\nI\nonly have an hour. I never write down a speech or know what it is\nexactly that I am going to talk about before I walk into a room,\nso hopefully, I\u2019ll stay on track.\n\n\n\nTwenty-one\nyears ago, when I was taken onboard a craft in the physical body, I\nwas physically taken and walked onboard a UFO, this really amazing\nknowledge was imparted to me about how we are all connected. And, you\nknow, these are simple words: We\nAre All One.\n\n\nIf\nyou were to sit down and meditate for the rest of your life on that\none sentence \u2013\nWe Are All One\n\u2013 you would still never fully understand the concept that we\nARE all One.\n\n\nPeople\nwrite books and they make it complicated and they say we are all\nOne and we are all connected, and all of these things, and they\nmake it complicated. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s very simple.\n\n\n\nWe\nare ONE\nPEOPLE... and that does not mean people in the United States; it\ndoes not mean people in Canada, from where I am from. It\nmeans people all around the world. We are One People and we need to\ntake responsibility for ourselves in our actions for what it is that\nwe are doing to walk into this future that we are heading towards.\n\n\nNow,\nthis is actually one of the main messages that I received from these\nTall Blond ETs in 1988, is that there would come a time when humanity\nwould be walking into a \u201cTime of Choice.\u201d you are\nchoosing right now what future it is that you want.\n\n\n\nWe\ncannot change the world in one day. We cannot change our financial\nsystem in one swoop. We cannot even break it down. We cannot\ndestroy it because it\u2019s what we have.\nSo what can\nwe do?\n\n\n\nI\ndid not listen to all of George Green\u2019s presentation. I\nknow that he talks about the financial situation quite a bit and he\u2019s\nvery knowledgeable. He\u2019s an amazing instrument to be able to\ncome forward and give you this knowledge of the steps that we are\ntaking in order to change the system.\n\n\n\nEvery\ntime an individual makes the decision and makes the choice and acts\non it and becomes responsible to change their financial situation, to\nchange the way that we are living daily life in a monetary\nsystem, the way that we are living life, and with our food\nproduction....\n\n\n\nAll\nof these issues \u2013 and there are many \u2013 when they all come\ntogether in all of those little bits and pieces, it becomes\nthe change that we need to have.\n\n\n\nNow,\ngoing back to the ETs, they said that we would come into this Time of\nChoice, and that was the first part.\n\n\n\nOne\nof the second things that they said is that during this Time of\nChoice a lot of people would become crazy. And let me tell you, if\nyou know people around you... they are losing their minds! I am\ngoing to tell you why they are losing their minds and it\u2019s\ngoing to get a little bit technical.\n\n\nWhen\nI take responsibility for myself, I basically raise the vibrational\nlevel of my physical body and my spiritual body, combined -- those\ntwo things.\n\n\n\nWhen\nI walk out into the world, and I am walking around here at the\nconference and you maybe walk up to me and you feel something, that\u2019s\nthat energy that I am letting flow through me. And you do it as\nwell; every single person does. It flows through us and it\u2019s\nlike walking along and letting droplets fall beside you. It\u2019s\ndrops of my energy that are melting into yours, and with that energy\ncomes information.\n\n\n\nSo\nevery single person here is\nbeing responsible and\nmaking a difference just by sitting in this room and listening to\nthese speakers, because every time you are with other people, you are\nsharing your knowledge here.\n\n\n\nSo\ndo not panic and think that you need to tell everyone everything\nall the time \u2013 because I get this from a lot of people: I\nwant to tell everybody.\nIt\u2019s not necessary. You show them who you are through your\nactions, through your emotions, through your physical body, through\nyour spiritual self. That\u2019s how you make a change.\n\n\nThe\nreason that people are going crazy is because if you have a person\nwho is not willing\nto make this change along with us, who wants to stay in a really\nmaterialistic world and wants nothing but five cars and the\nsuper-mansion and so forth, well, they are not going to be\naccepting this energy very well and it\u2019s going to drive them a\nbit mental.\n\n\nSo\nwhat we need to do is we need to have patience with the people around\nus. This was a really big point that these ETs made with me, is that\nduring this particular time that we are going through... and\nthis is going to be over the course of several years, by the way.\nThis is not going to be ending next year; it\u2019s not going to be\nending in 2012. It\u2019s going to be over the course of the next\n10, 15, 20 years. So buckle down because this is just the beginning.\n\n\nYou\nare the people who are going to lead the others into this new world\nthat we are walking into. So we need to take care of ourselves\nspiritually. We need to take care of ourselves mentally, but with the\nknowledge. It sounds really simple, does not it, but it makes a\nhuge impact.\n\n\n\nI\nknow in my own personal life, which is the only thing that I can talk\nabout, is even if I walk into a room, people know\nthat I am different... I do not have to say a single word.\n\n\n\nAnd\neventually when they find out that I have had these contacts, and\nprior to me being forthright with people about my contacts, with my\npsychic abilities that I have, which are extensive, they would say:\nOh,\nI knew\nthere was something really\nweird about you.\n And they\u2019d go on and on and they\u2019d say: Man,\nnow it all makes sense.\n\n\nThis\nis a very important point that the ETs need people to understand \u2013\nthat it is a personal responsibility of the soul\nthat we need to first and foremost address in order for us to make an\nimpact.\n\n\n\nTwenty-one\nyears ago I am onboard this craft, they tell me, they said: One\nday there are people -- a particular group of people -- that I will\nfind, and that when I do, I will know what to do. \n\n\nAnd\nI did find those people and they are very special people. I\ndo not talk about them very much, but they are the Hopi. I know\nthat the Hopi are only one of these very special people on the\nplanet, one group of them within the indigenous community.\n\n\n\nThese\nindividuals, their physical bodies may have been born here and have\ncome from here, but their actual DNA and structure and form\nof the human body came from what I call \u201cthe last world.\u201d\nIf you would like to call it Atlantis,\nor if you would like to call it Lemuria\nor so forth, you go ahead; I am not going to get into it\nbecause, you know what? Quite frankly, it is not important.\n\n\n\nWhat\nis important is that these people, these indigenous people from\naround the world, when they originally came to this world, \nwere the first people on this Earth. And that they were allowed\nto come here because\nthey were given an opportunity to come.\n\n\n\nThey\nwere asked: Do\nyou want to come and be taken off the planet while we cleanse it of\nthese negative forces that have taken over?\nThey came and they are the stewards of this land, this Earth.\nthey are the caretakers, the original caretakers.\n\n\n\nIf\npeople understood how much struggle these people have around the\nworld to maintain what it is that they have... Yes, they live in\npoverty, and I am not talking about Hopi -- I am talking\nabout everywhere. They live in poverty. They have struggled through\nrepression. They do not have proper schooling. They have a lot\nof problems with the same issues that we have in the rest of the\nworld with alcohol and drugs and so forth.\n\n\n\nBut\nmake no mistake that even through all of that, if you meet an\nalcoholic that is an indigenous person, you still know\nthat they are special if you sit and listen to them. And what is\nthat? It\u2019s their DNA that has come from \u201cthe last world\u201d.\n\n\nThat\u2019s\none of the things that these ETs talked to me about, quite detailed,\nthat during this Time of Choice and during this Time of Change that\nthese people held a key to our future.\n\n\nIn\nthe history of the indigenous people, they have been crushed by\noutsiders \u2013 not just whites \u2013 the outside world, those\nthat have come afterwards, which is the rest of the population.\n\n\n\nThey\nhave their own land. they are protecting the water. they are\nprotecting the Earth. They have certain abilities to work within the\nsystem of the financial system in order to create the new systems. If\nthey have sovereignty, they have the ability to change the monetary\nsystems and create their own banks.\n\n\n\nIf\nthey have their own land, they have the ability to create\neco-villages that are going to be the platforms for a new future. If\nthey have massive amounts of land, then they can begin to build new\nways of farming and producing food that is more productive than\nhaving it the way that we have it right now, which is killing our\nsoil.\n\n\n\nThey\nalso have knowledge about herbs and medicines and healing practices\nthat we can benefit from.\n\n\n\nBut\nlet us be clear on something which is really important. What I am\ntalking to you about sounds as though it came from me reading a book,\nor looking at something over here, or having a conversation over\nthere, but what I am actually talking to you about came directly\nfrom extraterrestrials.\n\n\n\nSo\nI take note of that and I say: All\nright, what can I do in order to assist them? \n\n\nSo\nif you want to make a huge impact and you want to make it quickly,\none of the ways that this community can do that is to find the tribe\nin your area and ask them: What\ncan I do to work with you?\n\n\nyou are\nnot going to be there to help them. We do not help\neach other; we assist\none another. A lot of people try and help,\nand they use their egos and they use another part of themselves, and\nthat does not work. But if you work with\nsomeone, then you leave the ego out of it and you actually accomplish\nsomething.\n\n\nNow,\ntwenty-one years ago, they said there would be a time, and I call it\nthe\nGreat Gathering, the Great Gathering of Humanity. \n\n\n[Comment\nabout how much time she has left has been deleted.]\n\n\nI am\ngoing to share something extraordinary with you. It\u2019s the first\ntime I have shared this publicly and I think it\u2019s time.\n\n\nTwenty-one\nyears ago... and I know I keep repeating myself because I am\nactually a little tired. I had a rough day yesterday, so I apologize.\nWhen they talked about this Great Gathering, they said that one of\nthe keys to this, the biggest key, was the indigenous communities\naround the world coming together, first and foremost.\n\n\n\nSecondly,\nit was the Star Family, the Star Beings that are here in body, like\nmyself and I am sure like a lot of you out there sitting in the\naudience, because we are the ones doing the work. we are\nthe ones making the changes. we are the ones that are not\nworking from the ego \u2013 there\u2019s no place for it here.\n\n\nwe are\nin absolute service, giving up our family lives to a certain degree,\ngiving up our homes, our cars, our financial stability, giving up our\nfriendships that we have had for years in order to work in\nabsolute service for Humanity and for the Earth.\n\n\nSo\nthe indigenous cultures come together. The Star Beings and the Star\nFamily come together. And beyond that, how do we pull everyone else\nin \u2013 the mothers, the children, the grandchildren, the\ngrandfathers? Everyone... the politicians, and I am really sorry\nto tell you this, but the religious leaders from around the world as\nwell.\n\n\n\nI am\nnot interested in talking to someone about how \u201cthis\u201d\nreligion is no good and \u201cthat\u201d religion is no good, and\n\u201cthis\u201d belief is no good and \u201cthat\u201d one. You\nknow what? Every single person on this planet is a human\nbeing,\nand so if we want to make a change, we need to invite everyone\ninto the circle.\n\n\nI\nhad a conversation with someone here last night who was a little\noff-center and they said that they felt as though there were a number\nof \u201calphabet people\u201d [Ed. Note: \u201cCIA,\u201d \u201cFBI,\u201d\n\u201cNSA,\u201d etc.] in the room. And you know what, if there\u2019s\nanyone here along those lines that\u2019s from some sort of an\norganization that does not like what we are doing, you know\nwhat I said to this person?\n\n\n\nI\nsaid: Invite\nthem to sit down with you. Invite them to your table and have a\nconversation with them and teach them something, because that\u2019s\nwhat this is about.\n\n\nBecause\nwhen that person walks away, guess what, they are still in this\nbody. So regardless of what they are being told to do or\ndirected to do, they are still going to be able to hear your\nvoice.\n\n\nSo\nthis Great Gathering is something that I have been waiting a very\nlong time in order to begin working on because that\u2019s exactly\nwhat I was instructed to do, was to talk to people and let them know\nthat this Great Gathering will take place around the world.\n\n\n\nIt\nwill not have a charge . So if you hear\nabout a gathering of indigenous people, if you hear about a gathering\nof other people, and there\u2019s a big charge for the amount of\nmoney that you need to go -- this is not the prophesied Gathering.\nThis is not the Great Gathering, because that is not\nfor sale \u2013 for any charge.\n\n\n\nFor\nsuch a long time people asked me the details of what it is that will\nhappen. I tell them that I have held this vision in my mind for all\nthese years of every man, woman, and child on Earth knowing that this\nevent was taking place, all at the same time or maybe all in the same\nweek, where gatherings around the world would happen in the middle of\na city, in the middle of a village or a small town. The people would\njust gather.\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nthe Gathering does not have to say anything. They just have to\ngather and be peaceful and say: We\nwant a change in this world.\n\n\nYou\nknow, 9/11 was a horrible thing. And again, at this point in my\npersonal world I do not care who created it. What I care about\nand I think about often is the power,\nthe power of humanity because the moment that I saw that tower come\ndown, do you know what I did...? Well, I am sure some of you\nknow what I did \u2013 I cried. I guess I cry a lot... but I cried.\n\n\n\nEmotionally\nI was so distraught and so disturbed because I knew that this would\naffect every single human being on Earth. I cried because I felt, My\nGod! they are going to go to war. This is it. Nuclear war is on\nits way. My God! I\nprayed and prayed and prayed.\n\n\n\nThen\ngatherings started happening around the world, and it was like a\nvigil. And I believe I felt a change happen because my first absolute\nintuition was absolute war, world-wide war. Then as soon as the\ngatherings started happening around the planet, I thought: Thank\nGod! Because it means that these politicians are going to get the\nmessage that nobody wants this big war, that it\u2019s not going to\nbe accepted.\nAnd it\u2019s NOT, and it was not.\n\n\n\n\nSo\nwe minimized the impact on ourselves by creating those gatherings\naround the world and I know\nthis \u2013 for myself, I know this.\n\n\n\nAbout\na year-and-a-half ago in January of 2008, I\nwas instructed...\nI had a telepathic communication with my ETs to meditate, which I\nfinally did... after about three days, I finally had the time to sit\ndown and I meditated. They came to me and they were very, very, very\nclear.\n\n\n\nThey\nsaid they wanted me to do something specific. And I apologize for\nbeing cryptic, but I am often cryptic for reasons.\n\n\n\nThey\nactually asked me to make something, and I said: Okay.\nWhat?\n\n\nI am\nin this mediation and they said: We\nwant you to look at something over here and then we want you to make\nit.\n\n\nI\nsaid: Okay.\n\n\n\n\nThe\nTall Blond was standing right in front of me and I was sort of in\nthis astral world, not really paying attention, going: Okay,\nI am here. What do you want?\nI had to get back out because my mother needed me.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthey said: No!\nPay attention!\n\n\nAnd\nit was like I blinked and then the Tall Blond was standing on my\nright and this object was sitting in front of me.\n\n\n\nThey\nsaid: Make\nthis object,\nand they gave me some instructions with it.\n\n\nThey\nsaid that it was time for the Great Gathering to begin, that the\nfoundations of it need to be started.\n\n\n\nSo\nI said: All\nright!\n\n\n\n\nThey\nsaid: When\nyou return, you must write this down immediately.\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nI said: Okay.\n\n\n\n\nSo\nI came out of the meditation, I sketched it out, and I put it away.\nThat was in January.\n\n\nIn\nMarch I took a trip. I was going to Nevada.\n\n\n\nI\nsaid: Do\nI need to bring it with me?\nThey said: No\n\u2013 very clearly \u2013 No.\n\n\n\n\nI\nsaid: Okey\ndokey.\n\n\nAround\nJuly they said to me that they wanted me to get on the road and make\nthis piece that they wanted me to make, and start laying the\nfoundation for the Great Gathering.\n\n\n\nI\nsaid: Okay.\n\n\nI\nwas looking after my mother at the time, who was aged, and she was in\nthe dying process and I said to them: No\nway. I am not doing it. I am not leaving her.\n\n\nI\nsaid: You\nhave to give me exactly what I ask for, or forget it. \n\n\nSo\nI laid out my demand list! I said:\n\n1)\nMy mother must be taken care of. She must go into a place where she\nis loved and she is taken care of to the highest good, first. \n\n2)\nYou must supply me with the money,\nbecause I had no money.\n\n\n3)\nYou must find someone to make this piece for me because I cannot do\nit on my own. \n\n\nAnd\nthe fourth thing... and I want you to listen very carefully to this\nbecause it\u2019s going to teach you something about the creation\nthat we\nhave the ability to do\u2026\n\n4)\nYou\nmust bring Eagle feathers to\nmy feet.\nI demand a physical proof that what you are asking me to do is true\nand correct, or I will not do this. I must have this come to me\nphysically, or I will not believe that this is real. So I demand\nEagle feathers to my feet AND I demand one white, pure white feather.\n\n\nThis\npiece is carved. A week later (I will not get into all the\ndetails), a carver... I ended up at his house -- no idea that he\u2019s\na carver -- went to his house for some strange reason, walked in the\ndoor. After an hour of conversation he said: I\ndo not know why you are here.\n\n\n\n\nI\nsaid: Well,\nI certainly do.\n\n\nHe\nsaid: Can\nyou tell me why?\nI showed him the piece and he began working on it immediately.\n\n\nTwo\ndays later a stranger PayPal\u2019d $800 to me. Then they PayPal\u2019d\nanother $800 to me. I had $1600 in my PayPal in a week.\n\n\nSomeone\ncalled and said: we have\ngot a bed for your mother; she has to come immediately. I\ncalled an ambulance and took her to the hospital, where she was\nabsolutely loved and taken care of extraordinarily well.\n\n\nAnd\nthe last thing is I walked out of my house to go and water my\ngarden... and I want to stand up for this. I had to go and water the\ngarden, so I pulled the hose and I pulled it because I had to water\nsomething in the far corner. I pulled it and it was, you know, [acts\nout pulling hard] jarring on the hose.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthen I stood there and I had my feet like... \nI was just looking at the garden and then I looked right here [points\nto spot right in front of her feet] literally. Right there. Seven\neagle feathers. Seven Eagle feathers! Can you imagine what went\nthrough my mind at that point, again? But not only that! Not only\nthat, there was one\npure, absolutely\npure white feather sitting in the middle of it.\n\n\nI\u2019d\ntold them: I\ndo not care how you bring these Eagle feathers to me. You can\nbring someone to my door and knock on the door and say: \u201cHere\u2019s\nyour Eagle feathers.\u201d You can leave them at my doorstep. \n\n\nI\nsaid:\nNone of this\nget-in-the-car-drive-five-minutes-get-out-walk-into-the-bush.\n\n\nI\nsaid: I\ncannot do that...\nbecause at that point I could not leave my mother for more than\n20 minutes at a time.\n\n\n\nSo\nI said: You\nmust bring them to my feet. Have one of them fly over and drop them\nin my yard. I do not care.\n\n\nSo\nthe point is that these ETs are still with me and they are very, very\nstrong.\n\n\n\nBut\nwhere did this go? [comment about getting up and walking around\ndeleted]\nHere\u2019s\nwhat happened: I took the piece. I went to Arizona. The message was:\nThe\nGathering, the Great Gathering must begin...\nand I am shaking, I am vibrating all over as I am\nsaying this to you.\n\n\n\nThrough\nthis strange set of circumstances, which I do not have time to\nget into, I ended up talking to someone who said that these people\nfrom South America -- the Mayans -- to be exact were calling on this\nGathering, because they themselves had been receiving messages that\nit was time for the Great Gathering to take place.\n\n\n\nIt\nwas an absolute chance that I ended up having this meeting with these\ntwo individuals and the events leading up to it were extraordinary.\n\n\n\nSo\nthe point is that as I am getting... I am staying in my own\nremote little world. I do not read books. I do not talk to\npeople a lot about the messages that they are getting. I do not\ngo to lectures, that type of thing... to try and keep myself as clear\nas possible. So when I do get a message, it\u2019s powerful. They\nsaid to me that it was time for this Gathering to take place.\n\n\n\nThe\nETs are making contact with people around the world and giving them\nthese messages. they are saying it\u2019s time; that these\npossible cataclysms, these possible earthquakes, volcanoes, you name\nit, solar flares, may come.\n\n\n\nBut\nI really want to stress something to you: We have the ability as a\nhuman\nbeing\nto stop all of that! We have the ability to create with our minds\nwhat we want.\n\n\n\nSee,\nyou can focus on your financial situation, you can focus on your home\n you can focus on the fact that you are not sure where your\njob\u2019s going to come to \u2013 but please do me a favor and\nfocus on what it is that you want\nin the world.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nnot going to be about money. It\u2019s not going to be about power.\nIt\u2019s going to be about the human being again, so you need to\nfocus in on the heart and know that we are moving back into that\ntime.\n\n\n\nI am\nso grateful that people like George Green are taking charge of things\nthat I have no ability to be able to talk on. And that\u2019s the\ngreat thing, also, is that each person that is coming forward right\nnow to speak has a piece of this puzzle.\n\n\nSo\nthe Great Gathering is in the stages of beginning.\n\n\n\nNow,\nI am going to say some things that\u2019ll probably tick off\nsome people, and I am apologizing to them, because if they watch\nthis film... they are not in this room, but if they watch this\nfilm, they will not be very pleased with me.\n\n\nThe\nMayans have begun to come forward and I am sure that many of you\nare hearing about this.\n\n\n\nNow,\nI have contacts in the indigenous world who are not the Mayans \u2013\nother people in the indigenous world. I am not just talking\nabout one tribe; I am talking about several of them.\n\n\n\nThey\ndo not agree with what it is that these Mayans are saying. They are\nnot agreeing with it. They do not believe that saying that the end of\nthe world is coming is the right approach, because it\u2019s not.\n\n\n\nThe\nMayans are the Timekeepers. Well, great \u2013 they are the\nTimekeepers. Do they have so much ego that they cannot believe\nthat the other tribes need to be involved in what it is that they are\ndoing?\n\n\n\nThis\nis not about the Mayans; it\u2019s not about the Hopi; it\u2019s\nnot about the Lakota; it\u2019s not about anyone. What this is about\nis all of them coming together, and coming together in unity to be\nable to have this Gathering, so that we can create this flow of\nchange.\n\n\n\nSo,\nwhen you are listening to things that are coming out right now\ntoday \u2013 right now \u2013 from the\nMayans and from others who are talking about that, I want you to hear\nmy words because:\nIf they want to speak, and if this person, these individuals, choose\nto speak, allow them to do so, but understand that they are NOT\nspeaking for anyone other than themselves and they are not in the\nconsensus of all of them, for their information.\n\n\nAnd\nI thought for a very long time about this, about whether or not I\nshould say something or not, but so many people have contacted me\nwith fear about what these Mayans are saying, and this has never been\nthe intention.\n\n\n\nSo\nthey may have this contact with these Beings. They may have a contact\nthrough Spirit because they did get the message that it was time for\nthe Gathering.\n\n\n\nBut\nin my own personal view \u2013 not in the ET view, but in my\npersonal view \u2013 there\u2019re other issues getting in the way\nof them being able to be as productive as they should be or could be,\nto be as positive, and create the change that we need to have.\n\n\nSo\nmy ET contacts are still very strong and I am blessed by them. I\ndo not see them every day. I do not talk to them all the\ntime. I follow the instructions that they give me and I try to share\nmy insights, my knowledge, my spiritual self, in order to bring some\nsort of understanding to other people.\n\n\nThere\u2019s\na vast amount of areas that I can talk about. You want to talk about\nthe science? I can talk about the science. You\nwant to talk about the\u2026\n[Her comment about she needs to stop walking around for the cameraman\ndeleted] I can talk about the way that the crafts are run and some of\nthat technology, but what does it do for you? Tell me. All of these\ndifferent technologies are out there: zero-point energy, this kind of\nenergy. There\u2019s so much talk about that.\n\n\n\nYou\nnow what? There\u2019s not a single area in your life that does not\nabsolutely reflect right back to these ETs.\n\n\n\nFood\nproduction \u2013 the way that we are planting our food \u2013\nand what\u2019s happening with it right now may have come from\nsomewhere that is not a positive source, through genetic manipulation\nof seeds.\n\n\n\nGet\nyour seeds, your heritage and heirloom seeds, so that we can continue\nto grow our own food. That process is being shut down all around the\nworld and we need to be very, very careful of what it is that we are\ndoing with our own food production because our waters are being taken\naway. Our food is being taken away. Our rights.\n\n\nI am\nin the United States right now and I have great respect for every\nsingle human being on Earth so I do not talk about a particular\ncountry. I talk about Humanity and I talk about People. Every single\nman, woman, and child on this planet has a right\nto have a life, a life that has food, water, shelter, and guess what\nelse? Joy and happiness and love!\n\n\nWhat\nis wrong with us?\n\n\nI\nrecently took a trip to Africa... and I do not know how many of\nyou have seen that movie, District\nNine.\nI went to see that because I like to see what\u2019s being put out\ninto the world regarding this subject matter. I was horrified to see\nthat the living conditions that these ETs were living in...\n\n\n\nHave\nyou been to Africa? Guess what? That\u2019s the way they live! Miles\nand miles and miles of shanties. Not a store, nothing, absolutely\nnothing.\n\n\n\nSo\nwhen you are looking at that, what are you looking at? you are\nlooking at the condition of a human being. What is wrong with this\nworld?\n\n\nI\ncannot change the world in a day. I cannot change the\nattitudes of an entire planet, but collectively as more and more\npeople move into this circle, it starts to spiral and it starts to\nmove.\n\n\n\nWe\nstart to understand that the money that we currently have... if you\nhave $50,000 sitting in the bank, instead of saying: Yeah,\nI am going to buy a car. I am going to get a little\nMaserati...\nactually it probably is not enough for this, is it? I do not\nknow! \n\n\nBut\nif you have a lot of money and you are thinking about that, I am\ngoing to tell you that you are still thinking the wrong way.\n\n\n\nThink\nabout what you can do to your home to help the environment. Think\nabout what you can do in your back yard to plant some food so you\ndo not have to buy it. Think about what you can do to your car\nfor biofuels \u2013 and I am not talking about corn-crop\nbiofuels, because there\u2019s new technologies out there that we\nall need to get on.\n\n\n\nWe\nneed to take action in any way possible and we need to take action\ntogether.\n\n\nWhen\nI started, I said I was healed because of the people in this room and\nthe people from Project Camelot, and I truly believe that, because I\ncould not move! I could barely move. I could not even hold\nthe phone, talking on that interview with Kerry and Bill. I had to\nkind of put it there, put the pillow up and... and I could not\neven hold the phone. And I got up and walked!\n\n\nSo\nthe Great Gathering is coming and what I am going to say to you\nis watch for it and watch for your part in it and how it is that you\ncan help.\n\n\n\nNow,\na lot of people have been contacting me because I put that video out\non Project Camelot. Two things:\n\n\nFirst\nof all, I am putting a whole new website together. There\u2019s\ngoing to be constantly new things coming up on it over the course of\nthe next week, and it\u2019s going to be getting bigger and bigger\nand bigger. So please go and check out my website to find out what\nelse you can be doing, because it\u2019s going to keep expanding.\n\n\nSecondly,\nI want you to know that what you can do, you are already doing, and\nthat is network, network, network, network, because when the call\ncomes out...\n\n\n\nI\ndo not have this confirmed, but I had someone tell me once that\nthe Tiananmen Square\n\n\n...\nwhen that happened -- the Falun\nGong\n(hopefully I said it right), people that follow Falun\nGong\n-- within one hour rallied 10,000 people into Tiananmen\nSquare,\nwhich is why the government in China no longer allows... you know,\nthey are really against Falun Gong.\n\n\nNow,\nbe very careful how you end up using your network. Be aware that you\nare waiting for THE moment to arrive. When this moment arrives and\nyou get the call and it\u2019s time, I would love to see every\nnetwork, whether it is people who are following ETs \u2013 they want\nthe spiritual knowledge; the technology people; people who have the\nprograms for clean water, for poverty...\n\n\n\nAgain,\nI am not really interested in people that are just interested in\nUFOs and ETs, I am interested in everyone. So when that network\ngoes out, it\u2019s not going to be: Oh\nwell, come and join us at the ET gathering\n-- it\u2019s going to be Come\nand join us at the Human gathering.\n\n\nAnd\nso, keep building your network in your personal life to the fullest\nextent that you can and is possible \u2013 which is what we have\nall been doing for the last, you know, how many years.\n\n\n\nSomething\nreally important for myself that I want to say to everyone out there\nis: It\nwould not be possible for me to stand here, or for any of the\nspeakers to be here if it was not for people like you. \n\n\nIt\nwould not be possible for me to stand here personally if it\nwas not possible for all of those individuals who took all of\nthat ridicule, all of the hardships, all of the difficulties that\nthey had.\n\n\n\nThey\nmade it easy for me! Because 21 years ago when I had my contact, my\nbig physical contact 21 years ago, I could not say ET.\nI could not say alien.\nI could not say craft.\nI could not say spiritual\nknowledge.\nI could not say propulsion\nsystem.\nI could not say alien\ntechnology.\nI could not talk!\n\n\nSo\nwe have slowly been building and building and building, and you are\nthe first primary big wave. You have the ability through your voice,\nthrough your heart, through your actions, and through your\nresponsibility, to be able to make the changes that are necessary.\n\n\nAll\nof these things that I am saying to you \u2013 all of them,\nevery single word that I am saying to you \u2013 is not my\npersonal thinking unless I tell you that... and I\u2019ll say it:\nThis\nis what I personally think.\nThese are the messages that were given to me by these ETs \u2013\ndirect messages.\n\n\n\nI\nwish I could take myself and put them into each person just for 5\nseconds and plop\nback out again because man, I am telling you, we\u2019d be on\nfire if we did that!\n\n\nSo\nI am working on a lot of different projects, and I want to also\nsay thank you to everyone for assisting me because if I was not\nassisted, I would not be able to be here right now. And from my\ncar accident, I do not know how I would have gotten home and\ngotten the care that I needed when I was here.\n\n\n\nMy\nfriend who\nwas\nwith me in the car accident is fine. He had a bit of whiplash. He\u2019s\ngot a few issues with his back and neck still and he\u2019s still in\nrecovery as well, but he is feverishly helping me to get this new\nwebsite going and to do a number of different things.\n\n\n\nSo\nI just want to say thank you to everybody for everything.\n\n\nI\nhave no idea how much time I have left, but I want to know if any one\nof you has a question?\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER :  Hi. First, what is the name of your website?\n\n\nMD:\n The new website that\u2019s coming up -- he\u2019s working on it\nright now -- is www.bluestarprophecy.com\n.\n\n\n\nAM\n1:  Okay, one more question. You spoke briefly about Mayans. If my\nunderstanding is correct, according to Drunvalo Melchizedek...\n\n\n\n\nWell,\napparently Drunvalo Melchizedek claims he has been chosen by one of\nthe senior Mayan Councils as a spokesperson for them and I am\nwondering, basically, if you have any comment in regards to some of\nthe stuff that he\u2019s been talking about... if you have any\nknowledge from the inside.\n\n\nMD:\n I have great respect for all indigenous people and the people that\nare coming forward. Drunvalo has been chosen by the Mayan Council to\ncome forward and speak, and that\u2019s their business. That\u2019s\nwhat they are doing right now. The Mayan Council did, in fact,\nreceive messages, and I know this for a fact, to come forward.\n\n\nI\nhave great respect for everyone in South America, including the\nindividuals from the Mayan Council that he is dealing with.\n\n\n\nHowever,\nif you hear the Mayan Council or if you hear Drunvalo \u2013 and I am\nsorry, I am going to be in some hot water over this, I am\nsure \u2013 talk about other tribes, I am not going to say that\nwhat he\u2019s saying is not correct.\n\n\n\nWhat\nI am going to say is: Use\nyour discretion\n-- because the Mayans themselves are speaking on behalf of other\ntribes and I know that these things are not correct. I have to be\ncareful as to how I deal with that, but it is a very\nbig issue\nright now.\n\n\n\nKnow\nthis also, that there are many councils, from what I understand of\nthe Mayans. I have only heard the voice of one man so far.\nMyself, personally... I do not need to be running around talking\nto all these indigenous people, boosting myself up, you know, for\nmyself? I do not need that acknowledgement.\n\n\nWhat\nI need to know is that they are willing to come together without\nego, without ego, and again, without ego.\n\n\n\nSo\nif you are speaking, you are speaking for yourself. If I am\nspeaking, I am speaking for myself. If the Mayans are speaking,\nI ask the Mayans to be respectful and speak for themselves. That is\nwhat I ask for from the Mayans or from any tribe.\n\n\n\nNo,\nthis is not about the individual, whether it is an individual\ncollective or an individual self. This is about unity and the\nHumanity and the heart of all of man. So this issue, for me, has been\nextremely challenging.\n\n\n\nNow,\nsomething in this also... I made a comment that someone from South\nAmerica was doing black magic on me and I know that they were. This\nwas not... because people have asked me about this.\n\n\n\nThey\nsaid: Was\nit George Green?\n\n\nI am\nlike: No,\nit was not George Green!\n\n\n\nYeah,\ncan you see him with the little...?  I\ndo not think so!  It was not George Green and\nit was not the Mayans. So I\u2019ll just leave it at that, but it\nwas someone that I know is doing it. The point in that is yes, just\nbe cautious.\n\n\nAM\n1:  What was the article that you have been created, if you can tell\nus, and\nwhat will its purpose be, and\nwhen do you think the Great Gathering will be?\n\n\nMD:\n The piece itself I cannot talk to you about in detail at this time.\nIt will come forward at a later date.\n\n\n\nThe\nGreat Gathering is in the process of being. It\u2019s always been in\nthe process of being made through networking, through talking to\npeople and through laying foundations. Do I know when it will be? No.\nBut I am going to pray and I ask you all to pray that it will\nhappen as quickly as possible. You\u2019ll all know, believe me.\n\n\nAM\n1:  I know I asked a question before, but why, in your opinion, did\nthey choose you to contact?\nAnd do they want more people to be contacted or do they want more\npeople to continually, actively spread this message?\n\n\nMD:\n Yes.  Why was it that I was (quote) \u201cchosen\u201d? Am I\nspecial? No. \n\n\n\nWhat\nI was is... I am an individual. I am at least in part a\nhuman being, probably more than ET, but I believe I have ET DNA in\nme. My family lineage will go all the way back to the beginning of\nhuman life and the creation of these bodies. This is one of the\nreasons why certain families will have ET contact from generation to\ngeneration.\n\n\n\nSo\nit\u2019s not the individual. It\u2019s whether or not the physical\nbody is strong enough to able to withstand the higher vibrational\nfrequency of what it is that\u2019s coming through. So, did that\nanswer it a little bit?  Darrell?\n\n\nDARRELL:\n Everyone in this audience will want to know... I am a Hopi. I am\nfrom the Four Mesas and Miriam has come to visit us and bring her\nmessage. We appreciate her visit. She brings a message that will help\nus and other individuals on this Earth, in this community. We are\ntrying to develop a good rap\nwith her and\nwe appreciate the information she brings. We are hoping to work\ntogether, share what we can with her, accept what she brings to us.\nWe appreciate it.\n\n\nMD:\n Thank you.\n\n\nDARRELL:\n \n\n\n\n\nMD:\n Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAM\n2:  I want to thank you for bringing your story forward. It\u2019s a\ngreat story. But in your book you mentioned the appearance of a\nSecond Sun. I was wondering if you could briefly comment on that\nsymbol, as it relates to the Gathering.\n\n\nMD:\n I was told that a star would appear in the sky for all of man to\nsee. Nothing or no one would be able to hide its presence from the\nworld, and it would be a sign to the people that the end was near.\n\n\n\nI\nbelieve \u2013 not any other group \u2013 I\nbelieve that the Comet Holmes, last year, was the appearance of this\nBlue Star. For a number of reasons I do believe that it was the Blue\nStar that appeared, and that there will be other signs coming to us.\nWhen I know these signs, I will let you know.\n\n\n\nWhat\nit means is that we are in a window, a time, a Time of Choice, and we\nhave very limited... I am sorry, I should not say limited.\nWe have a number of years, not months but years, before these great\nchanges take place... if\nthey do, because humanity has the ability to change any of these\ncataclysms that might take place.\n\n\n\n[to\naudience] I have time for one more quick, quick question.\n\n\n\nAM\n3:  Could you go into a little about meditation? Like how does one go\nabout meditating?\n\n\nMD:\n Okay. Meditation. I think that what the real question that you are\ntrying to ask me, and you can just nod if that\u2019s correct, is\nhow do you contact these ETs?\n\n\nAM\n3:\n\n\n\n\n\nMD:\n Okay. Because a lot of people ask me about that and Kerry and Bill\nare here, so... When I meditate, I meditate just by laying down, by\nsitting cross-legged, by sitting in a chair. I could be sitting\nacross from you and I could be meditating.\n\n\n\nHonestly,\nmeditation is being made something that it is not. Meditation is not\nabout sitting down for hours and hours and hours a day, it\u2019s\nabout being productive with your meditation. Your meditation should\nbe taking place all day long every day. It should be within your\nheart that you actually mediate.\n\n\n\nSo\nwhen you meditate, the only requirement is to be able to be\ncomfortable, to ground yourself, protect yourself with light, and ask\nyour guides to come to you, whoever it is that they happen to be.\n\n\nNow,\nfor myself, in making contact with the ETs... just because I call on\nthem does not mean that they come to me. They come to me when\nthey can because there\u2019re not enough of them to go around.\n\n\n\nBut\nthey are contacting you\nin a dream, in a vision, in a feeling, in many of these different\nways and they may be coming to you in your meditations and you do not\neven know it.\n\n\n\nSo\nif you want to make contact, what I would suggest to you is that you\ncontinue to ask, and if you want to see a craft, continue to keep\nyour eyes open; there\u2019s ways to be able to see things.\n\n\n\nAnd\nmany people, not a huge lineup, but a fair number of people who have\nbeen around me, and spent time with me, and truly listened to what I\nwas saying to them, and really paid attention to the fact that they\nneed to keep their eyes open, have then ended up having sightings of\ntheir own that they know for sure was craft or orbs.\n\n\n\nSo\nonce you get to my website and everything\u2019s all up, I am\ngoing to be doing videos about how you can do all this because I want\nto get as much information as I can out here.\n\n\n\nAnd\nso, am I done? \n\n\nBILL\nRYAN:  you are done! \n\n\n\n\n\nMD:\n So just before you go... Again, my website\u2019s\nwww.bluestarprophecy.com\n, and I have a couple of books here, and I can take some orders if\nyou want and so forth.\n\n\n\nAgain,\nwhatever we can do in this community... I am going to ask this.\nThey do not even know I am going to say this: If\nyou want to take responsibility and you want to make a difference,\nplease do one thing \u2013 support Kerry and Bill.\n\n\n\n\nBILL\nRYAN:  Thank you.\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\n\n\n\nKERRY\nCASSIDY (KC):  \u2026the trail of the truth for over forty years.\nIf anything, he\u2019s probably the\nexpert. He has spawned most of the researchers you know such as\nZecharia Sitchin and David Icke and so on. He brought them to the\npublic.\n\n\nJordan\nhas not been credited in half the way that he should be \nand I want to do that right here. \n\n\nHe\u2019s\ngiven some of our lead researchers some information and they have\nnever credited him \u2013 okay? \u2013 so you may think it comes\nfrom them and that they are so smart and brilliant. Believe me, they\nwould not be half the place they are today if it was not\nfor Jordan Maxwell.\n\n\nAnd\nso we really want to honor him here today and we are very proud\nto have him speak at a Project Camelot conference.\n\nPresentation begins:\n\n\nJORDAN\nMAXWELL (JM):  Thank you. Thank you very much. \n\n\nI\nthink the one thing I\u2019d like for you to take away from anything\nthat I say today is this one point: that nothing in this world works\nthe way you think it does. Nothing.\n\n\nThe\npolice aren\u2019t who you think they are; the sheriff is not who\nyou think he is; banks do not do what you think they do; governments\ndo not operate anywhere near the way you think they do, and\nthat\u2019s why today, when you look at what\u2019s going on in the\nworld today, none of it makes any sense. It\u2019s all crazy. It\nmakes no sense at all.\n\n\nIt\nseems very destructive, but actually in point of fact, you do not\nknow how the system works. It\u2019s working perfectly fine!\n\n\nThe\nrich get richer and the poor get poorer; the people, the masses, are\nentertained with television and alcohol and drugs and the wealthy\ncontinue to get wealthy. And so, it\u2019s working perfectly fine\nonce you understand how the world really works and nothing works the\nway you think it does.\n\n\nMy\nwhole life I have been interested in theology and religion, and\nthat\u2019s my real love. I have spent all of my awakened hours\nof research throughout the country and throughout the world studying\ntheology and religion -- but not to learn from\nit, but to learn about\nit.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\na fascinating story once you see how our religions came into being.\nYou begin to see things that you have never seen before and begin\nto have questions that never occurred to you before.\n\n\nSo,\nthat\u2019s been my major love. But I also in the early \u201980s,\nvery early \u201980s, came into contact with some people who were\nexperts\u2019 experts on government and banking, and I was in their\ncompany for many years. I learned how governments work, and it was\nabsolutely astounding to me to see the real truth.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\ntaken me 48 years to get here tonight, but I am going to give\nyou a secret that I have learned. I am going to give this to\nyou for free.\n\n\n\nThis\nis a secret and it\u2019s a very powerful secret: Financially,\nand in every other way, people will always support what they want to\nhear. They will not support what they do not want\nto hear.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou like country music, you are not going to pay thirty bucks\nfor a rap concert. If you like a particular movie star, you are\nnot going to go see somebody else. People will always... I mean if\nyou like a particular kind of food, you are not going to the\nopposite restaurant.\n\n\nSo\npeople will always support what they want to hear. Anyone who has\ntraveled and dealt with the public, you will find that the one thing\nthat people, generally speaking, do not want to hear is the truth.\nNobody is happy when they have to be faced with the truth.\n\n\n\nThere\nare some brave people, like maybe you here today, who are at least\nopen to hear something that may conflict with what you believe or\nwhat you know, but at least you are truth-seekers.\n\n\nThat\u2019s\nwhat I have always been, is a truth-seeker.\n\n\n\nI\nalways say I am not the world\u2019s foremost authority on\nanything, because I am at least smart enough to know how much I\ndo not know, but when you begin to break down how government\nworks, banks work, you begin to see a whole world that you have\nnever known.\n\n\n\nThe\nword I use is occult.\nOccult\nsimply means hidden,\nand this is exactly what is going on in the world today. Our\ngovernments, banks, institutions of education, etcetera, are\noperating on a totally occult or hidden basis, and so what we are\ntold and given to understand is not the truth.\n\n\nLet\nme give you an example. How many people have heard me lecture or talk\nabout the maritime system of commerce? Okay, so most people at least\nhave heard about the subject.\n\n\n\nFor\nthose of you who have not, I\u2019ll just give you some\nexamples.\n\n\nWhen\nyou go into court, why do you have to go to court?\nYou play tennis on a court.\nYou play basketball on a court.\nThe whole idea in a court is to put the ball back in the other guy\u2019s\ncourt. So you have a team of lawyers and they throw the ball back in\nanother guy\u2019s court, and that team throws the ball back in the\nother guy\u2019s court, and the judge is a referee, and he does not\ncare who wins or loses. He\u2019s going to get paid anyway.\n\n\nSo\nhe wears a black robe. Black robes... most people never question why\ndo Catholic priests wear black robes? Kids that graduate from high\nschool wear black robes; judges wear black robes; rabbis wear black\nrobes \u2013 because black robes represent the planet Saturn. They\nare a symbol for the planet Saturn.\n\n\n\nSaturn\nwas called by the ancient people \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and\nSaturn is Lord of the Rings.\n\n\nThis\nis why women were told in the ancient world to listen to their god\nand the concept was that they would wear an ear-ring.\n\n\nMen\nwere to get married before their god, so they wear wedding rings,\nbecause the old ancient god of the Middle East, one of the ancient\ngods of the Middle East, was the planet Saturn. Saturn was directly\nconnected to Yahweh, the Hebrew god, so this is why even today the\nJews celebrate the worship of Saturn.\n\n\n\nSaturn\nin the old Phoenician language was called Shabath.\nLook up in the Phoenician language, you will find that the planet\nSaturn was called Shabath\nand his worship to honor him once a week was called Sabbath.\nSo when the Jews are having Sabbath,\nthey are actually paying homage to their god, Saturn, Lord of\nthe Rings.\n\n\nSo\nwhen you start breaking down where religions have come from,\ntheologies have come from...\n\n\n\nThe\nsix-pointed star, for instance, is called the Star of\nDavid. Actually it\u2019s\nnot the Star of David. All the encyclopedias and reference works will\ntell you that it\u2019s called the star of Saturn.\nIt is a hexagram. Hexagrams represented the planet Saturn.\n\n\n\nThen\nwhen you look at the Christian system of things... the church is a\ndisgrace in my opinion. Period. The Christian church is a disgrace.\nEverything that comes out of the Christian church in America is a\ndisgrace. It\u2019s filled with lies, deception, innuendos. It is a\nmoney-making corporation that operates under maritime admiralty law,\nand there is a whole world of knowledge that Christians have not been\ngiven about the scriptures, about who wrote the Bible, where it came\nfrom.\n\n\nI\nhave found that even Judaism is not a B.C.\n[Ed\nnote: \u201cBefore Christ\u201d \u2013 now designated as B.C.E. or\n\u201cBefore Common Era\u201d]\nreligion. It did not exist in the B.C, you know. So, when we talk\nabout ancient Jerusalem,\nthere was no ancient Israel \u2013 Jerusalem, yes \u2013 but no\nancient Israel. So, when you think about how preachers and religious\nleaders talk about ancient\nIsrael this and ancient\nIsrael that, in point of\nfact Israel is not a B.C. religion.\n\n\nThe\nwhole concept of the Old Testament was developed right around the\n9th, 10th, 11th and 12th century A.D., [Ed\nnote: Anno\nDomini,\nor \u201cYear of Our Lord\u201d \u2013 now called \u201cthe\ncommon era\u201d and designated C.E., but begins dating from birth\nof Christ] so that the\nOld Testament is not an ancient\nrecord of an ancient\npeople. There was\nno ancient Israel.\n\n\nTwo\nof the greatest scholars \u2013 archaeologists \u2013 in Israel\nhave written a book called Unearthing\nthe Bible. These two men,\nthese two archaeologists, are the best and the brightest of the\narchaeologists in Israel.\n\n\n\nIn\ntheir book, basically that\u2019s what they have said. There was\nno Moses. There was no King Solomon. There was no King David.\n\n\n\nThe\nentire thing was written probably in the 8th, 9th, and 10th\nCentury\nA.D. in Europe, developed, and ultimately all of that was taken by\nthe Jesuits and the Catholic Church and rewoven into a story and\ngiven to us today as an ancient\nIsrael. There was no\nancient Israel.\nIt never existed.\n\n\n\nThere\nwas no Moses, there was no King Solomon. Solomon\nwas Sol-om-on. Sol\nis Latin for the Sun; Om\nis the Hindu word for the creative force; and On\nis the name of the Sun in Egypt. The Greeks call it Heliopolis,\nbut the Egyptians called the City of the Sun On.\nGo look in the dictionary. Look up the word On.\nIt will tell you it\u2019s the City of the Sun in Egypt. This is why\nyou flip a light-switch on,\nbecause it was a city of light.\n\n\n\nSo,\nyou take Sol-om-on, the three names of the sun in the ancient\nesoteric languages, it becomes Solomon.\n\n\n\n\nEven\nin the ancient Bibles, the old Bibles from the 12th, 13th, and 14th\ncentury, it did not say King\nDavid \u2013 it kept\ntalking about King Druid.\n\n\nAnd\nincidentally, the system of government and laws that we live under\ntoday in America and in the Western world is a druidic\nsystem. America is a druidic country; Canada is druidic. Like I said,\nWestern civilization is a druidic establishment.\n\n\nThe\ndruids were a very powerful priesthood in Europe, even before the\nRoman Empire existed. They were the attorneys, the lawyers, the\nreligious leaders, the politicians. It was called the druidic\nsystem. \n\n\nOne\nof the most important symbols in the druidic system was a magic wand,\nlike Merlin the Magician with his magic wand. Orchestra leaders and\nconductors use a magic wand. That\u2019s a druid symbol.\n\n\n\nThe\ndruid symbol of the magic wand was made out of the wood of a Holly\ntree. It\u2019s made out of Holly\nwood and the entire\nestablishment \u2013 Hollywood \u2013 is a druidic system. So, if\nyou do not understand druidic symbols, you\u2019ll never know\nwhat\u2019s going on in Hollywood, and where they are being\nfinanced, who\u2019s financing them, and how this stuff really works\nin relation to government.\n\n\nThere\u2019s\nan enormous amount of material out on the web showing pictures \u2013\nfrom motion pictures \u2013 from five, six, seven years before 2001,\nbefore 9/11 in which 9/11 is in motion pictures, and the original\nfilm of Matrix.\n\n\nIn\nthe original Matrix\nmovie, the star is given some kind of an affidavit to sign, which is\nhis identification or something, and the camera zooms in on it for\njust a moment when he\u2019s signing it. But if you stop the film,\nstop it and back it up and zoom in, you will see the document is\nabout something that is going to happen. It says September 11, 2001.\nAnd this was way before September 11th,\nbefore 9/11.\n\n\nChris\nCarter. Classic example of what I am talking about... Hollywood.\nChris Carter, the creator of X-files.\nWhen X-files\nended, Chris Carter, the producer, started a whole new television\nseries called The Lone\nGunmen. The very first\nmovie was a lead-off movie for the new television series, and in that\nmovie that came out right around February or March of 2001...\n\n\n\nFebruary\nor March of 2001, Chris Carter\u2019s new television show, called\nThe Lone Gunmen,\nwas started on Fox television. In the very first episode, it\u2019s\ntalking about how factions within the US government were going to fly\n757s into the World Trade Center and knock them down, purposely, and\nin the movie, you are seeing the planes going into the World\nTrade Center.\n\n\nThat\nwas back, you know, eight months before it even happened. Chris\nCarter is telling you something in the movie, and in the movie they\nask: Well, why are these\npeople in the government doing it?\n\n\nAnd\none of the guys in government said: Because\nwe need to control the Middle East. We need to control the oil flow;\nwe need to have a dominant place in the Middle East, so that we can\npromote wars, which is good for business\nand...\nBut that\u2019s in the movie, and it shows the planes going into the\nWorld Trade Center.\n\n\nGeneral\nElectric. About three or four years before 9/11, General Electric\ncame out with a refrigerator in Italy, and on the face of the\nrefrigerator, painted, were two jets flying into the World Trade\nCenter. It shows the World Trade Center and two big planes flying\ninto them, and I have many, many pictures from Hollywood showing 9/11\njets flying into the World Trade Center.\n\n\n\nSo,\nall I am saying is that Hollywood knows what\u2019s going on,\nand this whole thing is being orchestrated from behind the scenes to\nknock down the World Trade Center.\n\n\n\nThe\nday it happened, I became so depressed, I just dropped out of\nspeaking. I no longer toured, I no longer did radio, I no longer\ntalked to anyone, and I have been out of commission for many\nyears because 9/11 just shut me down.\n\n\nAs\nfar as I was concerned, I was through with America. I was through\nwith all of it because any country that can buy three high-rises\nfalling down into dust and not ask any questions about that... I just\ngave up. \n\n\n\n[responding\nto audience]: Yeah. Because I am well aware of how governments\nwork, religions work, and banks.\n\n\nWell,\nlet me give you an example. There are only two things on the Earth;\nland and water.\n\n\n\nPeople\nlive on land so the law of\nthe land is the law of\npeople who live on land. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the law\nof the land. But the law of the land is different in every country\nbecause it\u2019s the law of the people who live on the land. You\ncan do things in Russia  you cannot do in America. You can\ndo things in South Africa that you cannot do in China, so the\nlaw of the land is different in every country.\n\n\n\nBut\nthe law of water is the law of money \u2013 the cash flow, the\nliquid assets. I\u2019ll give you an example of how this works\nbecause when a ship pulls into harbor, it\u2019s coming in on water\nand it\u2019s going to bring products, so all ships by law must be\nfemale. This is why you will always hear a captain saying that she\nis a good ship. She is seaworthy.\nShe,\nbecause all ships are female, and the reason why is because she\nproduces the product.\n\n\nWhen\na ship pulls into harbor, it parks at the dock.\nEach piece coming off the ship has to have a Certificate\nof Manifest, and the ship\n\u2013 where it sits \u2013 is in its berth.\n\n\nSo,\nwhen you were born, you came out of your mother\u2019s water,\nso you have to have a birth\ncertificate and it\u2019s\nsigned by the Doc\nand if you drop the car or the television, it\u2019s a stillborn\nso you have to have a death\ncertificate.\n\n\nSo\nyour body... as a matter of fact, your body is a security on the New\nYork Stock Exchange.\n\n\nIf\nyou take your Social Security card \u2013 and I am not going to\ntalk much more about this because there are other things I want to\ntalk about -- but this, I think, is interesting. If you take your\nSocial Security card, on the back of a Social Security card, you will\nsee a series of numbers. Those numbers on mine are in red and those\nnumbers on the back of the Social Security card represent your\nphysical body on the Stock Exchange in New York.\n\n\n\nAnd\nif you take a bill, any kind of American bill \u2013 whatever it is,\n$10, $20, $100, $1, whatever it is \u2013 you will see a series of\nnumbers here, code numbers, on the bill. You match the numbers on the\nbill with the back of the Social Security card.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nbecause there\u2019s about six-and-a-half-million dollars or more\ncirculating around the world with your Social Security number on the\nbill because your body has a security on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n\nThey\nare buying and selling your personal body on the Stock Exchange in\nNew York. Most people do not understand any of this and have no\nidea what I am talking about, but it\u2019s the way banks work.\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nso I have discovered also that banks and government are basically\nbased on religion. Religion is at the bottom of all of this.\n\n\nThis\nis why I have no respect. I have a respect, a reasonable respect, for\nlaw and order. I am not so stupid as not to understand the need\nfor red lights and the things which are required in law for people to\nlive together, but I have no respect for religion, government,\nbanking, and especially educational institutions, because I know who\nfinances these organizations. I know where the money comes from.\n\n\n\nOur\nbanks were given to us by the Knights Templars, the Masonic Lodge of\nKnights Templars in Europe. Our educational institutions,\nuniversities and colleges, were given to us by the Masonic Order\ncoming out of Rome.\n\n\n\nThis\nis why the square mortar-board is a Catholic symbol. And Jews... how\nmany Jews know that when you wear a yarmulke, that\u2019s not\nJewish? That\u2019s Roman. That\u2019s why the Pope wears the\nyarmulke. That\u2019s why the Cardinals wear the yarmulke. It\u2019s\na Roman symbol; it\u2019s not Jewish.\n\n\nThe\nJews were told to wear the yarmulke to show subjection to Rome and\nthey got so used to using it they think it\u2019s a Jewish symbol.\nIt\u2019s not Jewish.\nIt\u2019s Roman.\n\n\nAnother\nthing that bothers me, too, when it comes to religion \u2013 there\nis a world of difference between being anti-Semitic\nand anti-Jewish.\nIt does not mean the same thing at all.\n\n\n\nSo\nwhen you hear someone use the term anti-Semitic\njust remember that there\u2019s four kinds of Semitic: north, east,\nsouth and west Semitic. And there are 13 different races of people in\nthe world that are Semitic. The Arabs are Semitic.\n\n\n\nSo\nwhen you say someone\u2019s anti-Semitic,\nit means that they are against 13 races of people in the world, 13\nnations. When somebody says something about Jewish,\nit\u2019s anti-Jewish,\nnot anti-Semitic.\n\n\n\n\nSo\nit\u2019s just a small point but it\u2019s big with me because\npeople use terms and they use the wrong terms and do not\nunderstand what they are saying.\n\n\nReligion,\ngovernment, educational institutions: I have found that so many\npeople willingly... and as I said last night on this forum, so many\npeople willingly bend themselves to what their masters want from\nthem. What your masters want is for you to be in compliance, for you\nto think what they have told you to think.\n\n\nI have\nbeen behind the cameras in national television studios and watched\nnetwork news people doing their job. What most people do not realize\nis on the nightly news from the networks, when you see the newsman\ntalking directly to you, he\u2019s talking right into the camera\ngiving you the news. In point of fact, that\u2019s not what\u2019s\nhappening.\n\n\nThere\nis a big box, a large box with a television screen on the bottom, and\nthere\u2019s a glass, a clear glass on an angle, and there\u2019s a\nguy sitting off to the side typing, or it\u2019s already typed.\nthey are telling the newsman what to say, word for word. And so\nthe television screen is hitting this glass and it\u2019s reflecting\nstraight out so that the newsman can sit right there and look\ndirectly into the camera and read the news.\n\n\nSo\nhe\u2019s just reading what somebody else wrote, and that guy wrote\nit because the boss told him what to write. The news is nothing more\nthan what somebody higher up wants you to believe.\n\n\nSo\nthat\u2019s why I have no respect for the news. I do not watch\ntelevision. I am not interested in Hollywood or movies as such,\nbut there is a lot of interesting stuff in movies.\n\n\nGovernment:\nAgain I say, and it\u2019s just my belief, I believe government\nboils down to the war between the Crips\nand the Bloods.\n That\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s just one gang is\nsuperior to another gang, unless of course that other gang gets a\nlittle more money and gets a little bit more vicious; now they take\nover town. So it\u2019s a war between gangs.\n\n\n\nBecause\nafter all, when it\u2019s all boiled down, it boils down to one\nthing: we are all human, and humans, like Martin Luther King\nsaid: People are\norganizations.\n\n\nMartin\nLuther King said organizations are a lot more naughtier than\nindividuals. Individuals can be bad and corrupt, but when you get a\nwhole bunch of individuals bad and corrupt and they are wearing\nuniforms and wearing badges, now you have got a gang.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthe police department even have said that. They tell me things like\nthat: You know, we are\nthe biggest gang in town. we are legal. We can do whatever we\nwant.\n\n\nSo\nI understood a long time ago that government is simply gang warfare.\nWho\u2019s going to run this town? What family in the mob is going\nto run this area of the town? So that is why I have no respect for\ngovernment, banking, or any of the rest of it.\n\n\nI\ncould go on about so many different things that I am interested\nin. Again, like I said, religion is a big thing with me.\n\n\n\nI\nbelieve that the story about Jesus in the New Testament... it\u2019s\njust my opinion, but I believe that that story is an encoded message.\nIt\u2019s a metaphor. It does not represent history as such but it\nis a very powerful encoded story.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou understand the symbols and the words that are used in the New\nTestament in the story of Jesus and understand that the entire story\nis a metaphor, you read between the lines and begin to see that\nthere\u2019s symbols, and ideas are being expressed and you did not\neven see it.\n\n\nA\nclassic example is, why did Judas go out and kiss Jesus? \u2013 just\nan example. In the Bible we are told that Judas went out and\nkissed Jesus. Christians will tell you: Well,\nthe reason why he did that was to identify him so that he could be\narrested.\n\n\nNo.\nLogic alone would tell you that\u2019s incorrect, because Jesus\nwould not have been living in the south side of Chicago or the north\nend of New York. He would have been living in a little Mickey Mouse\nlittle village, probably 300 people there at the most, 15 to 20\nminutes to walk across the whole town.\n\n\n\nAnd\nso how could he be hiding? Who would be so stupid as to not know who\nhe is? He\u2019s sitting out there in the garden with his followers,\nso what do you need to go out and kiss him for\u2026 to identify?\n\n\n\nWell,\nthat\u2019s not what the Bible says. It does not say he went\nout to identify.\nIt says Judas went out and kissed Jesus to\nbetray him, not identify.\n\n\n\n\nThis\nis why the Mafia, when you are going to be killed, they give you\nthe kiss of death.\nIn the ancient world in the Middle East, when a scorpion bites you it\nleaves two cuts on your skin, and those two cuts look just like human\nlips, so the ancient people said you have been given the\nkiss of death.\n\n\nThis\nis why when the mob\u2019s going to whack you, they give you the\nkiss of death, right? It\u2019s because the scorpion is a\nback-biter.\n\n\n\nJesus\nrepresents in the story a symbol. It\u2019s a metaphor, and Jesus is\na metaphor for the sun. And so, boiling it down, Christianity is sun\nworship based on astrology, because nobody owns the sun. Africans\ndo not own it, and we do not own the sun, so obviously the\nsun belongs to God \u2013 so it\u2019s God\u2019s sun\n and he\u2019s\nthe light of the world.\n\n\n\nOf\ncourse the sun\u2019s the light of the world. What else lights the\nworld if it\u2019s not the sun?\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nhe has twelve helpers. Yeah, of course, the twelve signs of the\nZodiac, the twelve months of the year.\n\n\n\nHe\nis our risen savior. Of course; it rises every morning about 5:30,\nand the sun is\nyour savior. If it do not come up, we are dead.\n\n\n\nSo\nonce you start breaking down the symbols in the New Testament, you\nbegin to see that Christianity is basically Astrology and sun\nworship, but it has been so well hidden and so cleverly disguised.\nOnce you start breaking it down and reading the whole story, it\nbecomes overwhelmingly obvious that this is what we are talking\nabout.\n\n\nHe\nhas a virgin birth; he\u2019s born of a virgin -- of course virgin\nbirth, because one of the constellations of the Zodiac is Virgo,\nVirgo the virgin.\n\n\n\nLet\nme give you an example of how this works. On the first day of summer,\nthe very first day of summer, the sun is as high in the northern\nhemisphere as it\u2019s going to go. It does not go any further\nnorth.\n\n\n\nThe\nfirst day of summer, the sun is high in the northern hemisphere and\nit begins to work its way south. Each day it moves one degree, and as\nit moves one degree each day, 90 days later or 90 degrees later, it\u2019s\nhalf-way down. So now we say that the sun was the Lion\nKing in summer, the Lion\nKing because the sun was in the constellation of Leo... the Lion King\nfrom Disney.\n\n\nBut\nthen as the sun moves southward it finally hits Scorpio. So God\u2019s\nsun\n was\nreally hot. He was the Lion King but now he\u2019s falling,\nso now we call that fall\nbecause he\u2019s fallen,\nand he\u2019s falling\nsouth, so it moves into fall\nin Scorpio.\n\n\nThis\nis why Judas gives Jesus the kiss\nof death because Judas\nrepresents Scorpio and Scorpio gives God\u2019s sun\n, the\nlight of the world, the kiss of death and now he\u2019s going to die\nin Capricorn. He\u2019s going to die and go all the way down.\n\n\n\nBut\nwhat\u2019s interesting about this is that the sun goes all the way\ndown south until it hits what is called the Winter Solstice and\nthat\u2019s on December 22nd.\n\n\n\nThe\nsun hits the lowest point on the sky in the south on December 22nd.\nIt\u2019s called the Winter Solstice, the beginning of winter, and\nfor three days... the United States Navy will show and explain it to\nyou, that the sun comes up for three days, the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th\non the same degree. It does not go any further south and it\ndoes not come back north.\n\n\n\nOn\nthe same degree that it was on on December 22nd, the sun rises the\nnext two days, 23rd and 24th, on the same degree. So the ancient\npeople said that the sun\n was\nalive. It was the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Leo, who got the kiss\nof death from Scorpio, and now for three days he\u2019s not moving\nat all, so therefore he\u2019s in his tomb for three days.\n\n\n\nThen\non the 25th of December, the sun moves one degree northward, and you\ncan calculate that as the Navy does. You can calculate it. It\u2019s\nvery slight, but if you have got the right instruments you can\nsee the sun move one degree northward. Therefore, it came\nback to life.\n\n\nSo\nnow we celebrate God\u2019s sun[and/or\nson] being born again.\nHe\u2019s born again. When? On December 25th, so we celebrate\nChristmas or Christ Mass.\n\n\n\nAs\nthe sun moves back towards the northern hemisphere, it crosses over\nthe equator at spring\nbecause he was dead in winter now he\u2019s springing\nback to life.\n\n\n\nSo\nas he comes back to life and crosses over the equator there was a\ncelebration called the Passover\nbecause the sun has passed\nover the\nequator, coming back to the northern hemisphere.\n\n\n\nSo\ntoday when someone dies we say: Grandmother\npassed last night.\nGrandfather passed away,\nor they\npassed on; but always\npassed\nwas associated with death. So God\u2019s sun\n has\npassed over\nthe equator.\n\n\nSo\nonce a year around the world the Jews celebrate the Passover, which\nis nothing more than the sun passing over the equator.\n\n\n\nChristians,\nof course, cannot do that because that\u2019s Jewish and they\nwould not want to have anything to do with the Jewish\ncelebration, so Christians have a totally different celebration. They\ncall it the Resurrection\nof God\u2019s son.\n\n\n\nAnd\nso they go out on the Passover and go out and have something called\nthe Easter sunrise\nservice. So you actually\nhave Christians going out and waiting for the sun\nto come up for something called a sunrise\nservice. I mean, what is that all about? Christians are worshipping\nthe sun?\n\n\n\nAnd\nthen when you start looking at how the word S-O-N\nand S-U-N\nare interchangeable in Christianity... and God knows there\u2019s a\nlot of information on that. So basically you boil down Christianity\nas sun worship / Astrology.\n\n\nThe\nOld Testament is Astrology / sun worship. Yahweh, as I said, was\nassociated with the sun and the planet Saturn.\n\n\nLet\nme give you another example about the ancient religions of the world.\n\n\n\n\nMoses\nwas a lunar deity. Moses was the leader of the Moon cult. This is why\nin all the paintings and sculpturing in Europe you always see Moses\nwearing horns. Have you ever seen that? Moses wearing horns? It\u2019s\nin the Vatican. It\u2019s in all the museums of the world.\n\n\n\nWhy\nis Moses always pictured with horns? Because Moses was the leader of\na lunar cult, the Moon worshippers. So at one time the Jews were\nworshippers of the Moon and that period of time we call the period of\nMoses.\n\n\nThis\nis why the Native Americans, their chiefs wore horns. The Vikings\nwore horns, because all of these cults, cultures \u2013 Native\nAmericans, Vikings, and the ancient people of the Middle East \u2013\nworshipped the Moon.\n\n\n\nThe\nMoon, of course, in the lower quarter was the horns, and this is why\nthey wore horns.\n\n\nIn\nArabia there\u2019s a high mountain range and at night from the\nEgyptian side, the Moon comes up in the east. It comes up from a\nmountain range, and so the ancient peoples believed that the Moon was\na god and that it lived in the mountain and so their religious\ncelebrations of the Old\nMan of the Mountain, the\nMoon god.\n\n\n\nIn\nthe ancient Arabic system the Moon god was called Sin,\nS-I-N.\nThat was his name. The Moon god of Arabia was Sin,\nand a mountain in the ancient language a mountain was spelt A-I.\nSo you take a mountain \u2013 Ai\n\u2013 with the god who\nlived in the mountain, the Moon god \u2013 Sin\n\u2013 and put it together and it becomes Sin-Ai.\n\n\n\n\nSo\nyou get all the... Moses goes up into Sinai. No. It\u2019s Sin-Ai,\nthe mountain of the Moon god. This is why Jews have their celebration\nafter sundown, because that\u2019s when the Moon comes out.\n\n\n\nThey\ndo not have their celebration during the day because that\u2019s\nwhen the sun\u2019s out, so that\u2019s the time for Christians to\ncelebrate God\u2019s sun\n. The Jews\nare worshipping the Moon god, Sin.\n\n\nSo\nI do not intend to... I am not trying to offend anyone, but\nI am just trying to tell you where religions come from.\nReligions have been given to us by the same people who gave us our\ngovernment, our banks, our educational institutions. Our whole entire\nruddy system in Western civilization is based on religion, politics,\nsex, drugs, and rock \u2018n roll.\n\n\nIt\u2019s\njust business.\nIt\u2019s just money. It\u2019s just the control of people.\n\n\n\nAnd\nif you think it\u2019s crazy when I say sex,\nyou have no idea in the world how sex plays a part in everything. The\nvery fact that a man wears a black robe... that\u2019s a feminine\ndress... and, god, there\u2019s so much you could talk about with\nthis subject of sex in religion. I mean, the whole thing is based on\nsex.\n\n\n\nThe\ncross is a sexual symbol. Even in Egypt, the Egyptian obelisk; the\nEgyptian obelisk is... like the Washington Monument, for instance.\nThe Washington Monument has an Egyptian obelisk. An obelisk\nrepresented a male phallic in the erection and the male phallic is\nconnected to the female ovaries. It\u2019s called the oval\noffice, right? \n\n\nAnd\nthe water down... the water strip... is her water, and so when her\nwater breaks the male phallic connects to the female ovaries, the\noval office. Sexual symbols everywhere.\n\n\nA\nsix-pointed star, a star of Saturn.\n\n\n\nSo\nthe point I am making is that our institutions around the world,\nespecially in Western civilization, are based on symbolism, lies,\ndeception, manipulation of our thinking.\n\n\n\nAnd\nsomewhere along the line, if you are really looking for truth \u2013\nand most people aren\u2019t... Like that movie, when the... who was\nit? Tom\u2026  Yeah, in the movie... Anyway,\nthe kid says he wants the truth and the other guy said: You\ncannot handle the truth.\n\n\n[The\nmove is \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d with Tom Cruise and Jack\nNicolson locked in a classic court battle over the truth.] I believe\nthat\u2019s exactly right. I do not think that the world of\nmankind can handle the real truth about how the world really works.\n\n\n\nYou\nknow, I said last night that I believe that democracy is the very\nworst possible form of government on the Earth. I do not think\nyou can get a worse government than democracy.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthe reason I am saying that, I can clarify it now. First of all\ndemos\nin Greek is a mob.\nThat\u2019s why when a mob is out in the street with plaques,\nranting and raving, we call it a demo-stration.\nA demo-stration\nis... demo\nis a mob of people.\n\n\nAnd\nso demo-ocracy\n\u2013 ocracy\nis the rule.\nSo the rule of the mob is democracy. True democracy is 45 whites\nhanging one black. That\u2019s democracy. We\nall voted and one guy\u2019s got to die. We all voted. It\u2019s\ndemocracy. \n\n\nNo.\nAmerica was founded as a Constitutional Republic. A Constitutional\nRepublic means there is a set rule of laws that everyone abides by,\nand it was set up in such a way as to protect the person, the\nindividual, from the mob.\n\n\n\nYou\nknow, down south where I come from, the Ku Klux Klan, they could pick\nout anybody they want, and there\u2019s 45 of them and they take you\nout and hang you and who\u2019s going to say anything? It\u2019s\nwas a democracy; we all voted, and therefore it must be legal.\n\n\nNo.\nAmerica was set up as a Constitutional Republic, which means the\nConstitution was a law and everyone, no matter who it is in the\ncountry, had to abide by the law and it protected you as an\nindividual.\n\n\nThe\nbiggest problem with a democracy is very simple, if you just think\nabout it. Democracy means mob\nrule. It does not\nmatter what the law says.\n\n\n\nAnd\nincidentally I want to throw this out to you. We hear all the time\nthat America is the land\nof laws; we are a country\nbased on law.\nIn point of fact, that is not true. In point of fact, it is just the\nopposite. America is the most lawless country on the Earth. Period.\nThere is no law in\nAmerica.\n\n\nThink\nabout that, what I just told you: There\nis no law in America.\nWhat we have here is whatever the judge says it is, and whatever the\njudge says it is, that\u2019s what the law is.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou go to a different court, and a different judge, but the same\nidentical information, facts, and figures, he\u2019ll maybe give a\ndifferent verdict. Well,\nthat\u2019s what the law says; that\u2019s the law.\nNo, that\u2019s not the law. It\u2019s what that guy said.\n\n\nI\nlearned all of this when I was traveling around, going to the\ndifferent churches and different cults. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are\na classic example. I could use the Mormons as a classic example. I\ncould use any of these churches as classic examples of what I am\ntalking about.\n\n\n\nThere\nis no set law in any religious organization, in the church, or any\ncult, or any group, or any political group. It\u2019s whatever the\nboss in that particular group says it is \u2013 that\u2019s what\nthe law is.\n\n\n\nAnd\nso, even in Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses they will have the elder in\nthat church will tell you: Well,\nhere\u2019s what the Bible says and here\u2019s what the law is.\nNow, if you go to a different one, he\u2019s was like: Oh\nthat guy\u2019s full of bull. Here\u2019s what the real thing...\nhere\u2019s the real...\n\n\nAnd\nthen you understand it does not matter where you go, in any\nMormon church, in any Seventh Day Adventist church, any\nChristadelphian, any World Wide Church of God, any cult, any rabbi,\nany synagogue... it does not matter. Whoever is in charge of\nthat one particular church where you are, that\u2019s the law.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on in America. It does not\nmatter what the actual law books say. You cannot go into a court in\nthis country and win on the basis of facts. That is the facts of\nlife. You cannot win in a court in America on the basis of facts.\nPeriod.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\njudge do not give a damn about the facts. He\u2019s the boss\nand in this court he calls the shots.\n\n\nWell\nyeah, but the other judge said... \n\nI\ndo not care what the other judge said. This is my court and I\ncall the shots, so I will decide. If I kind of like you maybe I\u2019ll\ngive you a break. If I do not like you maybe I\u2019ll add ten\nyears. Now what are you going to do about it? \n\n\nYou\nsay: Yeah, well, but the\nlaw says...\n\nNo,\nno. do not bring that up. This is my court. I call the shots.\n\n\nTherefore\nthere is no law. America is a land of lawlessness.\n\n\nIn\nthe Bible in the Book of Revelations, it talks about the\nrise of the man of lawlessness,\nand I have often wondered about that. It is very interesting... a\nlot of interesting, important stuff written in the Bible if you know\nwhat you are looking at.\n\n\n\nBut\nit talks about in the Book of Revelation the rise of something called\nthe man of lawlessness\nand I used to wonder what in the world was that all about, because\nAmerica\u2019s got so many laws. we have got thousands of law\nbooks. That\u2019s all we are: we have got law books, so how can\nthere be a man of\nlawlessness that would\nrise in the world?\n\n\nWell,\nnow I understand. America is the home of the man of lawlessness.\n\n\nGeorge\nBush could not care less what the Constitution says, the Bill of\nRights... it just do not matter. He\u2019s the boss and\nwhatever he says do, that\u2019s what you are doing. You say:\nBut the law says...\nThey do not care and if you bring that up again, you are\ngoing to jail. Why? Because he represents the Vatican.\n\n\n\nThe\nBush regime was front for the Vatican \u2013 the most important\nenemy this country has today. People will never understand it, but\nthe biggest enemy that this nation today has is the Vatican. The\nVatican is behind the crap that\u2019s going on all over.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\ndo you think the Founding Fathers, whatever we call them, the\nFounding Fathers... Where did they come from, the people who founded\nthis country? They came from Europe. Well, for 2,500 years Rome,\nunder the Caesars of Rome, and then after the fall of the Caesars in\nthe 4th century, and with the coming of the Vatican in the 5th\ncentury, all of Europe has been dominated for over 2,500 years by\nRome. And Europe has dominated the world for 2,500 years.\n\n\n\nSo\nI am saying that if you want to find out who the real enemy of\nthis country is, you\u2019d better start looking at the Holy Father\nand you\u2019d better start finding out the connection between the\nVatican and the Nazi party of Adolf Hitler.\n\n\n\n\n\nKC:\n Thank you.

Thank you.\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nKERRY\nCASSIDY (KC):  Alfred Webre is the originator of the term\n\"Exopolitics\u201d -- for those of you that do not know that,\nand he's actually a \"futurist\"; he's an amazing thinker. He\nwas in this field doing things and thinking things before most people\nhad any idea, even in UFOlogy, how to really think about this whole\nconcept that we are not alone in the universe. So I just want to give\nkudos to him and really honor him for that.\n\n\n\nHe's\nalso been...um\u2026how do I put this? He's undergone heavy-duty\nsurveillance and other kinds of things.\nHe is Canadian, but obviously, he was on the target list for the\nPowers That Be for quite a long time, and actually, he's had to\nweather all kinds of stuff that he does not even talk about. I know\nthis because of my intuitive ability, but also because I followed his\nwork, actually, long before Camelot. So I just want to really honor\nhim for that.\n\n\n\nOther\nthan that, I think we can just give him the microphone and let him\nbegin to talk \u2026 because he's very knowledgeable in so many\nways.\n\n\nKC:\n  Are you hooked up here with this?\n\n\nALFRED\nWEBRE (AW): Yes, am I?  \n\n\n\n\nThank\nyou very, very much, Kerry, and I want to thank Project Camelot who\nare really providing, I think, in my humble opinion, a leading edge,\nif not THE leading edge platform for whistleblowers to come forth on\nthe issues that will create a positive future for us.\n\n\n\nAnd\non that note, that's the note that I'll be sharing with you in a\nPowerPoint on Solar Cycle 24. Solar Cycle 24 is the one that's just\nstarting now \u2013 2009 to 2020, and\nby 2020, we will be roughly into the beginnings of a Golden\nAge. So, I know that it's very hard to go from \u201cthe problem\nstatement\u201d to a Golden Age, but that's roughly the\nprocess that we are in now.\n\n\n\nIf\nwe look at Solar Cycle 24, which we will be seeing all the graphs and\npictures of, the solar maximum will be in 2012 to 2013,\nspecifically, some say, in May of 2013. What that means \u2013 and\nwe will share some of this \u2013 is that there's the Index of\nHuman Excitability which has been plotted by a Russian scientist\ngoing back to 500 BC. What he's plotted is that about 80% of the\nrevolutions, the wars, and the breakthroughs in human society at the\ncollective level, happened at the solar maximum.\n\n\n\n[Kerry\nand Alfred spend a few minutes testing the PowerPoint] Thank you,\nKerry.  Thank you.\n\n\n\nWell,\nas we were saying, this presentation... and there are about 60 slides\nhere, so I'll tend to go through them on a relatively quick basis,\nfollowing the trend from 2009 to 2020, and we will be going kind of on\na macrocosmic scale on much of this.\n\n\n\n[slide\nof Milky Way] That's the picture of our own Galaxy, the Milky Way\nGalaxy, and we will also be getting into the axis of which is a\nGalactic Center black hole at the center of our Galaxy. And now it\nturns out that science is discovering, as you might have suspected, a\nuniversal axis... not only a galactic axis but a universal\naxis.\n\n\n\nSo\nthe synchrony that we are going through now is occurring, not only at\nthe individual level, at the planetary level, at the solar level, at\nthe galactic level, but at the universal level.\n\n\n\nSo,\nit's not only just us here \u2013 it's HUGE! And the universe is\nreally the source of our thoughts. We just think that we have private\nthoughts, but it's coming at the galactic level and at the universal\nlevel. So, one message for that is - RELAX and ENJOY IT! [laughs\nalong with audience]\n\n\n[Slide\ntitled: Exopolitics:\n2009 \u2013 2020, Solar Cycle & A Golden Age,\nAlfred Lambremont Webre, JD, M.Ed. www.exopolitics.com\nshowing the topics listed below.]\n\n\nNow,\nwe will be covering:\nI.\n Solar Cycle 24, which is a perfect storm\nII.\nGalactic Alignment\nIII.\nExopolitics & the Time Acceleration Matrix.\n\n\n\nTime\nis actually accelerating as we speak, as we sit here, because time is\nnot a constant; and Exopolitics is the new political science of outer\nspace. It\u2019s the science of relations between our human\ncivilization and other civilizations in the multiverse.\n\n\nwe will\nbe talking about:\nIV.\nPositive Outcomes of Solar Cycle 24 and\nV.\nStrategies & Solutions\n\n\n[slide\nof NASA data] Well, welcome to Solar Cycle 24, 2009 to 2020. There\nare many predictions of what the amplitude of Solar Cycle 24 will be,\nas you can see from this graph by NASA. Some think that it\u2019s\ngoing to be very low amplitude and some think that it\u2019s going\nto be very high amplitude \u2013 so we are in a position of\nmaximal uncertainty now.\n\n\n\nAlthough\nsome information about Solar Cycle 25 is coming in, most of the\npredictions are only within this cycle, that is, 2009 to 2020, and so\nI like focusing, amongst many other reasons, on Solar Cycle 24 (2009\n\u2013 2020) because it gets us out of the 2012 meme and\nsays: Hey, it\u2019s a cycle. \n\n\nOkay.\nRight now we are in a deep solar minimum and there\u2019s\nabout a 50-year low in solar wind pressure. What this means is that\nthere will be fewer geomagnetic storms that theoretically can affect\nall the computer equipment and satellites and other things that we\nhave here on Earth.\n\n\n\nWe\ncontinue to be in a deep solar minimum and the Sun\u2019s brightness\nis dropping. we are in the deepest solar minimum in\nnearly a century.\n\n\n\nSunspot\nmagnetism, which you can see plotted there on the graph, is on the\ndecline. It may be that sunspots will be increasing because\nwe are in such uncertainty. You can remember seeing from the\ngraph at the beginning that sunspot cycles may be picking up by the\nend of 2009, to be followed by a solar maximum of below-average\nintensity in 2012 or 2013.\n\n\n\nHowever,\nthere's another view of this and that is that if the Sun continues to\nbecome more quiet, we will be going into a territory of historic\nminimum and a quiet Sun will cause temperatures globally to take\na nosedive. This is contrary to the global warming argument. \nSo, we are in a period of maximum uncertainty.\n\n\n\nIf\nthis version is coming forward, which there\u2019s some basis for\nit... Temperatures are actually falling around the globe, not getting\nwarmer, and we know already that from 1998, the lower troposphere\ntemperatures globally have fallen around half a degree Celsius due to\nthe quiet Sun. So it's necessary to go deeper than the \u201cglobal\nwarming\u201d headlines to really understand the dynamics.\n\n\n\nHowever,\nif we do have a Dalton Minimum or a Maunder Minimum,\nwhich are referred to historically \u2013 low Sun minima \u2013\nthe main effect will be to have famine and starvation worldwide due\nto shortened growing seasons and harsher weather.\n\n\n\nAnd\nso, we may be headed into what is called a mini ice age \u2013\nand we do not know \u2013 and we are at 2009. So that's the degree of\nuncertainty. It's the principle: The more you know, the more you\ndo not know. \n\n\n\nSo,\nsome of the evidence is that Solar Cycle 25, which will be peaking\naround 2022 (it starts in 2020) could be one of the weakest\nsolar cycles in centuries, and that's connected to a possible mini\nice age. That's because the conveyor belt system on the Sun is\nbeginning to weaken.\n\n\n\nNow,\nin the midst of all this, we have a National Academy of Sciences\nreport from January \u201909 which says that 2012 to 2013, the solar\nmaximum, may actually bring the perfect storm... in other\nwords, solar flares and systems collapse of our current\ninfrastructure around the planet \u2013 our energy infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe\nNational Academy of Sciences report looks at the possibility that if\nwe do have a repetition of the 8-day 1859 Carrington Event \u2013\na very large solar flare that essentially destroyed the telegraphic\nsystem worldwide, which was the electrical system at that time \u2013\nin the US the damage could be as high as $2 trillion, with millions\ndead (this is from the report itself), and it's questionable whether\nthe US would ever bounce back. Now, we are talking about 2012 to 2013.\n\n\n\n\nMoreover,\nNASA has now discovered that there's a hole in the Earth's magnetic\nfield which is ten times as large as was previously thought. The\nmagnetosphere is what protects the Earth from the impact of solar\nflares, and it could be that up to 20 times the amount of solar\nplasma could enter the Earth than before. So we have a\nforce-multiplier of a solar flare with a hole in the magnetosphere\nhere... looking at the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d.\n\n\nwe are\nlooking at a solar maximum which will be around May of 2013, and one\nscientist says: It's the perfect sequence for a very big event if\na solar flare should load the magnetosphere with plasma just before a\nsolar storm occurs.\n\n\nWe\nhave to remember that we are in a deep solar minimum, which\ntends to lessen solar storms, so there are all these variables that\nare occurring at once.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a map from the National Academy of Sciences study which shows\ntotal collapse. The orange areas on both coasts show the total\ncollapse of the electrical grid, and the red  are vulnerable\ntransformers. This is where the estimate of \"millions dead\u201d\nhas come from \u2013 knocking out about 300 key transformers,\ncutting power to 130-million people.\n\n\n\nAND,\nthe coronal mass ejection from the 1859 Carrington Event arrived on\nEarth faster than our early warning system now.\n\n\n\nChina\nand Europe are equally vulnerable. China\u2019s actually installing\na high-power electrical grid that is more vulnerable than that of the\nU.S. and Europe, and the other developed nations will be similarly\nimpacted. What's important is that, as far as a reality check, the\nhead of the European Space Agency / Space Weather, says: This is a\nfair and balanced report. So, that's some of the possibilities.\n\n\n\n\nNow, these are the G-20 with the Queen. If we look at the Obama White\nHouse website and ask about 2012, 2013, the only thing that is on the\nwebsite as far as energy policy is that the U.S. wants to ensure that\nten percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012.\nSo that's a policy statement, and this is entirely off the\nradar.\n\n\n\nSo\nhere's a key question. Obviously, if we had smart leadership at the\nhelm of the planet, we would be getting off the grid and we'd be\nusing some of the non-polluting zero-point energy sources such as\nanti-gravity technology and important teleportation technology which\nwould revolutionize transport on this planet and which are available\nnow on an operational basis in the black budget economy.\n\n\n\nSo\nthe question is: Are we being set up to fail and suffer an effective\nsystems collapse if the 2012 to 2013 solar flares materialize?\n\n\n\nNow, here are some other impacts \u2013 the effect of Solar Cycle 24\non human behavior and that is that sunspots give off solar flares\nthat increase negative ionization on Earth, and increased negative\nionization during sunspot maximum periods increases human\nexcitability and activity. So, some of the regularities in studying\npast solar cycles is that there\u2019s a definite tendency for\npandemics to occur during solar maxima.\n\n\nNow,\nthe current H1N1 virus may be being manipulated, and it's\nbeing manipulated at a time in which, if we go back centuries, we\nknow that there's a tendency for pandemics to occur. And this is\ndating back to the early 1700's.\n\n\n\nSo,\nif there is an attempt in the H1N1 virus and the mandatory\nvaccination scheme, then it's truly diabolical because people are\nworking with historical data that shows that there is a tendency for\npandemics to occur.\n\n\n\nSome\nof the research shows that geomagnetic storms cause different\nreactions, primarily in males. Women seem to experience less change\nin accordance with the Sun's behavior. Men may become increasingly\nirritable and aggressive \u2013 either that or they become more\ncreative.  to\nbe made there.\n\n\n\nBut\nthis brings us to the Index of Human Excitability, which was\ndeveloped by a Soviet professor. He traced the incidence of wars,\nrevolutions-rise, expeditions, and migrations from 500 BC to 1922 AD.\n\n\nWhat\nhe shows is that... He divided them into four periods and showed that\nin period Two and Three \u2013 which correspond to 2010 to 2011,\nwhich is coming up in this next year; and 2012 to 2014 \u2013 there\nis, to take the maximum... In 2012 to 2014 it's the maximum\nexcitability: the election of liberals or radicals, mass\ndemonstrations, riots, revolutions, war, and the resolution of most\npressing demands. So that's what has occurred historically during the\nsolar maxima.\n\n\nNow,\nthere is (and we do not have time to get into it today) but we do have\nanother PowerPoint which shows the effect of a spaced-based weapon of\nmass destruction known as HAARP, which you may have heard of, and its\ndemonstrated mood and mind control ability. So, we do not know.\n\n\n\nHAARP\nis another variable which may be off-setting the effects of the Index\nof Human Mass Excitability and the effects during the solar\nmaximum of sunspots, in that HAARP can render entire populations\nextremely apathetic and confused. There's deep evidence that that is\noccurring. We may have intersecting variables here. One reason why\nour body politic is so apathetic  sources from systematic mind\ncontrol through technologies such as HAARP.\n\n\n\nBut\nit's also related to the sunspot cycles in that we are in a deep solar\nminimum now. I mean, there's all these outrages happening and the\nhuman population seems relatively apathetic, to begin to move around\nit.\n\n\n\nBut\nthis data is very hopeful because if we have a rapid swing in\nsunspots over the next few years, it will be, hopefully, not the time\nfor wars, but the time for social breakthroughs.\n\n\n\nThis\nbrings us to several possible visions that we can have of Solar Cycle\n24, 2009 to 2020.\n\n\nThe\nDisintegration Vision is global and regional wars \u2013 the\nArmageddon meme. This is the meme employed by the\nPermanent War Economy, whose business it is to promote war as an\nindustrial activity and to keep us organized around war within the\ndialectic of \u201cenemies\u201d; to have all of our productive\ncapacity, and our mental capacity, and our emotional capacity (our\nfears) directed towards war... which is an industrial activity, like\nmaking shoes.\n\n\nI\nshould say that back in the mid-\u201970's when I was a futurist at\nStanford Research Institute, that was being actively studied there \u2013\nthat is, the break-up of the U.S. into about five or six\nregion-nations. And so, in my mind, there's a question as to whether\nthat's an attempted social engineering to deconstruct what is one of\nthe advanced democracies that could be a positive force.\n\n\n\nIs\nthis the outcome of Solar Cycle 24?\n\n\nWell,\nthere's an alternative vision. It's kind of Is the glass\nhalf-empty or the glass half-full? Or rose-colored Glasses\n\u2013 and that is peaceful conflict-resolution.\n\n\n\nRight\nnow, money is actually the private property of a very small group of\npeople. The U.S. dollar until now has been the reserve currency for\nthe world, but the dollar bills that you have in your pocket are\nactually the property of the Federal Reserve Bank \u2013 you only\nhave a temporary license to use them.\n\n\n\nThe\nFederal Reserve Bank, according to a 1976 U.S. Senate sub-committee\nstudy (which we have online; just google 911 War Crimes\nTribunal)... the Federal Reserve Bank is actually beneficially\nowned by one family and that's the Rothschild family which is\nheadquartered in London and France.\n\n\n\nThis\nis a very grounded study which was done of the ownership of the banks\nthat in turn own the Federal Reserve System. So we have one family\nthat owns all of the currency in the world, and the currency itself\nis private property of that family.\n\n\n\nWell,\nin fact, money should be a public utility like electricity or\nlike water. With public central banks, then, if you wanted to start a\nbusiness, well the bank would just provide money to you in the same\nway that it provides electricity to your workshop, and water, and\npublic transportation. So it's a whole transformation that can happen\nwith regard to money.\n\n\n\nwe have\nbuilt these concrete roads which take away all the green space,\ncities are designed around the automobile, and we are using explosions\nand polluting fossil fuel to move these heavy hunks of steel to\ntransfer maybe one or two persons.\n\n\n\nWell,\nteleportation\nis an actual mechanism now. If you go to www.examiner.com\n, I have got a column there \u2013 just enter my name, Alfred Webre,\nin the search \u2013 and this past week we released an article which\nis now the number one political Examiner article in the USA. It's at\nthe top. It's being read more than any political Examiner article in\nthe U.S., and that is that two whistleblowers have now come forth and\nconfirmed that they have teleported from Earth to Mars and met with\nMartian extraterrestrials.\n\n\n\nBoth\nof those whistleblowers are affiliated with Project Camelot \u2013\nArthur Neumann, who's been using a name to protect himself up until\nnow (Henry Deacon) and Andrew\nBasiago, who's a colleague of mine in the Mars Anomaly Research\nSociety.\n\n\n\nSo,\nwe now have definite proof and whistleblowers \u2013 a very high\nlevel of evidence \u2013 that teleportation is being employed in the\nNational Security State, and that could revolutionize our\nentire society and will revolutionize our society.\n\n\n\nI\nthink I can share this because Andrew, my colleague, has now shared\nit... he was enrolled as a child participant in a DARPA time travel\nprogram by the U.S. which, the U.S. we know definitively now, has had\nthe ability to time travel either by Chronovisor -- kind of a\ntelevision or a three-dimensional hologram that looks at forward and\npast scenes; and via actual teleportation devices.\n\n\n\nAndrew\nhas been to the year 2045 and it's a beautiful Earth. There's a lot\nof greenery and the cities are all kind of ecological and they are\nconcentrated.\n\n\n\nSo\nwe have a peaceful future, say about 30 or 40 years from now, and\nit's just this transition that we are going through.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthere have been people who have been to the future on a physical\nbasis for the United States government, bringing back information\nfrom the future to the past to help humanity plan for the future. And\nit's quite positive.\n\n\n\nSo\nit's important to stay focused on the fact that we are going toward a\npositive future because that way we create it.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwhat we will be seeing also is that our very DNA, as we speak, is being\ntransformed by cosmic forces, by the Galactic Center black hole which\nis acting as sort of a gigantic laser beam  to transform our\nDNA to be able to handle a multi-dimensional future in which\nwe are once again interacting with the rest of organized society in\nthe universe, and to also bring us into an era of non-dualistic\nconsciousness.\n\n\n\nThese\nare some of the changes that will be occurring that we are living\nthrough now and will be occurring during Solar Cycle 24, on an\nintense basis, from 2009 to 2020.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthese can be the outcomes of Solar Cycle 24 \u2013 a Transformation\nVision rather than a Disintegration Vision, and it depends\none where one wants to put one's energy and what sort of holistic\nvision one wants to maintain.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we should also talk about the fact that we are going through the\nplane of the Galactic Center black hole. If we look at our Milky Way\nGalaxy, it looks kind of like a pancake with a Galactic Center black\nhole at the center. It's about 100,000 light-years across; there are\nabout 200- to 400-billion star systems in it.\n\n\n\nAt\nthe center of the Galaxy is a massive black hole, about four-million\ntimes the density of our Sun, and that black hole spins around once\nevery eleven minutes, as opposed to our Earth which spins around once\nevery 24 hours, and our sun which revolves about once a month.\n\n\n\nSo\nthe Galactic Center black hole... and now science has confirmed that\nevery galaxy, most galaxies, have a black hole at their center. It\u2019s\nlike the engine of the Galaxy which at the physical level is creating\nthe stars and various other celestial matter and at other dimensional\nlevels is creating life and consciousness.\n\n\n\nDNA\nis being affected by the Galactic Center black hole, and our very\nconsciousness. We tend to think that, again, our thoughts are our\nown; there are our thoughts. Our individual little radio-receptor\nbrains and minds are picking up a vast field, a morphogenic\nfield, that is being broadcast by the Galactic Center black\nhole, indeed by the universal axis, at once, to ALL.\n\n\n\n\nThis is another view of the Milky Way Galaxy. You can see how it's a\npancake with a Galactic Center black hole at the center.\n\n\n\nNow,\n this is the Galactic Center black hole. The plane\nof our Solar System is now passing through the plane of the Galactic\nCenter black hole. It's a 36-year journey. It started in 1980 and\nwill go to 2016. So we are going through the plane of the Galactic\nCenter black hole right now.\n\n\n\nThis\nGalactic alignment occurs about once every 12,800 years. \nThat's another schematic which shows how the plane is going through.\nIt takes about 36 years.\n\n\n\nThere\nmay be Earth changes during this time. Some of the theories of the\nEarth changes are interesting. One is a Galactic Superwave\ntheory, and that is looking at the Galaxy as an enormous volcano with\nthe Galactic Center sort of the center, and Galactic bursts\noccur which are sent out in a Superwave fashion, taking debris and\nmaterial throughout the Galaxy.\n\n\n\nAnother\nsource of possible Earth changes would be celestial bodies entering\nthe Solar System like what occurred in 9500 BC, which is when a\nportion \u2013 fragments \u2013 of this Vela supernova entered the\nSolar System and apparently collided with Mars, which was then an\nactive, verdant planet with a common human society with our Earth,\nand destroyed the ecology of Mars, so that now it\u2019s a very\nfragile ecology. The survivors are an intelligent human civilization\nliving under the surface of Mars.\n\n\n\nThis\nhit Earth also and destroyed our great maritime civilization which\nPlato called Atlantis, which was the \u201clast world.\u201d So, we\nhumans have gone through a very severe trauma in the last 11,500\nyears, with the 9500 BC Solar System catastrophe.\n\n\n\nWhat\nwriter Barbara Hand Clow says is that one of the reasons why we have\nsuch genetic and embedded fear of impending catastrophe is we have\ncatastrophobia and it's the memory of the 9500 BC Solar System\ncatastrophe. That is, our future is going to be relatively stable -\nit's our collective psyche which is unstable.\n\n\n\nThe\nGalactic Center black hole may have energy bursts which may change,\nflip, or wobble the Earth. These are the possible sources, but again\nwe have to look at this within the lens of catastrophobia.\n\n\nOne\nresearcher has codified a Time Acceleration Matrix for the\nGalactic alignment and that is the concept that time is really\naccelerating. we are in the space-time dimension and the dimension of\ntime is accelerating: Oh My God, it's Saturday again!\n You know: How did that happen?\n\n\nWhat\nhe says is that we are coming into a period of human enlightenment,\nthe disappearance of national borders, Divinely-guided anarchy, and\nthe strengthening of the East. So, you know, this is part of the\nthing that\u2019s occurring.\n\n\nwe are\nalso going through a photon band which may be a force to\nincrease our consciousness and, as we just mentioned, the rate of\nchange is accelerating \u2013 and that is that there will be 20\ntimes as much change and transformation in the period February to\nDecember 2011 as there was during the period 1999 to January 2011.\nSo, 20 times as much change in that single year as between 1999, when\nthe Internet really started in full swing, to 2011. So we are in this\nTime Acceleration Matrix. \n\n\nExopolitics\nis a science, and as a science of relations between our human\ncivilization and other intelligent civilizations in the universe,\nprovides a framework of interface by which our civilization, on a\nsocietal basis, can begin to interface with other extraterrestrial\nand interdimensional civilizations.\n\n\n\nOne\ncan say when positing the future that the degree of conscious\ninteraction and cooperation amongst human society and advanced\nethical extraterrestrial civilizations will be a determining factor\nin a positive human future.\n\n\n\nRight\nnow, there appears by the evidence to be a long-standing strategic\nrelationship between the Martian civilization and the human\ncivilization \u2013 at least in terms of U.S. bases on Mars, and\nMartians openly working in Hughes Aircraft, as we have witnesses of\nthat.\n\n\n\nMy\ncolleague, Andrew Basiago, in 1971, in the company of his father, who\nwas a CIA contractor, met three Martian astronauts at Curtis-Wright\nField in New Jersey, who were visiting on a liaison mission.\n\n\nSo,\nour task now is to make all of that which is occurring in the covert\nworld \u2013 in the subconscious, as it were \u2013 to bring it\ninto public light. That's part of the survival mechanism, and\nExopolitics is the conceptual structure that makes that possible.\nIn\nfact, we can say that Exopolitics may function as the new survival\nscience for humanity.\n\n\nHere\n we have, for example, a crop circle pattern that seems to be\nthe same spiral pattern as our Milky Way Galaxy, suggesting that many\nof these concepts are being played for us in a multi-dimensional way.\n\n\n\nThis is the Time Acceleration Matrix for galactic alignment.\nDr. Carl Johan Calleman and Barbara Hand Clow have developed this,\nand it begins to show by going through various eras of human history\nhow time accelerates. For each of these periods, there is 20 times as\nmuch change in the next period.\n\n\n\nFor\nexample, in the National Period from 3115 BC to 1755 AD\u2026\nwell, in the next period starting just before the French Revolution,\nthe American Revolution, etcetera, up to the beginning of the\nInternet\u2026 well, in the Planetary Period there's 20\ntimes as much change as there was during the National.\n\n\nAnd\nwhen we go to the Galactic Period, from January 1999 to\nFebruary 2011, that's when all these thoughts of the Galaxy start\ncoming. Humanity goes Galactic. We have all this interest in\nBattlestar Galactica; everyone becomes interested in\nextraterrestrial issues, on a planetary basis.\n\n\n\nWell,\nthat's all coming from the Galactic Center black hole and from the\nemanations at the universal level. There's 20 times as much change\nthere as there was during the Planetary Period in terms of\nbringing us up to a frequency and knowledge and information and\ncognitive basis to be able to participate as citizens of a\nmulti-dimensional, highly-organized, and populated universe.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthat's just a prelude to the Universal Era, which starts at\nthe beginning of 2011 in terms of the broadcast. Now, some people may\nbe right on the broadcast. You know, we each interpret it according\nto our individual transducers which are in our brains and in our\nminds and in our extended bodies.\n\n\nIf\nwe look at what the Mayan calendar is, then, it's really a mind-map.\nIt's not a calendar where you want to keep time; it's a mind-map\nbecause it maps what sorts of things humanity is going to have on its\nmind at any particular time.\n\n\n\nAnd\n2011 and 2012 is just the start of the Universal era on Earth.\nThose are the signals that are being broadcast from the Galactic\nCenter black hole, which the Mayans called Hunab-Ku.\n\n\nNow,\nif we just look, for example, at the Galactic Period, which\nstarted in 1999, that's when the center of the Galaxy started\nbroadcasting the whole, the Galactic... Well, if you look at\nthe year 1999, that's when the first book Exopolitics was\nwritten , because that\u2019s what\u2019s\nhappening.  Those were the signals being broadcast by the\nGalaxy. So all of this is kind of coming out in a \"matrix\"\nway.\n\n\n\nI\nhave just a few copies of this that I managed to smuggle through U.S.\nCustoms down to here for those who'd like to buy it... not smuggle.\nYou cannot bring books through on the aircraft, but I said that they\nwere pamphlets.  So, there you go.\n\n\n[slide\nof chart titled Time Acceleration Matrix] Then we had the\nfirst scholarly conference on Exopolitics in the year 2000 and we had\nother scholars come in.\n\n\n\nBy\nthe year 2003, that's when the first nation-state, Mexico, began to\ndisclose its UFO/extraterrestrial files in earnest.\n\n\n\nIn\n2004 and 2005, that\u2019s when Brazil, Peru, and Chile began to\ndisclose. The former deputy prime minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer,\ngave a speech then in which he said: Oh, UFO's are as real as the\nairplanes over your head and the U.S. government is planning to try\nto start an intergalactic war, so we have to do something about it.\n\n\nIn\nthe beginning of 2006, the Associated Press reported that Exopolitics\nhad been nominated for Word of the Year for 2005. So, we begin to get\ninto the culture... these memes begin to get into the culture\n\u2013 these survival memes.\n\n\nIn\n2007, we had the Chicago/O\u2019Hare sighting. France and the United\nKingdom disclosed their UFO files.\n\n\n\nWe\nhad the former Governor of Arizona say that: Yes, the spacecraft\nwhich was a mile on a side which flew over Phoenix, Arizona, on March\n13, 1997 was an extraterrestrial spacecraft and I am sorry I did what\nI did and try to cover it up!  That happened in 2006.\n\n\n\nIn\nthe beginning of 2007... we could go into the Chicago/O\u2019Hare\nsighting. This is very interesting. Just to make it brief: a 60-foot\nUFO came down at United Gate C-17 at Chicago/O\u2019Hare Airport\n(I have been to that gate) about 4:00 in the afternoon. It was\nwitnessed by the plane, the ground crew, the tower; the FAA got\ninvolved, and it was all over the major media. It came down there on\nNovember 7, 2006.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s\na theory which we wrote about, about 20 years ago, called the Context\nCommunication Theory of Extraterrestrial Communications, which is\nthat all UFOs are like dreams \u2013 they are communication\nfrom a higher intelligent source. they are like dreams of\ncommunications from your subconscious to your conscious.\n\n\n\nWell,\nNovember 7, 2006... what day was that? That was the U.S. mid-term\nelection in which the Neocons lost control of both houses of\nCongress. And I was a civil liberties lawyer, you know, working in\nthat field also, and, you know, a police state was about to take over\nin the U.S.\n\n\n\nIn\nfact, that sighting on mid-term election day was when the shift\nhappened in both houses of Congress, and with the election then in\n2008 which also brought about the collapse of the old financial\nstructure during what\u2019s called The Fifth Night of the\nGalactic Underworld.\n\n\nIn\nother words, all of these \u2013 the collapse of the economic\nstructure \u2013 is because things that are hierarchal and are based\non control and are not sustainable are being all collapsed now\nbecause that\u2019s the programming coming out from the Galactic\nCenter black hole. So it\u2019s all happening according to a large\nschedule.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwe are apparently in the Sixth Day, from November \u201908\nto November \u201909, of the Galactic Underworld.\n\n\nWhat\nhappened on December 12, 2008? That\u2019s when the discovery of\nlife on Mars happened in the NASA photographs of the NASA rover,\nSpirit,\nwhich is on the surface of Mars. It photographed humanoids, animals,\nstructures on Mars. And you can go to www.exopolitics.com\nand see scientific papers \u2013 there are over 40 documents.\nthey are all free to download.\n\n\n\nSo\nall of this is what\u2019s happening according to the drivers behind\nthe universe at the galactic level and at the universe level. So,\nit\u2019s ALL GOOD! \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nso, we can look forward to more Disclosure. We can look forward to\nmore positive things occurring as the old structures collapse. The\nthing is not to identify and suffer for the old structures.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwhat are some of the positive outcomes?\n\n\n\nWell,\nSpottiswoode \u2026 and here I want to\nacknowledge the research and insights of David Wilcock, who has\nprovided a lot of the energy and insights for looking at how these\nprocesses are resulting in a positive future.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, Spottiswoode, a psychologist / researcher from Palo\nAlto, California\u2026 each day at that time of the day when we are\nmost aligned with Galactic Center \u2013 and you can see the spike\non the graph there \u2013 our psychic ability increases 400 percent.\nSo, the more we are aligned with the Galactic Center black hole,\nand the Galactic Center, and the universe axis, the more psychic we\nare, the more we are in change.\n\n\n\nI have\ndone meditation exercises where I meditate on the Galactic Center. I\nmean, you know,  that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from.\n As David Wilcock has said: The energy of the Galaxy is\ndirectly tied in with the evolution of the human species by raising\nits level of consciousness. This is coming as with the certainty as\nthe streams flow. \n\n\nNow,\none of the mechanisms is DNA activation, and Peter Gariaev \u2013\nscientist Dr. Peter Gariaev \u2013 was able to transform a frog\nembryo into a salamander by shining a laser through the salamander\nembryo and re-directing it into the frog embryo, and the frog DNA\ntransformed into a salamander.\n\n\n\nAt\nthe Galactic level, that's what\u2019s occurring now. The Galactic\nCenter black hole is the analog to the laser, and we are being\ntransformed at the DNA level, so the more that we open ourselves up\nto that, the easier nature can take its course.\n\n\nThe\nGalactic Centers contain the pattern to transform all DNA on the\nplanet and they provide a sufficiently large source of energy to\nenable the transformation to take place.\nThat's\nDavid Wilcock expressing that realization.\n\n\n\n\nIt's even occurring at the Galactic level, and if we look at that,\nthat looks like a two-strand DNA. Correct?\n\n\n\nWell,\nif you look at that, it's the DNA Nebula, which is 80\nlight-years long and 300 light-years from the Galactic Center black\nhole. This is the first time that the DNA double helix, commonly seen\ninside living organisms, has been observed in the cosmos. In other\nwords, our Galaxy is a living organism.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthese changes are happening at the Galactic level, and we can take\nwhat's called the transposition burst as a plausible mechanism\nby which the Galactic Burst can activate our DNA, which\nis proved in the Gariaev experiment with the laser. So now we have a\nmodel for this.\n\n\n\nKelleher\ncalls the outcome of this product a light-body, which is\nwhat's been described as the dimensional existence of the\nupper-dimensional ethical extraterrestrials. we are in more and more\nrefined energy bodies.\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is the boundary? 2011, 2013, 2012? These are boundaries in\nwhich these mechanisms of transposition bursts from the\nGalactic Center are happening. And they are happening now.\n\n\n\nDr.\nJohn Jay Harper talks about that 97 percent of our DNA is now\nconsidered junk DNA and it's that DNA which is being\nactivated. So, we are receiving an upgrade from the inside \u2013\nHumans Version 2.0! \n\n\nEndogenous\nDMT produced in our brains could also bring about what some people\ncall a collective near-death experience that may occur...\nthese are some of the factors that may occur. we will have a collective\nnear-death experience and really go up into our light-bodies, our\nextended bodies, as a species... That will be an interesting\none!\n\n\nSo,\nendogenous DMT can be posited as a purveyor of the transformed\nconsciousness.\n\n\nKC:\n I am very sorry, we are at a little past 12:30. There's not any more\ntime to go any further into this.\n\n\n\nAW:\n Okay.\n\n\nKC:\n What we can do is, Alfred, you will make your presentation perhaps\navailable to people so that they can follow up on the final pages?\n\n\n\nAW:\n Yeah. Sure.\n\n\nKC:\n I am not sure how far along we are.\n\n\nAW:\n we are almost at the end. This is slide 53 of about 60 slides, so the\nbulk of the information has been transmitted \u2013 and of the\ninsight. \n\n\nKC:\n Okay. We would be glad to give Alfred a couple of minutes to\nactually sum up the presentation, if you'd like to do so.\n\n\nAW:\n Sure. Well, that we are coming into and we are in an\nera of tremendous opportunity which is occurring, regardless of our\nindividual thoughts.\n\n\n\nSo\nit makes good sense, if one is in resistance, to change one\u2019s\nthoughts and to really tune into what's occurring at the Galactic and\nuniversal levels, which is part of a universe program to allow us to\ncome into the Universal Age which we KNOW, by people who have\ngone to the future, physically, and come back... is going to be on\nour planet by the year 2045 or 2050, which is just 40 years away. So\nit's a positive future that's coming.\n\n\nI'll\nbe here... I'll be in the back... I have brought some copies of the\nbook Exopolitics\nwhich founded this whole field, and if you want more information,\nplease stay tuned to www.exopolitics.com.\n\n\nThank\nyou! \n\n\nKC:\n There are some fascinating areas that could be investigated further\nthat he\u2019s been touching on and some of that information is\navailable from our whistleblowers on Project Camelot.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave another recent interview that talks about the Galactic\nSuperwave. Paul LaViolette is the scientist responsible for that\nconcept and he\u2019s done a lot of investigation. We visited him in\nGreece and did a recent interview. we have yet to edit it; we have\nbeen so busy, but I just wanted to let you know that that is in the\narea, some of which Alfred was referring to.\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKERRY\nCASSIDY (KC):  Okay, Rich Dolan! How\u2019s it looking?\n\n\nRICHARD\nDOLAN (RD):  I think we are ready.\n\n\nBILL\nRYAN (BR):  you are ready to go?\n\n\nKC:\n Okay. we are going to tell everything we know about Rich Dolan,\nbecause we kind of know him well. .\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s\nsuch a political guy that he has his hand on the political pulse, and\nhe\u2019s got a brand-new book out. Bill has actually read it. I\nhave not had time lately. I read his other book, though, and I\ncan tell you, he\u2019s a wonderful writer. UFOs\nand the National Security State\n\u2013 we have been waiting forever\nfor the second volume and finally it\u2019s out and apparently it\u2019s\nabsolutely phenomenal.\n\n\n\nRich\nis just an amazing guy. let us see, do we say Rhodes Scholar\nfinalist? Whatever. And historian; brilliant, brilliant mind; very\nlevel-headed; politically-astute. He\u2019s also himself an\nintuitive. He does not tell you that, but he is! And I have\nknown him from before Camelot, so I have to say that I actually tried\nto spur him on to more radicalism. \n\n\n\nI\nknow we have to move things along, Bill. Okay, Bill, why do not\nyou do the official introduction? I think I have pushed around\nenough dirt here.\n\n\nBR:\n That was the unofficial one? Okay. The official introduction is very\nbrief. Twenty years ago I read Timothy Good\u2019s Above\nTop Secret, which was\nknown by many in those days as the\nBible of UFOlogy. That\u2019s\nthe book which you give people who doubt the reality of the\nphenomenon and then you say: Okay,\nread that and we will talk again.\n\n\nNow\nthere\u2019s a new book that supersedes this in every way. And, as\nKerry was saying, it\u2019s not just one book, it\u2019s a trilogy,\nand Rich has just published the second of three volumes, 638 pages.\nIt\u2019s the second volume which takes it from... is it \u201978\nto...?\n\n\n\nRD:\n \u201973 to \u201991.\n\n\nBR:\n \u201973 to...?\n\n\nRD:\n \u201991.\n\n\nBR:\n \u201973 to \u201991 \u2013 some very interesting years in\nUFOlogy. And Volume 3 is from \u201991 to the present.\n\n\n\nRich\nhas got no other role here than being an academic historian, with all\nthe combination of intellectual rigor and thinking outside the box.\nHe\u2019s surfing on the waves of history itself here, chronicling\nthese times which are unique in the history of the human race, we\nbelieve. I believe that Richard believes this too, and he knows\nprobably more about this subject now than almost anybody else on the\noutside of the inside.\n\n\n\nKC:\n On the outside of the National Security State.\n\n\n\nBR:\n I am not going to say anymore. Richard, take it away and tell them\neverything you know. you have got one hour.\n\n\n\nKC:\n Okay.\n\n\n\nRD:\n Thanks very much. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here. I\u2019d like\nto thank Bill and Kerry for that very gracious introduction and other\npeople here at Camelot, who have made my trip here a lot easier\nand more pleasant. I thank them, also.\n\n\n\nI have\nalready enjoyed meeting a number of attendees here. As I have\noften felt that \u2013 I absolutely mean this \u2013 I learn more\nat the conferences, I think, than you do from me. The reason is that\nthere is never a lack of brilliant people who know an awful lot about\nthis, and they typically will come up to me; some of them will come\nup to me during the conference, and proceed to tell me these\nincredible things. So, it\u2019s always worthwhile for me to come\nhere, and I also just enjoy meeting people.\n\n\n\n\nI do have a new book out. It\u2019s\nthe second volume of UFOs\nand the National Security State.\nI do have some copies here. I hope I brought enough, but the book is\neasily available now at my website [ www.keyholepublishing.com\n] and on www.amazon.com,\nand I will be talking a little bit about that.\n\n\n\nFor\nmy quarry today I have titled my lecture Exopolitics\nin a New Key: Creating a Fresh Roadmap.\nI do not know if that\u2019s a bit ostentatious or not. I wrote\nit on the plane on the way out here, so, literally, it\u2019s a\nbrand new lecture.\n\n\n\nSo\nlet us begin. I have got three basic themes that I want to\ncover today. First, I do want to talk a little bit about my book, not\nto market it, but, really, because it\u2019s relevant toward the\nlater theme that I want to discuss today.\n\n\nI have\ndeveloped some thoughts over the last several years about\nExopolitics. I have never written explicitly about Exopolitics,\nbut, for various reasons, I am often asked to comment on Exopolitics.\n\n\n\n\nI\nhave, for example, spoken at every one of the Steven Bassett\u2019s\nX-Conferences.\nIn fact, I think I am the only person who\u2019s spoken at all\nof them, and I have attended and spoken at all of the National\nPress Club events that he\u2019s had. So, that\u2019s something of\nan Exopolitical event and that\u2019s put me within that whole\ndiscussion.\n\n\nSo,\nI have some thoughts about Exopolitics, which I think are my own and\nI\u2019d like to share those with you today. And I\u2019d like to\nwrap it up, continuing along those lines, with my own thoughts on\nwhere we are headed as a society, as a civilization -- indeed, as a\nspecies. I think it all works together rather well. So, we are a\nlittle bit behind schedule and I\u2019ll move right ahead.\n\n\nMy\nnew book is subtitled The\nCover-up Exposed. It took\nme about five years to write this book. Actually it\u2019s\nimpossible for me to know because my first volume went through two\neditions. The second edition came out in 2002 and people \u2013 back\nthen I was brand new in the field at the time \u2013 and people\nsaid: Oh, that\u2019s a\npretty good book. What about the rest of the story?\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nI thought: Yeah, I have to\ndo that, do not I?\nBut then I wrote a lot of articles and I did various public speaking\nvenues, and so forth, and I estimate about five solid years of\nworking on this particular volume.\n\n\nIt\ntook a lot out of me in a lot of ways, to be perfectly candid with\nyou. It was a hard book to do, harder than the first volume I wrote.\nI was lucky because, after that first book came out, a lot of people\ncame out of the woodwork and offered me their resources.\n\n\n\nI\nhad one very, very dear friend of mine, an elderly gentleman who,\nwhen he passed away, left me his entire immense library of nearly \u2013\nthe shy side of 1,000 books, not to count numerous journals. An\nenormous, enormous library collection which I actually read; I went\nthrough all the journals.\n\n\n\nYou\nhave to understand. When I read these things, I am very\nmethodical, if you know me. So, when I read a book, I do not\njust read it and say: Oh\nthat\u2019s a good book.\nI have my notes and usually my word processor and I take notes all\nthe way through. Every little datum that I think is interesting goes\nin the notes with the citation: page\n77 of this issue of this journal,\nwhatever. And it goes in, so that I put them all together into an\nenormous database.\n\n\n\nMy\nUFO database is equal to, I think, about a 3,000 or 4,000-page book\nand it\u2019s from that that actually I put all my narrative\ntogether. So it comes from literally hundreds and hundreds of\ndifferent sources dealing with UFOlogy, but also dealing with\npolitics and geopolitics and para-politics and whatever else you want\nto call it, and all other sundry weird things that strike my fancy,\nand it all goes into my database.\n\n\nSo\nthen, when I come to year, say, 1977, I\u2019ll look at everything\nfrom that year and it all comes together in a way that I would not\nprobably have otherwise thought to do. That\u2019s how I write my\nbooks. It\u2019s not what they teach you in graduate school, but\nthat is what I do.\n\n\nThis\nis a pretty big, fat book. It\u2019s a little over 600 pages. I have\ngot lots and lots of end notes and index entries. In fact, the other\nway to look at this is a series of a little over 200 specific\narticle-length sections that I have tried to weave together. Each\nsubsection of this book, I think, can just be taken independently and\nread as its own unit. So, if you had a particular interest in one\nlittle thing, you could open the book and read that, but they all do\nwork together.\n\n\nIf\nyou are interested in more information about this, you can go to my\nwebsite which is www.keyholepublishing.com\n\u2013 just like looking through a key hole, an image I have\nalways enjoyed regarding this topic.\n\n\n\nWhat\nI tried to do in writing all books and all articles that I have\ndone, and all public appearances that I have ever done, is to try\nto provide a reliable guide to our past -- our recent past, in\nparticular.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nlong been my feeling that our past is somewhat unknown to us, and if\nwe are going to proceed as a responsible society, we have to\nknow our past.\n\n\n\nMuch\nof our past exists in the form of official government documents and\narchives. You may not know this, but in fact it is now widely\nunderstood that the vast majority of U.S. government documents ever\ncreated remain completely inaccessible to you and to me. They are\nclassified. In other words, a large \u2013 not a little, but a large\n\u2013 majority of our own history is off limits to us. This is not\njust UFOs. This is everything.\n\n\n\nWe\nare in a very, very difficult and dangerous state when the large\nmajority of our written documentary history is not available for us\nto study. There is a very serious problem with that. So, what I have\ntried to do with the UFO topic is my part in salvaging our history.\nLiterally, that\u2019s how I look at it. I do not know how\ncomplete it is, but it\u2019s as complete as I am able to make\nit.\n\n\n\nToward\nthat end, I have used the largest amount that I am able to\nof government documents, that is, proven documents that you cannot\nmake an argument against: journals, reliable journals or at least in\nmy opinion good journals, and that includes journals by UFO\ninvestigative organizations doing on-the-spot investigations, a wide\nrange of such journals; various books, of course.\n\n\n\nAnd\nI have done a lot of interviews for this particular book. I\nactually do not know how many individuals I interviewed, maybe a\ncouple of dozen. Maybe 20 or 30 people directly involved in the\nevents that are in this book, I either met with in person, or did\nextended telephone interviews, or conducted correspondence with, and\ngot their stories directly. And all of it, again, trying to weave\ntogether as reliable an account as I can.\n\n\n\nI\nwant to emphasize that everything in this book, with a couple of very\nspecific exceptions, is verifiable data. Now, there are some\nexceptions.\n\n\n\nAny\nresearcher, as I am sure you will understand, who\u2019s been\nin this field long enough, is going to have individuals that come up\nto them and say: I\nappreciate your work. I have this bit of information that I would\nlike to share with you. Here it is, but you have to promise that you\ncannot give up my identity. I have a sensitive position, etcetera,\netcetera. And that\nhappens; that\u2019s life. It\u2019s unfortunate that it has to be\nthat way, but there it is.\n\n\nNow,\nany time a researcher gets that information and then repeats it,\nkeeping the anonymity of the source, of course, it\u2019s a\ndifficult situation, because it puts you, the recipient of that\ninformation, in an unequal position. This is something that I never,\never believe in doing.\n\n\n\nMy\nattitude as a writer and as a communicator is that we speak as\nequals, so that anything that I know, you should be able to know as\nwell. That\u2019s how it should be. That\u2019s how good history,\nthat\u2019s how good science is done, so I try to go easy with that.\n\n\n\n\nI am\nsometimes distressed by some researchers in this field, and I am\nnot really going to name names. I am not interested in doing\nthat today, but there are people who really do this to excess, in my\nopinion.\n\n\n\nMaybe\nthey feel they have no choice; they feel that they have to get the\nword out. But the problem is that when you do this, you are not\nnecessarily helping the public discourse on this. What you are\ndoing instead is creating a lot of uncertainty about it.\n\n\n\nSo,\nwe are in a difficult position. We have what we feel are certain\ntruths and realities that we want to communicate to the rest of the\nworld, which we feel is in the dark and asleep. I think that\u2019s\ntrue.\n\n\n\nBut\nwe have to be aware of who we are speaking to when we engage in this\nkind of conversation. We have to be as responsible about this as\nwe are able to be and not unduly place the public\u2019s trust\nin what we have to say, but rather, as I have been saying, the\npublic should be able, any time, to check and verify the things that\nwe say.\n\n\nOkay,\nenough said on that.\n\n\nThis\nbook really is, as I see it, three major themes that I tried to weave\ntogether. The first theme is what we might call the encounters,\nsomething of an encyclopedic account of this particular 18-year\nperiod of UFO history.\n\n\n\nSo,\nif you had an interest in the Travis Walton event, you could read\nabout it in my book and my hope would be that you would read the\nbest, most concise, most complete  great account of it in\nroughly \u2013 I think about 10 pages I spent on Travis Walton \u2013\nthat you would find anywhere; or on the Hudson Valley waves of UFO\nsightings of The Eighties, ditto; or the\nHessdalen case in Norway; or the Bob Lazar\nphenomenon in the late \u201880s, or anything else that happened in\nthat period of time.\n\n\n\nMy\ngoal was that you could use this book as a reference and a reliable\nguide and know what you needed to know, learn what you needed to\nlearn. So, that was the first, and that\u2019s a lot of the book.\n\n\nThe\nsecond major theme, though, I guess would be the politics. Obviously\nthere\u2019s politics to this. So, what I tried to do, again, is\nlearn and analyze the primary military and intelligence community\ndocuments that describe this -- not just those of the United States,\nincidentally, but trying to gain the attitude of responsible agencies\nfrom any and all nations that encountered this.\n\n\n\nThe\nSoviet Union figures heavily in this book, as does to some extent\neven China; the European nations most definitely, and other countries\nas well: Australia, Africa  Middle East. they are all in\nhere.\n\n\n\nAnd\nto the extent possible I have tried to weave their take on this\nand their attitude in here -- attitudes of various Presidents, of all\nthe Presidents; Presidential policy that\u2019s relevant to the UFO\nphenomenon. The man in the center, of course, is David Rockefeller.\n He\u2019s in the book. I\u2019ll\nget into that a little more in just a few minutes.\n\n\n\nThe\nthird major theme or strand of this book would be the research. In a\nsense this book is a history of UFOlogy, which is a fascinating\nstory. In fact, of all the things that I researched in doing this\nbook, there were times when I felt that this to me, was personally\nthe most interesting.\n\n\n\nBack\nin the old days when I was in my late teens and early 20s, I was\nstudying history and English literature. That was my dual major. My\nfocus in history back then was what is called intellectual\nhistory. It\u2019s kind\nof like the history of ideas.\n\n\n\nI have\nalways been interested in that, and really it occurred to me in\nwriting this volume that the story of UFOlogy is a part of\nintellectual history, without a doubt, and this is a story that I\nfeel, in reviewing the literature, really had not been done in a\nsynthesized, coherent way.\n\n\n\nI\nthink this book is actually a first true history of UFOlogy. we will\ncome to that again in a moment.\n\n\nThere\u2019s\na backdrop involved in this book and it\u2019s one of global\ntransformation. You have, for example, geopolitical transformation,\nthe breaking up of the Soviet Union by 1991 at the end of this\nvolume. You have the birth of personal computing and even the\nInternet before the end of this particular period. And you have\nthroughout \u2013 I tried to look at what we might call advanced,\neither open or covert, cutting-edge technologies. The image on the\ntop there\n is the\nfamous ARV \u2013 Alien Reproduction Vehicle.\n\n\n\nI\nthink I saw\nGordon Novel here in\nthe audience; Gordon, hello, if you are there.\n\n\nSo,\nin other words, there are things in the larger world at large that\naffected this story, and again, I tried to pay as close attention to\nthem as I could. So, I just wanted to expand a little bit on each of\nthose three themes and then move on to the next part of this talk.\n\n\nThe\nencounters: The thing that strikes me when I reviewed the cases\ninvolved, the UFO encounters that took place, is the quantity\nof well-documented, just astonishing, mind-blowing encounters that\ntook place --military cases galore; hundreds and hundreds of them.\n\n\n\nI\nwas fortunate in getting access to a database provided to me by the\nresearcher and former Aerojet\nemployee, Ron Regehr.\nRon worked on\u2026 he was involved in building what was called the\nDSP satellite. That\u2019s Defense Support Program satellites. A\nvery interesting kind of satellite in which Ron argued, I think with\na lot of persuasion, that they are designed perfectly to be\nUFO-spotting devices.\n\n\n\nIn\nany case, Ron was able \u2013 accidentally, but legally -- to obtain\na list of DSP tracks of Fast\nWalkers during this\nperiod of time; in other words, Fast\nWalker being the code\nword for UFO in the upper atmosphere in space.\n\n\n\nThere\nwere... I am trying to recall... from 1973 to 1991 about 283, I\nthink that\u2019s right, Fast\nWalker trackings by the\nDSP satellites during that period of time. It\u2019s like one every\nmonth or more, 15 a year, I believe. A couple of them were really\ninteresting, one in which an object came in from space and did a\nU-turn in the vicinity of one of the satellites.\n\n\n\nThere\nwas also a DSP tracking of a UFO during the spectacular 1976 Iranian\njet fighter intercept. Many people are familiar with this and I,\nagain, cover this at length in my book.\n\n\n\nTo\nmake a long story short, in September 1976, over the city of Teheran\n\u2013  and, of course, this is back in the days of the Shah when\nIran was an ally of the United States \u2013 a large number of\nTeheran citizens saw this very unusual object in the evening sky.\nThey called the local airport.\n\n\n\nThe\nair traffic controller person at first thought it was silly, then he\nwent out and looked  and saw exactly what people were\nreporting, and he called the Iranian Air Force. They sent two F-4\nfighter jet interceptors in succession, and we know all about this\nbecause \u2013 we know a lot about it because \u2013 we have a very\nextended defense intelligence agency memo describing this in\nfascinating detail.\n\n\n\nWhat\nhappened is that in each case of the F-4 encounters, when they got to\nwithin a range of 25 nautical miles of this object \u2013 which they\ntracked on airborne radar, which they saw visually, which astonished\nthe pilots, each of them \u2013 when they got to within 25 nautical\nmiles, their key electronic systems went offline. In one case, right\nbefore one pilot was about to fire a missile at this object. It\ndisabled the missile system.\n\n\n\nIt\nso happens that we have DSP tracking data of a Fast\nWalker in exactly that\nspot at that time -- pretty interesting confirmation, indeed.\n\n\nBack\nto the quantity of these encounters, and what we find is just an\nenormous amount of unexplained events going on that any responsible\nresearcher would have to inquire about. Forget the issue, initially,\nof aliens.\n\n\n\nThe\nbiggest frustration I have when I talk to skeptics about this is that\nthey jump ten steps ahead of the argument and they\u2019ll say\nsomething like: Well\nthat\u2019s impossible because it\u2019s impossible for aliens to\ncome here from another planet. do not you know anything about\nastrophysics, or space\ntravel, or the impossibility... \n\n\nWell,\nokay. I cannot argue that and I know as well as the next person\nthat we do not have a way, ourselves, of getting to the nearest\nstar; not officially.\n\n\n\nBut\nnevertheless, the real issue is in looking at these UFO reports and\nthen trying to make sense out of them. Sure, it\u2019s easy to just\nsay it\u2019s impossible, but the question is: What\ndo you do with the\nreports? What most people\ndo is they ignore them, of course. That\u2019s the easy thing.\n\n\n\nA\nnumber of other very interesting developments during these years...\nAbductions: I actually write quite a bit about that phenomenon, and\nagain, I am going to come back to that shortly.\n\n\n\nThe\nmutilation phenomenon: Is\nthat or is that not related to the UFO phenomenon?\nI think it is. Crop circles, ditto. I think that there\u2019s a\nrelationship there, and all of these I tried to deal with as well as\nI could.\n\n\nSo\nconcluding, provisionally, regarding the encounter thread of this\nbook, there\u2019s a lot of conclusions we can make. let us\nkeep it simple: There is\nan overwhelming evidence for UFO reality. \n\n\nTo\nme, if I were to have the opportunity to speak to somebody on NBC or\nsome major network, this is the message I think that I would\nemphasize \u2013 that let us take one step at a time here, and\nthe evidence is overwhelming. This was my first primary goal in\nputting this book together, was to lay that evidence out as\npersuasively as I could.\n\n\n\nThe\npolitics: I am going to expand a little bit on this. Let me just\njump, put all of these out there and we can talk about them. There\u2019re\na lot of themes in my book that deal with what we would call the\npolitics of UFOs. Each of the presidential administrations, I tried\nto deal with, I did deal with.\n\n\n\n1973:\nWe had Richard Nixon still in the White House. There\u2019s some\npretty good Nixon UFO \u2013 there\u2019s one great\nNixon UFO story. That\u2019s the Nixon / Jackie Gleason story and\nthat\u2019s in my book.\n\n\n\nJimmy\nCarter and the whole... oh, skipping Gerald Ford through Carter,\nthrough the Reagan and Bush years -- it turns out that each of these\nPresidents has some fascinating connections to UFO history. So that\u2019s\none aspect of it.\n\n\n\nThen\nthe military/ intelligence-community-confirmed documents inform a lot\nof this book as well. One thing that is very clear from looking at\nthe mass of that data is not simply that the phenomenon is real, but\nthat they were very, very concerned about this phenomenon. \n\n\n\nIt\nmakes perfect sense when you are in charge of managing security\nover an Air Force base and an object that you cannot identify is\ncoming over your base, doing things that are not supposed to be\npossible.\n\n\n\nFor\nexample, in the wave of airspace violations in 1975 along the\nnorthern US border into Canada, over many bases with the Strategic\nAir Command, triggering maximum-level alerts, sirens going, lights\nflashing and all of that, with objects hovering 500 feet over weapons\nstorage facilities.\n\n\n\nYes,\nit happened and it happened multiple times during a brief period in\nlate 1975. And we know for sure that this excited the concern of\nresponsible agencies. We learned about this because we were at a very\nunique stage in American history in the late \u201870s, and that was\nwhen the Freedom of Information Act was actually kind of, sort of,\nuseful.\n\n\n\nBack\nin those days \u2013 this was the early Carter years \u2013 Jimmy\nCarter had a very liberal attitude about FOIA and did promote a\nrelative amount of openness in relation to these government\ndocuments.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s\nstill a great deal that was never released and, in fact, of all the\nFreedom of Information Act documents we have, almost none of them\nwere of the level of Top Secret or above. The highest good ones we\nhave are classified Secret and below. There\u2019s a couple of\ndocuments we have that were Top Secret, and they were all excised,\nblacked out or whited out, so you really cannot read what\u2019s\nin them.\n\n\n\nBut\nnevertheless, a lot of good information came out and during that\nperiod we learned about these airspace violations in the mid \u201970s.\n\n\nDuring\nthe late \u201970s, early \u201980s, there\u2019s overwhelming\nevidence to show that intelligence groups infiltrated UFO research\norganizations. They clearly did this earlier, as well, but my\nargument in this book is that circa 1979, 1980, there is an active\neffort by agencies once again to infiltrate the field, and to stir up\nthe mud and make it essentially a lot more difficult for us to know\nwhat direction is up and what is down.\n\n\nBut\nthere\u2019s more than this. One of the things that I brought into\nthis volume that I really did not do a lot of in my first book,\nbecause I do not think I was there mentally myself ten years\nago, is what I would now call the larger geopolitical realities.\n\n\nForget\nUFOs for a moment. I think that most people can now recognize that\nthe United States President is probably not the guy in charge of the\ncountry. Okay. So we all know this. So then the question becomes:\nWell, who or what is?\nAnd that\u2019s a harder question sometimes to answer.\n\n\n\nCertainly\nthis is not a question that I see getting raised in the standard\nhalls of academia. I do not see this raised in political science\ndepartments or history departments around the country or beyond. I\nthink that they are still stuck in a much more conventional\nmindset.\n\n\n\nBut\nthe fact is, what I try to do is analyze each of the Presidencies and\ntheir relationship to the elite organizations \u2013 the infamous\nBilderberg group, CFR, Trilateral, and so forth. Is there a\nrelationship? Well, the answer is absolutely, 100% yes.\nAbsolutely, yes. Not maybe,\nbut yes\n\u2013 and this is important.\n\n\n\nThe\nkingmaker of the United States for the past half century easily has\nbeen David Rockefeller. You do not get to be President until he\nsays you are going to be President.\n\n\n\nGerald\nFord was a five-time Bilderberg attendee back in The Sixties. He\ndid not just come out of nowhere to become the first unelected\nPresident in American history.\n\n\n\nJimmy\nCarter is probably, as most people in this room know, was lifted\nalmost directly by David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski and\ndropped into the White House. That\u2019s really the case.\n I mean, Jimmy Carter interviewed with them before he got\nthe Democratic Nomination. They were impressed by him; they said:\nYes, you are going to\nbe our man.\n\n\nBrzezinski,\nof course, became his National Security Adviser, and he\u2019s now,\nof course, one of the key advisers and point-men for Barack Obama.\nSome things never change.\n\n\nThe\ninfluence of the Trilateral Commission in the Carter administration\nwas actually much commented on at the time, and 1980 presidential\ncandidate Ronald Reagan made a lot of political capital out of this\nfact.\n\n\n\nRonald\nReagan, in 1980, sounded a lot like Ron Paul did last year, believe\nit or not -- he really did. Ronald Reagan campaigned in 1980 against\nthe elites, campaigned against the Council on Foreign Relations,\ncampaigned against George Herbert Walker Bush in that regard and said\nin fact: That man will\nnever be part of my administration.\n\n\nWell,\nit so happened that Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign manager was one\nWilliam Casey, a key leading CFR man and a close friend of the\nRockefellers, and all of that changed, obviously, when Ronald Reagan\nselected Bush as his running mate, causing a number of long-time\nReagan supporters to walk off the stage at the Republican Nomination,\nin fact.\n\n\n\nA\nmonth or two after that, in September of 1980, Ronald Reagan had a\npre-victory campaign party, September of \u201980, and seated to his\nright was David Rockefeller himself. So, that\u2019s how it all\nworks.\n\n\nI\nhave some points, even, that I make on the assassination attempt of\nRonald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr., son of John Hinckley Sr., who was\na very close friend of George Herbert Walker Bush -- a very\nclose friend.\n\n\n\nHinckley\u2019s\nolder brother, Scott Hinckley, that night, the night of the\nassassination attempt, was due to have lunch with Neil\nBush, son of the Vice\nPresident -- very interesting indeed, a confluence that major media\nreally did not delve into at all.\n\n\nOkay.\nMoving ahead, then, to other themes... Well, before I leave this,\nI\u2019ll just then say that the United States Presidency, as I\nargue, that the U.S. President, let me put it this way, is\nessentially a sales rep and his job is to sell you, really, two\nthings these days.\n\n\n\nThe\nfirst thing that he\u2019s got to sell you is globalization, which\nis a bitter pill for many Americans to swallow, so he\u2019s got to\nbe good at that.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthen the other pill he\u2019s got to make you swallow is whatever\nnew war comes down the pike, and they do this on behalf of\ninternational financial groups.\n\n\n\nOne\nof the other things that I will mention before moving on is that I\ndid a brief, but I think concise, analysis of the Gulf War. It\u2019s\nnot a UFO event per se,\nbut it\u2019s important. It\u2019s important in order for all of us\nto remind ourselves that we need to take the veil away and see our\npower structure for what it is, and the reason is that if we are\ninterested in what we call disclosure and openness from our\ngovernment, then we need to know exactly what that government is.\n\n\n\nWe\ncannot go through our lives rerunning our 5th grade civics class\nversion of the government in our mind. You know that version: You\nvote for your member of congress \u2013 this was all on Schoolhouse\nRock, if you lived\nthrough that \u2013 your member of congress, and then how a bill\nbecomes a law, and checks and balances, let us not forget that,\nand on and on and on.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s\nreally not our world anymore. we are in a different world and we\nneed to understand the true structure of power as it exists. So, this\nis an important part of what I try to do in this book.\n\n\nThe\nother aspect, we will loosely call it under politics, would be\nthe technological considerations. Again, asking a question which I\ndo not have a complete answer to this: the\nours versus theirs issue,\nso if you see a UFO -- who\nmade it? Did we make it? Did they make it?\n\n\nIt\u2019s\na hard issue always to resolve, at least in my own view. I try to\nlook at this by understanding what was the state of our official\ntechnological achievements at certain periods in the history of this?\nWhat were the possible states of achievement in the black world\n, in the covert world, in trying to piece this\ntogether.\n\n\nBlack\nbudget matters and privatization of the secrets also figure into my\nbook. What is the black budget? Well I think you all know. It\u2019s\nnot just classified federal spending, though.\n\n\n\nI\nthink there\u2019s a lot more that goes into what we call the black\nbudget. I think there\u2019s a great deal of what we would all call\nillegal money\ngoing into black budget, into what we would call Special\nAccess Programs or Waived\nSpecial Access Programs or Unacknowledged\nSpecial Access Programs. There\u2019s actually a whole host of other\nprogram names that I have come across in my research.\n\n\n\nThey\nhave little to no \u2013 let us say no\n\u2013 oversight by congress. They have little to no oversight,\nsometimes, by their own agencies, whether it\u2019s the Navy, Army,\nor Air Force, or any of the intelligence groups. Who knows who runs\nsome of these things?\n\n\n\nIt\nappears that there\u2019s a lot of illegal money flowing through,\nwhether that\u2019s narco-trafficking dollars or securities fraud,\nstock market fraud, you know, flowing through our government like the\nblood in your veins.\n\n\n\nAnd\nby privatization of the secrets, what I mean is... again, forgetting\nUFOs for the moment; I think it\u2019s not hard for all of us to see\nhow government agencies \u2013 and this is not simply the U.S. \u2013\nhave become completely dominated by private money. I think we can see\nthis. And so, it\u2019s also the case with the UFO secrets.\n\n\n\nOne\nof the points that I make \u2013 and some of this, not all of it,\ndoes come from a couple of sources that, unfortunately, I am\njust not at liberty to say who these people are \u2013 but I have\nbeen given information that I think is valid. It indicates a massive\nrunaway nature of the UFO secrets in the hands of private,\nsemi-public, but often very private interest groups.\n\n\n\nCertainly\nwhen you look at the Special Access Program \u2013 that whole world\n\u2013 the few studies that have been done on it do indicate that\nprivate contractors are the dominant partner, rather than DOD\npersonnel, who function for their part primarily as gatekeepers for\nmoney to flow in. But the actual decisions are run by, whether it\u2019s\nBoeing or Lockheed or SAIC or Raytheon or whoever is running the\nprograms, they are the dominant ones.\n\n\n\nAnd\nit makes sense because -- think about it: If you are a Pentagon\nFour-Star General, when you retire, who\u2019s going to hire you?\nWell, those companies will, at a nice cushy job making a lot of\nmoney; and all this revolving\ndoor that goes on.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nalso very much easier for keeping the secrets when you privatize\nthis, because the information then does not become classified --\nit becomes proprietary, which is a much, much better way to keep this\ninformation from the public, and it becomes profitable, of course.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou assume, as I do, as I have come to believe, that much of this\ninvolves retrieval of acquired technologies, exotic technology not\nmanufactured by human hands, so then you have got this little\nartifact that you have got to study and you may not be able to\nduplicate it right away, but you might after ten years come up with\nsome pretty nifty ideas on what you can do, and you have got a\ngreat money-maker there.\n\n\nSo\nreally, the incentive for giving the secrets up becomes less and less\nand less over the years. So, it naturally becomes private. Of course\nit does.\n\n\nSo,\nthe obvious conclusion \u2013 this is the kindergarten-level\nconclusion of the politics portions \u2013 is that there is an\nactive international cover-up of the core of the UFO phenomenon.\nThere\u2019s obviously much more that I try to say regarding that.\n\n\n\nBut\nagain, if there\u2019s a single take-away message, that would have\nto be it: It\u2019s a\nreal phenomenon and yes, Virginia, there is a cover-up.\n\n\nThe\nresearch... I\u2019ll get a little bit more into this. As I say,\nit\u2019s a history of UFOlogy, a fascinating bit of history. It's,\nin a sense, you might say that the history\u2019s a part of the\nhistory of the development of human consciousness.\n\n\n\nThink\nof it this way: we have had this phenomenon that\u2019s observed\nus for who knows how long, right? And it\u2019s really during, I\nbelieve, The Seventies and then The Eighties when researchers, in a\nsophisticated way, tried to understand who these other beings were.\nIt\u2019s our attempt, in a sense, to turn the tables and understand\nwho they were.\n\n\n\nSure,\nthere were researchers in The Fifties and Sixties. I do not really\nthink that researchers in The Fifties and Sixties were quite there in\nasking the kinds of questions that came up in The Seventies.\n\n\nSomething\nof an intellectual revolution in UFO research took place during these\nyears. A lot of new issues came up that had not existed before.\nThe whole concept of crash retrievals became big; there was a lot of\nresistance to it. It\u2019s a story, again, that I document, the\nstory of those people who tried to bring this issue to the fore and\nthose who said: No, that\u2019s\na lot of nonsense.\n\n\nIt\nwas a very heated issue \u2013 it still is, to a lesser extent. In\nThe Seventies and Eighties, it was a big issue; people got very upset\nover it  the topic of abductions, probably more so.\n\n\n\nYes,\nit had been known that there were probably isolated cases of what\nappeared to be abductions by aliens. Everyone knew about the Barney\nand Betty Hill case of 1961 and a few others. But, the idea back then\nwas: Well, do not be\nin the wrong place at the wrong time because if they see you, they\nmay just take you.\n\n\nWhat\nhappened during The Eighties was a completely different understanding\nof that phenomenon. People like Budd Hopkins, foremost among them,\nargued: No, no, that\u2019s\nnot how it is at all. This phenomenon appears to be very widespread,\nbased on my investigations, and seems even to run in families. People\nare repeatedly experiencing this phenomenon.\n\n\nIn\nother words, a kind of way of looking at it that, again, met a\ntremendous amount of resistance at the time.\n\n\nThe\nmutilation controversy really reared itself in a significant way\nduring this period. Again, there had been some cases of \u2018mutes\u2019\nin The Sixties, but they did not get a lot of attention until\nthe mid \u201970s and they have continued. Mutilation cases are\ndisturbing, fascinating.\n\n\n\nCrop\ncircles, not so disturbing but equally fascinating, came up as a\nmajor topic during this period of time.\n\n\nThe\nother thing to say about the research is the effect of the Internet\non research. We all know how the Internet has changed the world, and\nit certainly has. It also changed UFOlogy. What it really did is --\nstarting around 1987 -- it just caused UFOlogy to explode. That\u2019s\nbasically what happened.\n\n\n\nPrior\nto 1987, if you were an interested researcher in that topic, your\nvenues for expressing your ideas were very limited, basically. There\nwere some journals that were out there with a limited distribution.\nYou could try to create your own journal, which some people did, and\nhave an even more limited distribution. All the journals had their\nown editorial policies for submission, of course. You had to be\ncareful what you wrote. And that was about it.\n\n\nStarting\nin 1986 and 1987, we get the very beginnings of what we now would\ncall the Internet. Back then there was no World Wide Web, but there\nwere newsgroups, bulletin boards, and, in fact, the earliest\nnon-computer-programming bulletin board was dedicated to UFOs.\n\n\n\nThe\nUFO topic is one of the true pioneers of the Internet, and by 1987,\nit allowed people in this field to publish their thoughts without\nhaving to worry who was going to edit them \u2013 it just went out\nthere. And suddenly, they were getting more readers than those people\nwho\u2019d submitted their articles to the MUFON\nUFO Journal.\n\n\nSuddenly\nthe old guard of UFOlogy lost control over this domain. You could say\nthat\u2019s a good thing, you could say that\u2019s a bad thing,\nbut that\u2019s what happened, for better and for worse in fact,\nbecause after that, a flood of information then came out. And again,\na fascinating story.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthat\u2019s the story of the research. And the conclusions of the\nbook, let us just say, roughly speaking: The\nphenomenon is undeniable; the cover-up is undeniable. \n\n\nThere\u2019s\na confrontational nature to this phenomenon. There are many of them.\nMilitaries around the world have been chasing these things, not just\nthe American military. Now, that does not mean that we are\nthe bad guys or that we are the good guys \u2013 that\u2019s a\ndifferent issue. What it does mean, though, is that there is some\ntrouble in paradise. Someone\u2019s not getting along with someone\nelse -- that we can say.\n\n\nAbductions:\n In my assessment of this, there is no question there is an abduction\nphenomenon -- and it is NOT, as has been argued by some people,\nmostly notably Dr. Steven Greer -- simply a military phenomenon. In\nfact, I think it\u2019s irresponsible to make this argument. There\nis something...  Yes, you can clap for that. [applause\ncontinues]\n\n\nIt\nboggles my mind, to be perfectly candid here, that a researcher can\nmake such a blanket statement. You have a phenomenon that\u2019s\ngone on globally for a long time. You have individuals that are\ndescribing highly consistent things in terms of their abduction\nexperiences, and I do not know what else it can be other than a\nkind of religious-like zeal that can cause a person blindly to say\nthe only abductions that occur are military. This I find\nindefensible, and I think that a careful review of the evidence\ncertainly leads to that conclusion.\n\n\nAnother\nconclusion that I draw in this book is the runaway nature of the\nblack budget and, in a sense, what I have come to call a\nBreakaway Civilization.\nWhat do I mean by that? Let me explain.\n\n\nIn\nthe course of human history, we have had multiple civilizations\ncoexisting at the same time. Go back a thousand years \u2013 the\ncivilization of China was very different from the civilization of the\nNear East or of Europe or of North or South America.\n\n\n\nOver\nthe course of the last millennia, of course, these civilizations have\nincreasingly come to merge and to interact with each other. In a\nsense, the story of our civilization is the coming together of these\nvarious cultures and civilizations, and yet we have this history of\nseparate coexisting civilizations, so it\u2019s really not a new\nconcept.\n\n\n\nEven\nduring the Cold War, certainly the scientific infrastructures of the\nUnited States and the Soviet Union did not share their\ninformation with each other all that much, right? The Soviets had\nthis belief in the theories of a fellow named Trofim\nLysenko -- utterly\nabsurd biological theories, but the Soviet scientists held to this as\na part of state dogma through The Sixties. So my point here is that\nwe have examples of separate scientific infrastructures.\n\n\n\nWhat\nI am suggesting in this book is that what we call the Black\nWorld \u2013 existing as\nit does with, essentially, an infinite amount of money to play with,\nfor all intents and purposes, and an incredible amount of secrecy\nwithin which to perform what they do -- really no oversight  what\nwould actually happen if after, as is inevitably the case, a couple\nof brilliant genius Black World scientists stumbled across a new\nscientific reality based on these technologies that they are\nlooking over? They come up with some really super-nifty ideas.\n\n\n\nWould\nthey share it with the rest of us? We have this idea that there\u2019s\na spin-off technology involved, but is it necessarily so?\n\n\nAnd\nwhat happens \u2013 as always is the case with science, where one\nbreakthrough leads to another one, which leads to yet another one \u2013\nthe next thing, before you know it, they are up here and the\nrest of us are down here and that gap may in fact continue to\nincrease to the point where they have the ability to do things that\nwe would consider absolutely impossible.\n\n\n\nThey\nwould be so different that with justice we can call them a separate,\nor what I call Breakaway\nCivilization, with a completely different understanding of certain\nscientific principles, and certainly a different world view, because\nvery likely, as I believe, they are interacting in a much more\nup-close and personal way with \u201cthem\u201d  than we\nare, so they have a different set of principles by which they live\ntheir lives.\n\n\n\nYou\nhave to wonder how would they even be able to talk to us easily about\nwhat they know? Just as if we were to be time travelers going back a\nthousand years, how would we talk to people of any society of a\nthousand years ago? How would be able to tell them the things that we\nknow? It might be difficult.\n\n\n\nI\nthink that\u2019s something that we need to consider that\u2019s\nalready happened.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll\ndo a little quick glimpse into my forthcoming book, Volume 3, which I\nhave tentatively subtitled The\nFight for Disclosure, and\nit will cover the year 1992 to the present.\n\n\n\nReally,\nnearly all of my research for that is done. It\u2019s one reason it\ntook this book so long, is I ended up doing research for Volumes 2\nand 3 all at once, so I think it'll be a lot less time for me to do\nthis book.\n\n\n\nThese\nare just, off the top of my head on the plane flying here, my\nthoughts on how this book is going to come together. The Internet\nrevolution, obviously... I do not think it needs to be again\nsaid here. What also happened in The Nineties is an explosion of\nreported UFO sightings. It\u2019s incredible.\n\n\n\nGo\nto the National UFO Reporting Center on the web run by Peter\nDavenport, and you\u2019ll find  he catalogs about 5,000 UFO\nsightings each year. Now, most of these do not get investigated,\nclearly. they are what you\u2019d call raw reports, but they are\npretty interesting.\n\n\n\nI,\nmyself, investigated two cases out of that database and I came away\nfeeling that both of those were legitimate. I am not saying all\nof these cases are legitimate, but I think a lot of them probably\nare.\n\n\nThe\nfact is that in our own age, it\u2019s easier and easier now to\nreport this. There\u2019s no official government body that you can\nreport this to, which is a failure of our republic \u2013 very much\nso \u2013 because, frankly, if you encounter what is the most\namazing thing you have ever seen in your life, one would think\nthere should be an agency in your government that is charged with\ndealing with it.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s\nwhy the government is supposed to be responsive to you, right? And\nyet there is not any. But yet, there are places on the Web and\nit\u2019s easier and easier to report it, so there\u2019s an\nenormous amount there.\n\n\n\nThere\nhas been the release not just of some legitimate documents. Really,\nthe glory age of freedom of information, I think, was in the late\n\u201970s, but what we have had since then are continued\nreleases of official documents, but also the release of a lot of\ndisputed documents. These are the so-called Majestic\ndocuments \u2013 you can read all of them at the website of\nRyan and Bob Wood [ www.majesticdocuments.com\n].\n\n\n\n\nI\nthink that a very good case can be made for the authenticity of many\nof those documents; but, the point is that they are disputed.\nWhat that means is they are of unknown provenance, and again, it\nserves to muddy the waters of this field. I think it\u2019s\nimportant that we continue to try to do research on those documents\nto try to authenticate them or not.\n\n\nThere\nhave been a lot of initiatives in The Nineties and in our own century\ntoward Disclosure. I\u2019ll deal with the Rockefeller Initiative,\nthe whole Roswell GAO \u2013 General Accounting Office \u2013\nfiasco of the early \u201990s under\nthe Clinton years.\n\n\n\nThe\nefforts of Dr. Steven Greer in The Nineties leading up to his press\nconference in 2001 are very important; the efforts of my friend,\nStephen Basset, I think figure into this equation; the Sci-Fi/ John\nPodesta event of a\ncouple of years ago \u2013 all of these are important.\n\n\n\nIn\nother words, what I think we are seeing is very much an increase\nin the attempts now for citizen groups publicly to grab this issue\nand make major statements about the need to end the cover-up \u2013\nmuch, much greater than had ever happened in the past; much, much\nmore so.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s\nalso a very significant part \u2013 and this conference is obviously\na very strong reflection of this \u2013 is the growth of what we\nmight call higher\nconsciousnesses attitudes\nwithin the UFO community. Back in The Eighties and Seventies, there\nwas a little bit of this. If you go back further to The Fifties,\ncertainly what we could call the contactees\nwould be considered sort of \u201cNew Agey\u201d for their time,\nwithout a doubt.\n\n\n\nBut\nreally, I think this is a different order of magnitude, what we have\nbeen experiencing through The Nineties. l think it\u2019s probably\nconnected with greater communication through avenues like the\nInternet. Certainly, it\u2019s an important part of what\u2019s\ngoing on, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019ll need to deal with\nin an appropriate way in my book.\n\n\nThe\nother big thing, geopolitically, is the death of the nation-state,\nthe New World Order. Okay? This is probably the greatest\nunremarked-upon -- at least in the mainstream -- event of our\nlifetimes, at least geopolitically. Nations? I do not even know\nwhat a nation is anymore. Do they even exist? If groups of people\n living with the same language in an area... is that a nation?\n\n\n\nWho's\nsovereign? Are you sovereign? Are we sovereign in our country? Well,\nwe are in theory and we must continue to fight for this. In reality,\nour world has become something very different, and this has got to be\npart of any study of the UFO realities in the last 20 years because,\nagain, we have to understand the true nature of the structure of\npower.\n\nA\nnew Exopolitics; well,\nmaybe that\u2019s an overly-dramatic statement. Look, any time we are\ngoing to talk about Exopolitics \u2013 that is, the relationship of\nus and them -- well, those are the two variables, us\nand them,\nand we have to have a clear understanding of both of these variables\nto be able to talk intelligently about what we will call Exopolitics.\nIt\u2019s got to be done.\n\n\nSo,\nthrough all of this, as well, it is essential \u2013 absolutely\nessential \u2013 that we ask ourselves: How\ndo we know what we know? What is our source of data? And who are we\nsaying this to?\n\n\nWhat\nI mean here is that if we are going to be talking about other\nentities in the galactic civilization, we\u2019d better damn-well\nback up what we say with something other than: I\ngot this through a remote-viewed bit of information or through direct\ncontact with an alien being.\n\n\nI am\nvery sorry. That\u2019s not enough. It may be enough in a private\nconversation with other researchers, if that\u2019s what you\nbelieve.\nEveryone\u2019s entitled to have their beliefs; I speculate all the\ntime. But, we do ourselves a disservice as a community when we go\nfast and loose with this kind of thing. we have got to be more\ndisciplined with how we speak to the world.\n\n\nHow\nwould it be if, when you get an opportunity to say what we are\nbelieving to a larger media organization, we go just off with this\nand look ridiculous? we are not in a position where we really\ncan afford to do that. We have to be more careful.\n\n\nWe\ncan speculate, but we must distinguish between what we know\nand what we believe.\nthey are not the same. It\u2019s not hard to do \u2013 it just\nmeans qualifying one\u2019s statements a little bit, okay? I do not\nthink that\u2019s asking too much.\n\n\n\nlet us\nlook at us\na little bit, let us understand who we are. What we have had\nis a situation where we have been retrieving exotic technologies.\nNow, there\u2019s a big statement by me, I grant. It is something\nthat I believe I back up sufficiently in my book. There has been a\ngreat deal of information on this. Everyone knows about the Roswell\ncase, and there have been many others, frankly.\n\n\n\nThese\ntechnologies \u2013 this is my hypothesis here, okay? \u2013 have\nto be kept secret. you have\ngot a cold war going on back in those days \u2013 we\ncannot let the Russians see what we have got \u2013\nrequiring secret\nbudgetary appropriations, i.e. the creation of a black budget.\n\n\nThe\nUFO phenomenon is almost certainly the key factor in the creation of\nthe black budget world that we have today. Not the only one, but one\nof the key motivators, I think.\n\n\n\nPrivatization...\nI am just going to have to run through this... runaway\ntechnological achievements: This\nis our secret infrastructure. That\u2019s part of us. \n\n\nOkay.\nWhen most of us \u2013 I am excluding the present company here\n\u2013 but I think most people go through our lives with the\nassumption that we get our sources of information from, like, the\nmedia; and that would include TV, but also Internet.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave a political system. We have an academic community in which there\nis a back-and-forth kind of exchange there, so that they also are\nresponsive to us, in theory. The media, of course, we are told:\nWell, they give the public\nwhat the public wants.  \n\n\nAnd\nthe academic world, of course, is supposed to be responsive to the\ninherent value of truth and there\u2019s a back and forth there. The\npolitical system\u2019s supposed to be responsive to us: Throw\nthe bums out, and so\nforth.\n\n\n\nHow\nis it really? Well this is how I think things have actually shaped\nup. The arrow\u2019s going one way here. [referring to overhead\npicture] It\u2019s going at you.\nAnd it\u2019s not just media and the politics and the academics.\nThere\u2019s a corporate\nsystem in place. This is\nsomething that Exopolitical analysis does not fully get.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\ngreat to talk about personal transformation, but we live in a world\nof corporations and they do not give a crap about personal\ntransformation. they are driven by profit and shareholder value.\nThat\u2019s all they care about. They can be driven by beautiful\npeople who really do care about the world, but if they are not\nincreasing shareholder value, they are gone.\n\n\n\n\nCorporations\nhave an iron law in which they must\nincrease shareholder value. That is their raison\nd\u2019etre.\nIf they are not doing that, then the CEO is gone, which means\nthat they must behave in certain ways, and those certain ways,\nunfortunately, are not typically designed to increase higher\nconsciousness among the people. They are, instead, designed to take\nmoney out of your bank account. That\u2019s what they do!\n\n\nThat\u2019s\nour world, and there\u2019s a great deal of interaction between\nthose major worlds, and there\u2019s other branches I probably could\nhave thought of if I had more time.\n\n\nUnder\na rubric, though, of an elite\n\u2013 yes, there is an elite. I do not know what to call them\nanymore. I used to call them the National Security State. Well,\nthey are not quite national.\n\n\n\nthey are\na little bit more than that, aren\u2019t they? International\nFinancial Maximum Security State... toss in Entertainment State. [Ed\ncomment: The \u201celite\u201d are the Supranational\nSovereignty of an Intellectual Elite and World Bankers;\nthis term was coined by David Rockefeller in 1991, when he thanked a\ngathering of the Bilderberg attendees for their dedicated efforts to\nconceal and cover up the truth of who the elite really are.]\n\n\nIf\nyou looked at America as a room of 100 people, okay? And if there\u2019s\n$100 in the room \u2013 assuming the dollar\u2019s still worth\nsomething when we do this \u2013 one of those guys would own $40 to\n$45 of those dollars. That\u2019s America. That\u2019s the world,\nreally. And then another guy would have another $11 bucks, and then\nthe last 80 people would have really nothing.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthat\u2019s the room that has a political system; it\u2019s got a\nmedia, it\u2019s got all these things that make it go. It\u2019s\nnot hard, really, to figure out who\u2019s going to be in the best\nposition to manipulate all of these things for his own benefit.\nObviously, it's the guy with the $40, $45 bucks.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s\nour world. It\u2019s not complicated, and yet, of course, it\u2019s\nnever analyzed in this way in our mainstream media, precisely because\nthey are owned by that guy with the $45 bucks.  So, we\nhave to disabuse ourselves of the notion that we have a truly open\nprocess in any way. We do not. It\u2019s not.\n\n\nAnd\nthis matters when we talk about UFO Disclosure, because does not\nit matter, if you get Disclosure from your government, what the\nnature of that government is? If it\u2019s a Republican system [i.e.\nConstitutional Republic] that is responsive to you, that\u2018s one\nthing, but what if it\u2019s a proto-crypto-post-modern fascist\nstate instead?\n\n\n\nWell,\nguess what? It is! we are not moving toward democracy, and by\nthe way, as I said earlier today, I do not think democracy is\nbad. What I think is uninformed citizens of a democracy is a very,\nvery dangerous thing.\n\n\n\nAre\nwe moving toward a world of slaves and slave owners? Yes, we are.\nThat\u2019s the direction. Escape into your own little private\nIdaho, where you can play your video games and watch TV and zone out.\nIt\u2019s a lot more fun, frankly, than dealing with all the stuff\nwe have to deal with. If your house is on fire, but you are\nhaving a really wicked-cool dream, who wants to wake up  and\ndeal with the crisis?\n\n\nWhat\nis our world moving toward? we have decoded the human genome.\nwe are making amazing strides right now in the world of\nnanotechnology, what will be called quantum computing, artificial\nintelligence, creation of a super race? Maybe. Getting rid of\nredundant people like us? There\u2019s that word... you hear that\nword a lot these days: redundant.\nis not that scary? It scares me. People are not redundant.\n\n\nSo,\nwe are in a post-modern dystopia. we are depleting our\nresources -- we all know this; threatened cascading failure of the\nglobal ecosystem  failing global infrastructures. Is there an\nendgame scenario being discussed by those people in the know? Are\nthey planning something? Other people have discussed this earlier.\nI am going to let you just ponder that one yourself.\n\n\nNow\nlet us look at them.\nWho are they? How can we learn about them? This should always be at\nthe forefront of our thinking.\n\n\nWell,\nwe can learn a little bit about them through reviewing some of the\nUFO sighting literature. There are many cases of people who have\ndescribed... I mean, seemingly honest, very, very low-key people have\nsaid: Yes, I had an\nencounter with a being that... I do not think they were human.\nThere\u2019s a lot of that and we can learn a lot from that.\n\n\nAbduction\nliterature, yes, also, but let us be careful, and the only\nreason I say that is because when people are taken, or seem to be\ntaken, it\u2019s not under the best of circumstances and there\ncertainly seems to be a lot of manipulation going on there.\n\n\nExperiencers,\nremote viewers, yes, but we have to be very careful. Let us not be\nirresponsible. I\u2019ll leave it at that because I am running\nshort.\n\n\nWho\nare they? Here\u2019re a few factors about them: They operate by\nstealth, at least usually. They do not seem to be that\ninterested in letting us deal with them in an open, public way. I\nthink, personally, that there\u2019s more than one group involved,\nwith diverse agendas, probably.\n\n\n\n\nAccording\nto abduction and other kinds of research, they are highly\ntelepathic. They have an ability to manipulate human thinking, human\nemotions, as do, in fact, a lot of current military covert\ntechnologies.\n\n\nThey\nappear to have some mastery over space-time. They do not seem to\nhave the kinds of emotional responses that we do, at least not most\nof the time. Do they look like us? I think some would suggest, well,\nmaybe they do. It would be logical, if I were an alien here on Earth,\nif I wanted to deal with the native species, I would probably enhance\nor manipulate my own native humans and have them do work from me.\n\n\nWhere\nare they from? Are they from another planet? Are they from another\ntime? Are they from another dimension? I do not know, I do not\nknow, do not know.\n\n\nAre\nthey truthful or not? Ah! Okay. Again, let us pretend that we are\ntime travelers. You go back a thousand years, you talk to the most\nintelligent person in the world a thousand years ago, let us\nsay, I do not know, some monk in an abbey who happens to be a\ngenius. You sit down with this person for a day and you try to\ndescribe our world.\n\n\n\nHow\nmany mental revolutions is that person going to be able to handle\nbefore they just say: I\ncannot take it.\nOkay? Probably not too many. Tell them that the Earth goes around the\nsun, or that there are these little things called viruses, or, you\nknow, all kinds of technological capabilities. There\u2019s only a\ncertain amount that a person can handle.\n\n\n\nIf\nthey are coming here to deal with us, I think it\u2019s\nreasonable to assume that they are not telling us everything,\neither.\n\n\nDid\nthey create us? Did they manipulate us? Did they enhance us? If so,\ndo they see us as their investment? Do they see us as their property?\nHow long has this been going on?\n\n\nThere\u2019re\nfallacies involved here. Here\u2019s a fallacy: If\nthey are so technologically advanced, they must have solved\ntheir major social, economic, and political problems. You\nhear this a lot. I hear it a lot. I do not buy it at all.\n\n\nAgain,\nwe go back in time. let us say all of us go back, with our\niPods, and our cell phones, and maybe a couple of laptops. It does not\nmatter where we go. We meet some people of a thousand years ago and\nthey look at this laptop and they are like: Whoa,\nman, that\u2019s cool! For you to have gotten to this level, you\nmust have solved all of your social, economic, and political\nproblems! \n\n\n\nAnd\nthen, right, we would look at each other, we\u2019d say: Well,\nokay, you take care. Oh, and keep that on \u201csafety\u201d,\nyou know. Whatever. \n\n\nOkay?\nThey may not have either. In fact, when you really think about it, if\nyou look at the species that we know of on Earth, it\u2019s only the\nhighest intellectual species \u2013 us \u2013 that has the ability\nto be sadistic, that tortures. Maybe the higher up the ladder you go,\nthe greater the range, from the angelic to the truly demonic? And,\nagain, maybe that\u2019s the case with them. I do not know.\n\n\nAre\nthey ready to welcome us with open arms to the cosmos? This is a\nstatement, I admit... This is what Dr. Steven Greer actually,\nliterally, said at Barcelona a couple of months ago. I watched it on\nYouTube thinking: W-h-a-a-t?\nI am sorry. I beg to differ. I beg to differ. \n\n\nThere\u2019s\na Disclosure Paradox here: It\u2019s\nimpossible, it can never happen, but it\u2019s inevitable.\n\n\nlet us\ntalk about some of the fallout of Disclosure. These are some, and\ncertainly not all, of the issues that a true Disclosure\u2019s going\nto have to deal with: Why\nhave we been chasing them? Why is this confrontation going on? How\nhave you been able to keep this secret, Mr. President? What does that\nsay about the structure of our secrecy?\n\n\nOh,\nthat\u2019s going to be a lot of fun to talk about.\n\n\n\nWhat\nare all these secret programs about? Is there a secret space program?\nThat might a tough one for the President or any other responsible\nagency to discuss. Yeah,\nwe actually are going off-world, people, and we have been going\nto Mars and the Moon for \u201cx\u201d number of years.\n\n\nYou\nknow, a lot of people might be a little upset about that, having paid\nfor a program that they may not have known about and might have\nwanted some control over.\n\n\nAnd\nthen, dealing with who these other beings are may not be an easy\nissue, understanding why they are interested in us.\n\n\n\nThere\nwill be challenges -- I guarantee you -- to the structures of power\nin this world, politically, finance, industry; all of these. I will\nnot have time to go through these. This was an expansion of what I\nwas just telling you.\n\n\n\nI\nwill just pause here, though: Their\ninterest in us. Why are\nthey interested in us? Well, it\u2019s not that hard for me to see\nthis one. This is an easy one.\n\n\n\nA\nhundred years ago we had horses pulling carts. That was our world one\nhundred years ago. we are now at the verge of having your\ncomputer be as intelligent as you are. This is the latest from AI\nexperts. In ten years, they say, your computer will have the full\ncomputational power of one human brain. That\u2019s a major\nmilestone.\n\n\n\nAnd\nof course, once they achieve that, they are going to surpass\nthat. You\u2019ll wake up and you\u2019ll chat with your computer.\nYour computer will sound like a person except, well, it\u2019ll be a\nlittle bit smarter than us, you know? Do a quadrillion number of\ncalculations per second or pull any data off the Internet like that\n, so... a really good personal assistant.\n\n\n\nlet us\nhope they do not pull a Terminator,\nor Matrix,\nor an I, Robot\non us.\n\n\n\nThe\npoint that I am making is that we are about to reinvent our\nwhole civilization. Other intelligent species that are looking at\nthis must be able to know this. They must be able to know that we are\nabout to leap into their world. we have actually been in their\nworld all along; we have only been asleep. Now, it is time for us\nto wake up.\n\n\nMany,\nmany, many Disclosure problems \u2013 where do you want to start?\nHow do you undo a lie this big without angering so many people,\nwithout threatening your own status?\n\n\n\nThink\nback just a little more than two decades ago to Gorbachev and his\nglasnost\nwhich, six years later, ended the Soviet Union. The spiral of reform\nbecame too much. It just got out of his control. You start talking\nabout openness, and suddenly, the Baltic States say: Great,\nwe do not want to be in your country anymore.\nRemember how you took us\nover in 1940? Oh yeah,\nthat. Right. we are\ngone. Okay.\n\n\n\nSo,\nwhat would happen after 60-plus years of the UFO secret? Would there\nbe a spiraling out of control? It might start off real manageable; it\nmight not end that way. Would there be vigilantes? let us\nget the aliens. you are an alien.\n\n\nWhat\nif we got free energy? Everyone talks about free energy like it\u2019s\ngoing to be the greatest thing. What if it is not? We used to\nhave free energy \u2013 it was called oil. Oil, I mean, for all\nintents and purposes was free for a long time and we did things with\noil that really were not all that heartwarming to the Earth.\n\n\n\nNow,\nit\u2019s true that with free energy, we might not have to hack down\nthe whole global ecosystem. You might be able to heat your home\nforever for free, I guess. You might be able to make a really neat\nbomb, too, and blow up the Pacific Ocean with that same source of\nenergy, if it\u2019s not tightly controlled. I do not know.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019re\na lot of possibilities here. The Fire\nof Prometheus can be good\nand bad, and again, I am not arguing that we should not\nmove ahead. We have no choice. History is bigger than we are. Read\nTolstoy, he\u2019ll prove it to you \u2013 history is bigger.\nThings are going to happen and we are going to get it. It\u2019s\ngoing to happen, but it may not be fun. It may not be easy.\n\n\nAnd\nin the short term, all right, if we discover through the secrets\nthat, well, there\u2019s a better version of petroleum, we do not\nneed that \u2013 hey, that\u2019s great. Steel? Pfff. Awesome...\nwe have got this nano-tektite, whatever. Electronics?\n\n\nWell,\nokay. In the long run, this is fabulous; in the short run, it will\nmean major financial disruptions. How long will that last? Ten years?\nMore? It will not be fun, or it may\nnot be fun, certainly not for those elites who may own those\nindustries.\n\n\n\nBut,\nit may not be fun for us, either. It\u2019s going to be a bumpy\nride, and nevertheless, it will happen. They cannot stop this.\nYou cannot stop history. The pace of change is so rapid, it\u2019s\nso revolutionary -- it will not be stopped.\n\n\nBill\nJoy, the co-founder of\nSun\nMicrosystems, was very\nconcerned, is concerned, over the runaway nature of Artificial\nIntelligence, and is afraid of a kind of Terminator-like\nscenario, or some other equally-bad thing that may happen, and for a\nnumber of years, has been calling to other executives to try to slow\ndown or even stop the development of advanced AI.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nimpossible. It\u2019s spitting into the wind; you cannot win.\nThere\u2019re always going to be forces that will... let us\ntweak this program here; we will fix this software here.\nIt\u2019s going to happen, and it\u2019s the same with Disclosure.\n\n\n\nwe are\nin a very unstable period of our history, it\u2019s like\neverything\u2019s bouncing around. That is exactly my view of the\ntype of environment in which some monumental mistake will occur in\nwhich the secrets will come out in some way. I do not know how.\nI do not know what the trigger will be, but it\u2019s going to\nhappen. When, I do not know either. I predict within ten years.\n\n\nNow,\nwhen it happens, there\u2019s going to be attempts, you know this,\nto control the spin.\nOkay? It\u2019s going to happen, and so it\u2019s going to be our\njob, the job of any responsible researcher \u2013 and your job -- to\nensure that that does not happen.\n\n\n\nwe have\ngot to make sure that the actual truth comes out, even if it\u2019s\nhorrible, even if it\u2019s horrible \u2013 especially\nif it\u2019s horrible. There\u2019s no other way we are going\nto be able to deal with the reality, until we learn the full import\nof what is going on.\n\n\n\nAt\nthe bottom here, I see not one enemy, but maybe two, maybe several.\nBy that, I mean the enemy is not just the national security\nstate which has been hiding this information from us for all these\nyears... they are\na problem to deal with.\n\n\n\nBut,\nthere may be some extraterrestrial, or interdimensional, or non-human\nintelligences that may not be working toward our best interests. If\nwe do not acknowledge that, at least as a distinct possibility,\nI think we are fools.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave to, even if their intentions may not be bad. What happens to\nindigenous cultures when they encounter a\nhighly-technically-proficient society? We know. It may be in the long\nrun  things get better for them. I do not know. You can\ndecide that for yourself, but the point is that we have to be\nvigilant against a variety of fronts here.\n\n\n\nHope\nand fear: Fear is an\nenemy. We know this\nbecause when we are afraid, we react irrationally to things, we do not\nthink through. Hope is an enemy, too, though. That sounds kind of\nwrong,\ndoes not it? Everyone likes to have hope: do not\ngive up hope. But, here\u2019s\nthe problem with hope: Hope\nalso deludes. \n\n\nWe\nneed to have a cold eye. We have to be able to look at reality in as\nalert and awake a fashion as we can. This is why I love the title of\nthis conference: Awake and\nAware. That is exactly\nright.\n\n\n\nWhat\nis true higher consciousness? Well, it starts with awareness, with\nseeing things as they are, not as you want them to be, not as you\nhope they can be \u2013 you have to see them as they are. It is only\nthrough going over that first large hurdle, I feel, that we can\nreally attain a true higher consciousness, a true awareness in which\nwe are awake, not asleep.\n\n\nKerry\noften writes in her emails: Awaken\nthe dreamer! I think that\nis exactly the attitude that we all must have. we have been in a\ndream state and we have to wake up.\n\n\nThat\u2019s\neverything. Thank you very much. \n\n\nIf\nyou have any questions, you can go to my website:\n\n\n\n\n\nWow.\nThank you. Thank you very, very much. \n\n\nI\njust want to say that I have, unfortunately, a limited number of\nbooks here. I will be at my table in the back, right outside there,\nand if you are interested in the new book, I have it. I\u2019ll be\nglad to sign it for you. If I run out, they are easily available\non my website or through amazon.com.\n\n\nThanks\nvery much. \n\n\nKC:\n Richard, thank you.\n\n\nBR:\n Thank you so much!\n\n\nRD:\n Thank you.\n\n\n[applause\ncontinues]\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nKERRY\nCASSIDY (KC):  we are very honored to have Alex Collier join us.\nThis is pretty much unprecedented. He does not speak, as you may\nknow, often or even has in quite some time.\n\n\n\nSo\nI just wanted to say that I got a message over a year ago that the\nAndromedans wished to speak and that they wished Alex Collier to come\nto Camelot and that we could provide a service or a platform for\nthat. So we have been working to have that happen. It\u2019s\ntaken quite some time.\n\n\n\nwe are\nreally happy that this can happen today and we just want to say thank\nyou very much for making this possible to the hidden beings here and\naround us at this time.\n\n\n\nSo,\nAlex, I am actually not going to give you a big introduction\nbeyond that today. I am going to let you speak for yourself.\n\n\n\nLadies\nand Gentlemen, Alex Collier. \n\n\nALEX\nCOLLIER (AC):  Can you all hear? All right. Great. I want to thank\nall the speakers. I was at home yesterday watching the streaming and\nGod, they were just... you know, George Green, and just all of the\nspeakers \u2013 just fantastic. They give so much.\n\n\nI\nknow that all of you here give so much and you try in your own way to\nshare the Light. I mean, there\u2019s two ways to be the Light \u2013\none is to be the candle and the other is the mirror that reflects the\ncandle.\n\n\n\nWe\nlive in an extraordinary time on Earth. I mean, absolutely\nextraordinary. In the next several years, you are all going to\nthink you are living in a science fiction movie. You are living\nin a science fiction movie, except it is not a movie, it\u2019s\nreality.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou want information on me, I think there\u2019s some on the Web,\nboth pro and con.\n\n\n\nI am\njust going to get right into it. I am going to give you some\nupdates and then we are going to talk about some things that I\nwas specifically asked to speak to you about from Morenae.\n\n\n\n\nEinstein\nsaid: You cannot solve the\nproblems of the world with the same thinking that created them,\nand that is no more relevant than it is today. We have enormous\nproblems, or challenges \u2013 I should say: challenges\n\u2013 that take enormous amounts of brainstorming and solutions.\n\n\n\nThe\ndifficulty in trying to solve some of the issues that we have is the\nfact that we do not have all the data. The two gentlemen that were up\nhere prior to, alluded to that. So did Robert Dean; Mr. Green; Bill\nand Kerry have; so many of the speakers, as we keep trying to go\nforth and gather all the information to try to solve this out.\n\n\nI,\nlike many of the other speakers and each of you, have a small piece\nof the puzzle. Now, we are going to talk about some of that\ntoday.\n\n\n\nI\nknow that there\u2019s an awful lot of talk about Disclosure. I know\nthat in the Exopolitics community, there\u2019s a great deal of talk\nabout Disclosure.\n\n\n\nI\npersonally do not believe the United States government\u2019s\never going to admit it. It\u2019ll probably come from another\ncountry, India or China, first. Or the extraterrestrials themselves\nare going to show themselves and just say: Hey,\nthis charade\u2019s gone on long enough,\nwhich is probably the highest probability at this point. We will talk\nabout some of that today.\n\n\nI\nhad honed my presentation for an hour because that\u2019s what I\nthought I had, so in talking about solving the problems, at the very\ntop of our power structure, the planet Earth lives in a pyramidal\npower structure.\n\n\n\nExtraterrestrial\ncivilizations no longer use that power structure \u2013 the\npyramidal power structure. They have been using a holographic ever\nsince the end of the Orion Wars -- which would be in our linear time\nabout 360,000 years ago.\n\n\n\nSince\nthen, most of the civilized, benevolent civilizations, including some\nof the rogue regressive groups \u2013 and they are a minority \u2013\nhave been using a holographic social structure, and we are going\nto talk about that today.\n\n\n\nwe are\nalso going to talk about creating a new Domain\nof Knowing, a space in\nwhich we can create an opportunity for Earth to be mentored, because\nwe need some help here. We are a little bit in over our heads.\n\n\n\nSo,\nit takes me a little while to warm up here; I am a little rusty.\n\n\n\nAs\nof the last several days, much of the Cassini project has been\nclassified. The reason for that is because of all the mother ship\nactivity that has now been filmed and documented in the Saturnian\nsystem, around Saturn.\n\n\n\nWe\nalso have, a million-and-a-half miles off of the South Pole, a\n20-mile craft that has sat and is stationary. NASA and other\norganizations\u2019 telescopes have been monitoring it for eight\nmonths. They watch its trajectory to us. It is now stationary and\nthere are craft going in and out of this 20-mile structure. I do not\nknow any more about it than that.\n\n\n\nI\nalso want you to know that there is a very large planetary structure\ncoming in, 18 degrees right ascension of Neptune\u2019s orbit. It\nshould be visible sometime in the next year.\n\n\n\nThere\nis an awful lot going on and, of course, you are all paying the\nbills and no one\u2019s being told anything about it.\n\n\n\nNow,\nit goes far deeper than spooking\nthe herd. That is really\nnot the intention here at all.\n\n\n\nThe\nintention here, and what\u2019s really been going on, is simply\nthis: Bob Dean made a reference yesterday to almost feeling sorry for\nthe government about the situation that they are in. I would\nhave to concur with him on that, in the fact that the government made\nsome treaties, cut some deals for technology, in exchange for\nexperimentation and observation... and they were tricked.\n\n\n\nThey\nreally did not know what they were getting themselves into, and now\nthe hand has been dealt.\n\n\n\nThere\nare many people within the UFO community that say that all the\nextraterrestrials are benevolent. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is in my\nown personal opinion, and based on the knowledge that I have, that\nthat is completely irresponsible to say. \n\n\n\nWe\nlive in a duality, because if it was all love and light, we would not\nbe going down this road to global fascism and the Powers That Be\nwanting to eliminate two-thirds of the world\u2019s population. That\nis not love and light.\n\n\n\nSo,\nwe have a lot of things to cover, and a lot of things are going to be\noccurring.\n\n\n\nThe\neconomic situation is what it is. Mr. Green gave a fantastic\npresentation yesterday. There is absolutely nothing that I disagree\nwith him about. He made a reference to buying gold and silver. I\nthink that\u2019s a really good idea. However, you cannot eat gold\nand silver.\n\n\n\nIt\nis imperative that you start storing food and I will tell you simply\nwhy. If they do crash the dollar, which they are going to do in order\nto create a global currency and a global government, you will not\nbe able to buy food. He made reference to the currency being devalued\nsix-to-one in the next several months. Gasoline will go to $18, $20 a\ngallon. Truckers will not be able to deliver products. What you have\nis what you\u2019ll have.\n\n\n\nIt\nis imperative to, if you can, start forming within your community,\ncommunity gardens, figuring it out. You need to start talking about\nthis.\n\n\n\nI\nknow most people are simply not open to it. Just do the best you can.\nI mean, we are all fighting the fight.\n\n\n\nNow,\nAmerica is on the front line of this and the reason is simple.\nAmerica created a new Domain\nof Knowing. America was\ncreated to get rid of the aristocracy of the Old World, to create\nsomething new, to create individual liberties, to create personal\nfreedoms. That was never known in the world before.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave that, and because of our apathy, we have lost virtually all of\nthose. It is no one else\u2019s fault. It is our own fault.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave known since The Sixties that the CIA has been trafficking\nnarcotics. We know this. We have known that the CIA has been\nassassinating and overthrowing governments.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave known that there\u2019s been a cover-up of what there is on the\nMoon and inside our Solar System. We know this. We know that there is\nextraterrestrial life. We know this. That is no longer the\ndiscussion. We know that the government has become corrupt.\n\n\nThe\npeople \u2013 the personages \u2013 that rule the planet are not\nus.\nThey are not human beings.\nAnd I will say this with my very last breath: They are not us.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwhat happened was that they took over because they think\nholographically. It was very easy to get around the pyramidal power\nstructure on Earth because it\u2019s completely obsolete everywhere\nelse out there.\n\n\n\nSo,\nif you come in using a holograph, using holographic thinking, what\nyou do is you create your structure everywhere so no matter what\nhappens, whether one group gets taken out, another group gets taken\nout, is gone -- the other components are still there to rise up and\nstill manage and control, because each of these components have a\npicture of the whole.\n\n\n\nThey\nhave all the technology and everything they need to continue to\ncontrol and dominate and brainwash. we are over our heads here,\nbut we are not alone.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwhat happened was they took over. It was very easy to take over the\ngovernments: You dangle technology, you dangle knowledge, you dangle\nancient history, and you give them this technology in\nsecret. You\nhave it. we are going to give it to you.\nThe United States of America made this mistake.\n\n\nSo,\nBob Dean, again; Mr. Dean made a reference yesterday to the missing\ntrillions of dollars from the Federal Reserve. I have been told it\u2019s\n$24 trillion dollars, is what they carry on their books, and\nvirtually most of that has gone into the secret space program and the\ncolonization of our Solar System.\n\n\n\nYou\ncan choose to believe that or not. It does not matter and it\ndoes not change the reality of it.\n\n\n\nSo,\nwhat happened was, the pirates took over the ship. The governments,\nrealizing that they had all this technology and that they were a\nthousand years more advanced than we were, instead of telling\neveryone: Hey, we have a\nproblem here, and\nstanding tall and doing the right thing, they joined the pirates.\n\n\n\nWe\nare literally only now, as passengers on the ship, finding out and\nrealizing that we have been hijacked. That\u2019s the movement.\nAnd many people are going to have a very difficult time when they\nrealize that reality is not at all what they think it is or what they\nthought it was. Even those of us who have been exposed to this for\nmany, many years have \u201cOh\nshit!\u201d moments.\n It\u2019s impossible not to, you know?\n\n\n\nYes,\nour politicians sold out. It was easy to corrupt them.  We\nhave an enormous mess. they are stuck in the middle as well.\n\n\n\nOver\nthe next year, year and a half, there\u2019re going to be so many\nchanges.\n\nAmerica\nis the focal point here of this and the reason for that is because\nAmericans, despite our educational system, are still very smart. We\nare very able to think out of the box. We are excellent\nproblem-solvers and we are armed to the teeth. They constantly will\nhave to be looking over their shoulder unless they take us out.\n\n\n\nLadies\nand Gentlemen, that\u2019s the goal. They cannot have a World\nGovernment without taking out the U.S. \u2013 and I mean taking it\nto its knees.\n\n\n\nNow,\nthis is not where the whole presentation is going, but it\u2019s\nimportant to give you this background because the world used to look\nto us for the ideals of freedom. Immigrants all over the world have\ncome to America. My grandparents were immigrants to this country,\nbecause they believed in individual liberties. They believed in\nfreedom. They believed in the principles that were in the\nConstitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of\nRights.\n\n\n\nLadies\nand Gentlemen, that\nis who we are. We are not the crap that they show you on television.\n\n\n\n\nGentlemen,\nyou are not the weak-kneed, sissy morons they try to portray us on\ntelevision, either. You are strong; you are family-oriented; you have\nfaith, and you are warriors. And you are going to need to take a\nstand and defend your country and your family. Make no mistake about\nit.\n\n\n\nThe\ntwo gentlemen that were here talking about the Super Soldiers? Yeah.\nthey are here. they are definitely here. they are\nhybrids. they are here, and there\u2019s more that\u2019s been\ngoing on.\n\n\n\nI\nwas hoping that one of them would talk about what happened in Dulce,\nNew Mexico, but they did not. And I do not necessarily want to\ngo there either because...  ... Oh, God, it\u2019s sick. It\u2019s\nsick. \n\n\nNow\nI... There\u2019s other things to cover, but I bring it up because\nmany people that have the knowledge, that have been in Black Ops,\nSpecial Ops, that have been involved in the ET component, know about\nthat small rogue group \u2013 and they are not gone yet. Some\nof them are still here. All right? And they still create and wreak\nhavoc.\n\n\n\nI\nalso want to tell you \u2013 and I have been asked to share this\nwith you \u2013 about the vaccine, the new swine flu vaccine.\nMorenae\nhas told me to tell you or everyone that this vaccine will\npermanently damage your DNA. So, whatever else comes out of that, it\nwill permanently damage your DNA. \n\n\nNow,\nmany of us in the community and in the world as a whole, we cannot\neven agree on what the problem is and because of that, we will never\neven agree on a solution. So it\u2019s imperative that open dialogue\ncontinue to occur.\n\n\nI\nknow that for those who have been in the Exopolitics \u2013 that\u2019s\nwhat I am basically calling the UFO community, Exopolitics,\nnow \u2013 you have had a remarkable amount of patience. And your\nbiggest tests are coming, because as more and more of this\ninformation comes out, more and more people are going to want to ask\nyou, who they thought were crazy: What\nthe hell\u2019s going on?\n\n\nthey are\ngoing to want to know. And you are going to have to try, in a\nvery calm manner, explain it to them even though you yourselves are\ngoing to have all the butterflies \u2013 you are going to be\nwondering: How the hell am\nI even going to deal with this?\n\u2013 Because you have some background information.\n\n\nNow,\nthis ET component is really about us. It is our destiny to travel the\nstars. It is our destiny to continue to move out and colonize space,\nespecially our own Solar System. It is not our destiny to be killed\nby vaccines and war.\n\n\n\nYou\nwill have to make those choices. My choices are already made. My\ndecisions are clear. I am the father of five children. There is no\nway I am going to back down and I am going to sell them\ninto slavery. Never going to happen!  Okay? You need to\nmake your own choices.\n\n\nOkay.\nI once asked Vissaeus,\none of the Andromedans who has since crossed over, what was to become\nof us. (Some of this may be a review for some of you.) What was to\nbecome of us? What was going to happen to our race, to our\ncivilization?\n\n\n\nHe\njust looked at me and he said: This\nis how we see you: Responsible, freedom of self-determination,\nbecoming truly self-confident and free, to unconditionally be\nresponsible for oneself without being coerced\nto accept some higher authority.\n\n\nIn\nour Galaxy,  the more advanced the civilizations have become in\nthe center of the Galaxy, the riffraff had to start moving out to the\noutskirts of the galaxy. The riffraff \u2013 just like Star\nWars, okay? We are in the\nboonies and that\u2019s why we have some riffraff here. we are\nnot the only planetary race that is having problems with the\nriffraff.\n\n\n\nBut\nwhat\u2019s unique about us is that, genetically, we are considered\n-- to the Andromedan race \u2013  genetic royalty.\n\n\n\nI\nhave been saying this since day one: We\nare extremely unique and\nit\u2019s because of that uniqueness, we have enormous strength. We\nhave enormous capacity for emotions. We have enormous intent and\ndrive to not only survive, but to create. What we lack is faith in\nourselves.\n\n\nAt\nthe end of World War II... Well, let me put it another way: The Nazis\ndid not lose the war. Okay? Germany lost the war, but the Nazis\nwere brought here and to Russia.\n\n\n\nNow,\nthe mind technology, the mind control, the space technology, the\nreverse engineering, the technology that they had been given prior to\nthe war by a small group of extraterrestrials from the star system of\nAldebaran,\nwas brought here and honed and polished and combined with other\ntechnology that the Zeta\nTwos , the Dows [Ed note: spelling of \u201cDows\u201d\nis uncertain; googled and found nothing.] -- what many\nfolks know as the Grays \u2013 all those began to compliment\neach other; remarkable technology.\n\n\n\nTechnology\nwe absolutely need here. I mean, the combustion engine has been\nobsolete for 70 years. I understand that India also is now going to\nexperiment on wireless electricity. Hell, Tesla did that in 1902 in\nColorado Springs. We know it works. Okay? But those that were funding\nhis experiment asked him: Where\u2019s\nthe meter? And he says:\nWell, there is none. It\u2019s\nfree. They shut it down.\n\n\nThe\nquestion is... well, we will get to that. I am sorry. I am\njumping around here.\n\n\nThe\nreality is, Ladies and Gentlemen, what kind of country do you want to\nlive in? What kind of world do you want to live in? Clearly what\nwe are doing now does not work \u2013 it has run its\ncourse.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave a government that has a lot of problems. We have corruption\nwithin it... not all of it, but we clearly have corruption within it.\nThey have sold out and have been totally compromised. They themselves\ndo not know what to do and their only solution is to turn the\npower of the military and the power of the pharmaceutical companies\nagainst the American people. That\u2019s their solution.\n\n\nThat\nis not okay. That\u2019s not okay!\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\ntime for the UFO, the Exopolitics community, to start creating\nanother Domain of Knowing,\nand that Domain of Knowing is two things: What\ndoes a holographic social structure look like? How can we live with a\nholographic social structure, mirrored after some of the principles\nthat our Founding Fathers laid, but it was not perfect? \n\n\nWhat\ncould we do now? And we are not just talking about the United\nStates. This has to be a global thing; this has to be a global\nmovement. What does that look like?\n\n\n\nSo\nwe need to create and start groups, dialogues, talking about living\nin a holographic structure where all the information that is\navailable \u2013 Black Op, Secret, Top Secret, Above Top Secret \u2013\nis available to everyone.\n\n\n\nWe\ncould just start with the information that we do have; the rest of it\nwill come. It\u2019s going to collapse on itself because it\u2019s\nno good. It cannot stand on its own. The minute we turn our focus\naway from them and they cannot feed off our fear, it will\ncollapse in a heartbeat. Because where focus goes, energy flows.\n\n\nAs\nlong as they keep you looking at it, they are using the energy of\nyour soul, of your spirit, to feed this monstrosity. It\u2019s time\nto just ignore them. Turn your focus away and let us create what\nwe really, really want \u2013 but we have to decide what that is.\n\n\n\nAlong\nwith that, I have been asked to start asking people to talk to people\n\u2013 you are the first to hear this \u2013 about what would\nit look like for you, for Earth, and we will start with the\nExopolitics community. What would it look like for you to be mentored\nby several benevolent extraterrestrial races? What would that look\nlike?\n\n\nWhat\nwould we need to do to establish, not only that communication, but at\nthe same time have us feel safe, with checks and balances, so that\nthey could walk their talk and we have to walk our talk?\n\n\n\nOpen\nmentorship is our destiny. It\u2019s going to happen anyway, but we\ncannot wait for the government to turn itself around. It cannot\nbecause it\u2019s not in control. Right? It is not in control. So,\nwe have to turn our focus away from all that drama and figure out\nanother way.\n\n\nWhat\nI want to do now is read to you what I was given way-back-when\nregarding creating a Domain\nof Knowing. This also\ncame from Vissaeus:\n\nCreate\nanother Domain of Knowing, communicating, and being. In other words,\nthe domain of calling forth or generating your intent needs to be\nmore distinct. \n\nYour\nphysics, as you call it, is a good example of this calling-forth.\nThere have been men on your planet who have called forth new domains\nof thinking that never existed before here. \n\nThey\ninvented it. They did not fantasize it, they did not\npretend. They literally created this new context from what you now\ncall physics. \n\nYour\nhumanity is strong with this kind of example. No being, however,\nmakes the distinction that this is what they are. \n\nI\nwould like to give you an example: your concept of human rights. It\nwas not so long ago that no such thing existed on your planet.\nIt just simply did not exist. You Terrans did not have any\nrights. Only the kings and the priests had their rights, but most of\nyou Terrans do not have any rights. So you and other Terrans created\nhuman rights from nothing. \n\nYou\ncreated the domain that created not only the rights to come forth,\nyou created the language and then you communicated it, and this\ncommunication that you gave had power because it was full of intent.\nIt has the power not only to represent and to invoke, but also to\nliterally bring it into being. \n\nThis\nis what your races need to do in order to clearly know yourselves.\n\n\nNow,\nin talking about that, let us talk about religions for a moment.\nThe pyramidal structure of our governments primarily have come out of\nancient Rome, and Rome was essentially controlled by 13 families.\nThose 13 families still exist today.\n\n\n\nMany\nof the world\u2019s religions, though they have had a tremendous\namount of value and have brought an enormous amount of comfort to\nmany people in our history and in our present day, they focus on\nshame, guilt, sin, and control.\n\n\n\nLadies\nand Gentlemen, that\u2019s the trap. They do not focus on\nself-responsibility. They do not focus on life or respect. They,\nin fact, create more division than we have ever known.\n\n\n\nNow,\ndid they start out that way? With the exception of the Roman Catholic\nChurch \u2013 I am just going to be blunt about it \u2013 no.\nBut the Powers That Be are masters of infiltrating movements. What\nthey do... and I\u2019ll give you the best example I can give you is\nthat of a charitable foundation.\n\n\n\nA\nfoundation is created using the power of the people and the monies,\nthe resources of the people, to do something that is of a benefit to\nhumanity. As it\u2019s moving and it begins to gain power and it\nstarts to spread and shift consciousness, awareness, the Powers That\nBe will walk in and say: Hey,\nwe really believe in what you are doing and we are going to\ngive you a 25-million-dollar grant to help you continue to do your\nwork. But we want to put one of our members on the Board, just to\nmake sure that the money is spent wisely.\n\n\nThen\nthey do it again, and now you have a second Board member. And now you\nhave a third Board member, and before you know it, that movement,\nthat foundation, instead of going up and creating more consciousness,\nmore awareness, is now heading the other way. Now they also control\nthe wealth of that foundation.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave been thinking in a pyramidal structure and a third density\nstructure. they are in fourth density and holographic. We have\nto think the same way and we have to be talking about: How\nis it that we got ourselves into this?\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nessential that we put blame to the side for the moment. There\u2019s\nplenty of that and there will be plenty of that.\n\n\n\nWhat\nwe need is the knowledge. We need to know how these structures work,\nso that we can create something different, something in total\nopposition to it, because I cannot imagine everybody\u2019s\nhappy with the way things are.\n\n\n\nAnd\nthis is not just about the United States. This is about the\nglobal population because the extraterrestrial races do not see\nus as separate countries. They see us as one race, and we are\nall between a rock and a hard place, pretty much \u2013 at the\nmoment.\n\n\nTaking\npersonal responsibility is huge,\nbut it really is the first and the biggest step to achieving full\nconsciousness.\n\n\n\nI am\ngoing to read you a quote that I found. It\u2019s from a gentleman\nnamed Little Hawk. He\u2019s a Native American Indian with the\nMohawk tribe: Take credit\nfor your mistakes, not what you do good -- because you are\nsupposed to be doing good anyway.\n\n\nwe have\nall made mistakes; we have all screwed up, but that\u2019s part\nof the learning process. If you had all knowledge and you were\nall-seeing, you would not need to be here. So collectively and\nindividually, we need to start looking at the world and saying: What\nhas my contribution been?\n\n\nNow,\nI am not talking about going out and trying to save the world.\nIt\u2019s not about that at all. It\u2019s really about each one of\nus individually. It\u2019s about being the Light. It\u2019s about\nnot feeling shame for our mistakes. It\u2019s about absolutely\nlearning that you are not a sinner. That is such crap that I want to\nvomit every time I hear that.\n\n\n\nYou\nare not a sinner!\nYou are a spiritual being in a physical body, or as George Green\nsaid, Rent-a-Wreck.\nI liked that. That was really cute. Okay? \n\n\nNow,\nlook at the structure that is overlaying us: Governments of control\nand dominance; a monetary system that controls everything.\nCorporations and banks that own the debt of every nation, which means\nliterally they are in control, because they have the debt. We\nhave medical and pharmaceutical companies who have had cures for\ncancer and other diseases that now want to damage your DNA with\nuntested vaccinations.\n\n\n\nImagine\nhow afraid they are of you! Can you just for a moment imagine how\nafraid of you they are? And now you have got to ask yourself the\nquestion: Why are they\nafraid of you?\n\n\nBecause\nwe are awesome, awesome Creator-Gods. We have the ability to create\nreality, to bring it forth, to call it forth, and they have done\neverything they can to continue to make sure that we believe we are\npowerless.\n\n\n\nThis\nis why so many extraterrestrial races are coming here now -- because\nthey know different. On some level, Ladies and Gentlemen, we\nconsciously have called forth this drama. This is really about us. We\nhave called this forth.\n\n\n\nThis\nis really about us. It\u2019s not about them. And we need to step\ninto our power here. We need to fully understand it\u2019s time for\nus to step into our power as a planetary race, and not see the\nborders anymore.\n\n\n\nNow,\nI would not be that opposed to a global government if it was set up\nwith a constitution like the U.S. Constitution and an Absolute Bill\nof Rights. But even then, that\u2019s not a guarantee, because if\npeople do not defend those rights, if people do not defend\ntheir liberties, what good is it?\n\n\n\nwe have\njust experienced that. Okay? we have just experienced that. In\n1913, when the Federal Reserve took over, that\u2019s when the train\nstarted going the other way, and here we are a hundred trillion\ndollars in debt \u2013 an absolutely ridiculous number. It\u2019s\nprobably higher. Who knows?\n\n\n\nNow,\nin creating our holographic model of a civilization or a social\nstructure, do we want to have a monetary system? Do we actually need\na monetary system? Because we are the only ones that I am\naware of in our Galaxy that still use a monetary system.\n\n\n\nIn\nfact, many, many years ago I had been asked by Morenae,\nVissaeus to put\ntogether a short presentation on money. They already knew about it,\nbut I did the best that I could.\n\n\n\nWhen\nit was over, Vissaeus just looked at me and he goes: I\ndo not understand.\n\n\nAnd\nI said: What do you do not\nunderstand?\n\n\nHe\nsays: I do not\nunderstand why you have to pay to live on a planet you were born on.\n\n\n\nLadies\nand Gentlemen, that has haunted me ever since. That little bit, just\nthat one little thing, takes you completely out of the box. For the\nfirst time you begin to think: Well\njeez, what would it look like not to have a currency?\nYou know?\n\n\n\nAdvanced\ncivilizations: all their\nneeds are taken care of.\nAll of their standard day-to-day life needs are met by the\ngovernment, no strings attached, and then you donate your time and\nyour expertise and your skills to do something you want that benefits\nthe whole. I am not talking about communism, either. It\u2019s\nsomething bigger than that, but we need some help in defining what\nthat is.\n\n\n\nNow,\nwe have a lot of really brilliant, intelligent people here; here and\nin the world. I know other people around the world have been talking\nabout similar things. Creating a different society, and maybe even a\nholographic society, and what that looks like, a holographic power\nstructure, so no matter what happens, it will totally always stand on\nits own.\n\n\n\nThe\nFounding Fathers tried to do something like this when they created\nall the states as equal, in control, and separate from the\ngovernment. That was pretty much their intent whether they realized\nit or not.\n\n\n\nI\nalso want you to know that we have a lot of help. We are getting a\nlot of help from the spiritual side as well as the dimensional side \u2013\nand I am not talking about just dimensional beings. I am talking\nabout, also, extraterrestrials.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll\ngive you an example of what I am talking about: The vision at\nValley Forge of George Washington. I know that a lot of people on the\nNet... if you have not researched it, I suggest that you do. Some\nsay it\u2019s a hoax. It\u2019s not a hoax.\n\n\n\nI\nalso want you to know that Thomas Jefferson in his dairies, was out\nwalking at his estate in Monticello, was trying to figure out the\nverbiage, the language, in regards to the Declaration of Independence\nwhen he was met by a hooded man, who he never really clearly saw, who\ngave him the conversation and the pieces that he needed to finish the\nDeclaration of Independence.\n\n\n\nI\nalso want you to know that in the Constitutional hall, when everybody\nwas bantering and going back and forth and it looked like no one was\ngoing to sign the Declaration of Independence, up on the top railing\nof the hall a man appeared out of nowhere, and for 20 minutes, gave\nan oration about how important this was \u2013 not only to the\nUnited States and to the moment \u2013 but to the entire world as a\nwhole. As soon as he was done, everybody rushed to the table and\nsigned the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\n\nBenjamin\nFranklin and the Sergeant-at-Arms went upstairs to try to talk to\nthis man because they wanted to know who he was. There were armed\nguards at every single door. The armed guards swore no one went in,\nno one went out.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthere is Divine providence here, Ladies and Gentlemen. It is not a\nmistake that you live in this country. It is not a mistake that you\nare who you are.\n\n\n\nEnough\nis enough! It is time we step into our power, and very simple steps\nwill do this. First you have to make a decision and the decision is:\nNo more bullshit. Okay? No\nmore bullshit! \n\n\nAmerica\nis the reason it is, because we allowed it to happen by our apathy.\nOkay? We have elections. We know we are voting for the lesser of\ntwo evils. We know that, but we do it anyway.\n\n\n\nI\nalso want you to know that the President of the United States is not\nin charge of our government.  He\u2019s just not. I want\nyou to know that there are 47 layers of Top Secret clearances above\nthe President of the United States. Forty-seven layers!\n\n\n\nYou\nwant to know your secret government? That\u2019s your secret\ngovernment. He cannot even get a clearance. He does not\neven know who to talk to, to get a clearance to find out about this\nstuff.\n\n\n\nSo,\nit is important that we turn our focus a little bit and we start\ncreating something different. This is what the founders did. This is\nwhat many people have done throughout the world. The Renaissance was\nsomething exactly like this. They threw off Rome and they tried to do\nsomething different \u2013 Rome, the church, the government of Rome\n-- they threw it off and they tried to create something different,\nand it went for a while.\n\n\n\nMentoring:\nThe conversation in the Exopolitics community, in my personal\nopinion, is no longer Do\nUFOs exist? It\u2019s\ncompletely irrelevant. We already know they do.\n\n\nWhere\ndo they come from? That\nhas some validity. Is it\nmetal? That does not\nhave any validity; it does not matter. What matters is: Why\nare they here? And what can we do to learn from this experience?\n\n\nNow,\nthe reason that many of the extraterrestrial groups \u2013\nbenevolent \u2013 are not talking to the government is because they\nknow they are compromised.\n\n\n\nI\nwill tell you that there has begun some mentoring, off-world, of our\nmilitary. Off-world. It has begun, but that is such a small piece.\nWhat really needs to happen is we need to create a new Domain\nof Knowing and we need to\ncall this information directly to ourselves. No more middle-men. They\ncannot be trusted. We have to do it ourselves.\n\n\nNow,\nhow do we go about that? I do not have all those pieces. The\nidea was to share it and plant the seed inside of all of you to start\nthinking about: What does mentoring look like?\n\n\n\nHow\nwould you imagine extraterrestrials coming down and saying: Okay\nfolks, you have pollution. We can help you with that, but these are\nthe steps you need to do. Here\u2019s the technology that already\nexists on your planet\nto do this, and here is how you need to use it responsibly.\n\n\nAgain,\nself-responsibility.\n\n\nFood,\nthe growing of food; water\u2026 Ladies and Gentlemen, we have the\ntechnology to have all the drinking water we want \u2013 just build\ndesalination plants. We have all the water we need. But they will not\nspend a dime on any of that, because if you do not have water,\nthey have control over you.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave so much technology. We have free energy on the Earth. Tesla did\nit in 1902. We know it exists. Okay?\n\n\n\nA\nhydrogen engine in a car was built in 1955 and did 110 laps at the\nIndianapolis 500 Race Track. The plans were bought by Gulf-Western\nOil and never seen from again. That\u2019s 1955.  There\u2019s\njust so much! There\u2019s so much.\n\n\n\nThe\nLaw of Consistency,\nwhich is what the Andromedans call their holographic civilization, is\nset up like this:\n\n\n\nEvery\nchild, whether they understand the knowledge or not, is given the\nlatest and greatest technology or knowledge, information, data, as it\narrives. It starts at the youngest level. It does not start at\nthe top and stay there and then they decide: Well,\nwe will wait till they are 25 to tell them about it.\n\n\nIt\nis not the same song. We need the children to evolve to advanced\nmaturity a lot faster than they are. Yes, they are growing up\npretty fast, but not to advanced maturity.\n\n\n\nEvery\nsingle piece of information, every single tool that is available, is\navailable to everyone, across the board. The children that graduate\nfrom school in the Andromedan civilization are smarter than their\nparents and no one has a problem with that, because they inherit the\nsociety. they are the ones that continue to go out and expand\nthe society and create the holographic pillars of their society.\n\n\nWe\nare completely going backwards here, and if that is not evident\nto everyone, I do not know what is.\n\n\n\nThe\nLaw of Consistency is that every truth is spoken, everyone is\nforgiven, there is no monetary system. There is an absolutely free\nhealthcare system, but it has nothing to do with pharmaceuticals.\n It has to do with color, light, and sound, which is what\nwe are, even in our physicality: color, light, and sound.\n\n\nIt\nhas to do with the advancement of the soul. We have a damaged DNA\nstructure, so when we reincarnate, we do not always remember things.\nThere are people who do great jobs doing past life regression and\npeople can pull some of those pieces. But to have cognizant memory\nwhen you come back into physicality is something we do not have\npresently. They have that because they do not have a damaged DNA\nstructure.\n\n\n\nCan\nour DNA structures be repaired? According to them, absolutely yes,\nbut we need to make some changes.\n\n\n\nWe\nneed to create the space for us to be free enough to explore those\npossibilities. We cannot do that with the power structure that\u2019s\nin existence today, so we need to create another Domain\nof Knowing, and that\nbegins with yourselves.\n\n\n\nThe\nlove that you withhold is the pain that you carry lifetime after\nlifetime. It all begins with us, each one of us individually.\n\n\n\nNow,\nLadies and Gentlemen, if we work, start thinking, start talking about\na mentoring relationship, what that looks like. How would we want to\nput it together? Even go so far as to say: Okay,\nhere\u2019s where we want to do this. Here\u2019s how we want to do\nit. Who do we want present? Do we televise it to the masses?\n\n\nEverything,\nevery detail. They absolutely will meet us halfway. They are not\ngoing to come in here and save us or rescue us from ourselves.\nthey are not going to do it.\n\n\n\nIf\nany of you are familiar with the Andromedan information, one of the\nthings that was first shared with me when I became an adult was that\nin our Galaxy, tyranny showed up very unexpectedly. And them, and\nother races that are part of the Andromedan Council, have come back\nin time to this moment on our planet and the other star systems that\nare having problems with the pirates, to this time period.\n\n\nThis\nshift in consciousness here is what flips it either way. they are\ngoing to intervene and they have been intervening in very, very\nsubtle ways, because no one wants to live in tyranny, not now or in\nthe future. No one does.\n\n\n\nSo\nthis is our moment. This is our moment as a humanity, as a race, to\nreally decide: Are or are\nwe not going to unite as one?\nAre we or are we not going to watch each others\u2019 back? Are we\nor are we not going to stop taking crap from bureaucracy?\n\n\n\nWe\nhave to make a decision and that decision is upon you, and you are\ngoing to be forced very, very soon to make a decision. And I am,\nyou know, I am not just talking to you folks here in the\naudience. I know that this is being streamed and I know that these\nDVDs and things have a life of their own. I know that better than\nanybody.\n\n\n\nThe\ntime is now and all it does, it starts with you, just to make a\ndecision \u2013 okay? \u2013 to do something, to be radical, to be\na rebel again.\n\n\n\nMost\nof us guys in this audience, we know what that\u2019s like, being a\nrebel. We grew up shooting guns, chewing toast into the shape of a\npistol. Okay? Rescuing the damsel, excited about the next adventure\n-- we know about that, you know? That\u2019s part of who we are. We\nare not domesticated lap dogs. we are just not. And I am\nnot going to be!\n\n\n\nI am\nnot talking about going out and causing crimes. I am talking\nabout defending yourself, your liberties, your rights, your family\nand your community. Because nobody else is going to do it for you. In\nfact, they are all working against us, and even they do not\nrealize what they are doing \u2013 they really do not.\nBecause so much information is compartmentalized, they do not\nrealize the big picture.\n\n\n\nBut\nmany people are waking up very, very quickly, and I know I am\npreaching to the choir in that. But it\u2019s amazing to see how\nmany people are waking up and questioning everything.\n\n\nThis\nis our moment. The next several years is our moment and it really\nneeds to begin now. 2012 is not the end of the world \u2013 is not\ngoing to happen. It\u2019s not our destiny.\n\n\n\nHowever,\nthe Earth will be going through some transitions because we will be\ncrossing the galactic plane and the galactic plane has an intense\nmagnetic gravitational field. There will be changes. It\u2019s\ninevitable. Mr. Green touched on some of that yesterday and others\nhave talked about this as well.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\ngoing to happen, so you need to start thinking about: Where\ndo I really want to be?\nOkay, if it\u2019s here, fine, make the best of it, but create your\nspace of independence. do not take it for granted any longer. We\ncannot.\n\n\n\nThe\nwhole world is looking at us. The Asians, the Europeans -- they cannot\nbelieve how stupid we are.  Gospel! They cannot\nbelieve how stupid we are! they are like: What\u2019s\nwrong with the Americans?\nYou know?\n\n\n\nI\ndo not have an answer. Do you?  You\nwatch TV! .\n\n\nWhat\nI\u2019d like to do, because I do have some extra time, is I would\nreally love to entertain some questions, if that\u2019s all right.\n\n\n\nKC:\n Okay. Thank you, Alex. This is excellent, and I want to address the\nmentoring suggestion because I think it\u2019s actually fascinating.\nI think that this is coming directly from the Andromedans that you have\nbeen in contact with.\n\n\nAC:\n Yes, it is.\n\n\nKC:\n Mentoring is an interesting way of putting it. Okay? If you mentor\nsomebody, you do not rule them. You do not tell\nthem what to do. That\u2019s key.\n\n\n\nNobody\nhere\u2019s even suggested this; I think it\u2019s fascinating. So\nwhat we have here is the notion that you can be in contact with\nbeings that can help teach you. Now, this is going on. This is going\non. I am aware of it. Camelot is aware of it. By God, we\nwould not be here today if it was not for that.\n\n\nThere\nis mentoring going on, but you do have to ask\nfor that to happen, and you have to be as fully conscious in the\nprocess and as responsible and have that ability. You cannot sit\nthere and ask them to do for you. It\u2019s not what it\u2019s\nabout.\n\n\nSo\nI would love it if you would talk about that because you obviously\nhave been mentored, so who better to teach us: What does that look\nlike? How is the interaction with you?\n\n\n\nJust\ndescribe... and I know you have maybe talked to some degree. But in\nyour interactions, if you could discuss some of the ways they have\nmentored you to this point.\n\n\nAC:\n Okay. Know that my mentoring has gone on with times that I have\nliterally been kicking and screaming. The biggest portion of the\nmentoring has really been: Why\ndo I believe things and what it is that I believe?\n\n\nSo\na lot of times the question will come; I will ask a question or I\nwill have a perspective and they will immediately come back and say:\nWell, why do you believe\nthat? What is your process of believing that that\u2019s true? \n\n\nFor\nexample, religions. It was one of the biggest things that I had when\nI was a kid, and it was an issue that my father brought up to me as\nwell when I told him about this.\n\n\nWe\nhave formed perceptions of reality that are not based in reality.\nthey are only based on perception.\n\n\n\nNow,\nin accepting that perception as reality, what we do is we reinforce\nthat illusion. And that\u2019s what we have done on Earth, is we\nhave reinforced the illusion about who we are. About our strengths,\nabout our power, about how we are supposed to live on the Earth.\nAbout being stuck on the Earth, about how we are supposed to raise\nour children. We have all bought into these perceptions.\n\n\nThe\nhardest things were to really look at myself, and this is really\nwhere the work is \u2013 it\u2019s always with yourself. The most\ndifficult work has probably been, for me, in the last five, six,\nseven years.\n\n\n\nQuestions\nlike: Well, who am I?\nThey do not answer it. They do not say: Well,\nyou are this and this and this, but\nwhat they do is they will guide. They have guided me to who it is\nthat I want to be.\n\n\n\nFirst\nwas understanding that you are not just a physicality. That\u2019s\nthe first thing to grasp \u2013 you are not a physicality.\n\n\n\nAnd\njust like some of the speakers said yesterday \u2013 I believe it\nwas Mr. Green who talked about: there is a soul and it\u2019s 22\ngrams. I think they have measured that in body weight. That is really\nwho you are and connecting to who that person really is, what that\nessence is all about, you begin to realize: Oh\nmy God, I am not at all who I thought I was.\n\n\nI am\npurposely being vague because I do not necessarily want to tell\nyou who I am other than to say that who I am here on Earth in this\nlifetime, and the mistakes that I have made, on some level I knew\nbetter not to make those mistakes. Okay? But we do. We do. We\nexperiment. We create.\n\n\n\nAs\nfar as the meaning of life, they would never tell me what that was\nexactly. All they would say is: You\nare creating your own adventure.\nSo again, the responsibility is on me.\n\n\nAs\nfar as mentoring \u2013 to want to talk and to speak \u2013 the\nidea was to just keep it very, very simple. To just share their\nperspectives and let the people do whatever they wanted with it. And\nit does not matter whether anyone believes it or not. People\nknow truth, people know bullshit. Eventually it all comes to the\nsurface; it has to.\n\n\n\nBecause\nall of you are just like me; you all know better, you know what\u2019s\nreal. It\u2019s just a question of detaching ourselves from our\naddiction to physicality. And that\u2019s what it is now \u2013\nit\u2019s become an addiction because the focus is on the\nphysicality. we are not objective anymore.\n\n\n\nAs\na soul, when you have an out-of-body experience and you detach from\nyour physical form, you are completely objective. You have a\n360-degree peripheral view and that\u2019s because you are\nobjective. you are not addicted. you are not stuck in the\nbody or addicted to the body.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s\nthe part that they have been working on with me the most, is to\nactually feel and know that essence of myself as much as possible.\n\n\n\nSo,\nwhen we talk about mentoring, the mentoring is to get us from where\nwe are here to self-empowerment. That\u2019s what I am talking\nabout.\n\n\n\nOnce\nwe have achieved self empowerment \u2013 and it will not take\nlong folks; it really will not take long \u2013 we will know\nexactly what to do, because we are spiritual beings. We are eternal;\nthere is no age to us. And that\u2019s not a metaphysical blind.\nThat is a reality.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthe mentoring is to help us move out of our addiction to physicality\ninto full power as spiritual beings. And it is not full of\ndogma; it is not any of that. It\u2019s all about\nintrospection, voluntary introspection. That\u2019s what it is.\n\n\nKC:\n Thank you. Thank you.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #1 (AM1):  Hi, Mr. Collier. Thanks for being here today. I\nwanted to ask you something about something you mentioned in your\ninterview before. You mentioned that an ancient race called the Paa\nTal created human\nbeings, probably so long ago; I wondered if you could just elaborate\non that, because I always wondered about it ever since you said it.\nThanks.\n\n\n\nAC:\n It is believed that an ancient race \u2013 some of them call them\nThe Founders,\nother cultures call them the Paa\nTal \u2013 created not\nonly the wormholes, but created most of the physicality in what we\nknow as our universe. Because, as they travel, they are finding\ncivilizations and the ruins of civilizations far beyond anything that\neven they know... and we are talking fifth, sixth, seventh,\neighth, ninth, tenth-density space travelers who are traveling not\nonly in, and moving in, our physicality and other physicalities, but\neven their own.\n\n\n\nThe\nwormholes is the best example that I have been given. No one, no\nadvanced space race has any idea how they were actually built, but we\nknow that they exist. In fact, there are several that have snapped,\nconnecting our Galaxy to some of the other nearby Galaxies. they have\nsnapped and no one knows how to fix them because we do not even\nknow how they were built.\n\n\nAM\n#2 (DAN):  I am Dan Bender, the one who\u2019s still working on\nthe streaming. I was asked by the streaming audience, which is now up\nto 1,500 members currently watching \u2013 and I think we have\nprobably have over 10,000 that tuned in on this particular segment.\n Thank you. I have kind of picked three quick\nquestions... hopefully, they are quick, that I was asked to pass\non. they are randomly chosen, so they may not be the best ones\nwe have got out there, but what the heck?\n\n\nOne\nof the first ones was: What\nfree energy devices do you know about?\n\n\nAC:\n One I know is magnetic. Essentially, it was invented by a gentleman\nin Tennessee. It was just a bit larger than a shoebox and it was\ngenerated by magnetics. It had an engine inside of it and it spun.\nOnce you started it, it would power a home completely independent, no\nmatter where it was.\n\n\n\nI\nunderstand that the gentleman and the technology vanished about eight\nyears ago. He tried to get a patent on it and that\u2019s when he\nbasically went off the grid. He actually demonstrated that technology\nand he began building that technology back in 1976.\n\n\n\nDAN:\n The second question I have is: Can\nmentoring happen on the Internet?\n\n\nNow,\nI have to admit, I was not completely paying attention to\neverything because I was so busy with everything on the Internet, but\nthat\u2019s the question I have.\n\n\nAC:\n I do not know. That\u2019s a great question. I do not\nknow. I would not see why not.\n\n\nDAN:\n Okay. I guess we have to figure it out \u2013 one of my little side\njobs I have got to do.  Last question I have here so I\ncan let some of the other folks get back in here: How\ndo you deal with the greed issue?  \n\n\nAC:\n I do not have an answer for that.\n\n\n\nDAN:\n Okay.\n\n\nAC:\n I mean, what is greed? That they\u2019ll never have enough? It\u2019s\nbasically grounded in fear, I would think. Fear of loss, fear of\nabstinence, fear of not having enough, fear of loss. To me that\u2019s\nwhat greed is. It\u2019s just a fear.\n\n\n\nCan\nit become an addiction? Apparently it has.  But I\npersonally do not have an answer for that.\n\n\nDAN:\n Thank you from the Internet audience.\n\n\nAC:\n Okay. Thank you. \n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #3 (AM3):  You mentioned about possible coming changes, like\non a geological level. To me it seems so chancy. I\u2019d appreciate\nmaybe your thoughts on: Do\nwe just trust our intuition as far as where to go, what to do, how to\nplan for something like that, or...?\nIt seems a rather daunting thing to try to get your head around.\n\n\nAC:\n Well, you know, change occurs all the time and you do things\nintuitively all the time as well, whether you realize it or not. You\nmight change the way you go home one day and do something different,\nand then when you get home, you find out that right where you would\nhave been, there was a horrific car crash. That, in fact, just\nhappened to my wife. She did something completely out of the\nordinary, for her, and she would have been right\nthere.\n\n\n\nSo,\nyou know, everybody has their guides; everybody has their own\nintuition. I am not always the most intuitive at times, either.\n\n\n\nThe\nonly way I know to answer this is you just learn to trust yourself.\nIt could be that you\u2019ll be guided to go out of town when\nsomething happens. I do not have that answer. Or you will be\nright where you do not think you need to be, but you are\ngoing to be there for a very, very good reason, and out of it will\ncome a self-empowerment that you never would have had before.\n\n\n\nWe\nall have our own paths and we are all creating our own realities. We\nall have our own personal agendas for learning and growing and\nbecoming who we are. Your experience is going to be very different\nfrom mine. I do not know how, you know, to tell you.\n\n\n\nI\nmean, hey, if I had a hard date? But I never do. I do not get a\nhard date and I have made that mistake in the past about giving\nhard dates, when in fact, they were probabilities.\n\n\n\nSo\nthe fact is, I do not know either, but you just have to trust\nthat you will be exactly where you need to be when you need to be\nthere. And I know that\u2019s kind of a foo-foo, la-di-dah answer,\nbut that\u2019s my own experience as well, you know? That I just\nhave to pray and have faith that I\u2019ll be exactly where I need\nto be.\n\n\nAM3:\n I appreciate that. That\u2019s pretty much my take on it and I just\nwanted to kind of see where your thoughts were on that. Because to\ntry to take it from a mental perspective, and plan, and get out maps\nand... seems a little absurd to me. So I go in the other direction,\ntrusting in the flow of life. So I appreciate that answer. Thank you.\n\n\nAC:\n Exactly. And personally, I wrestle with that all the time. I try to\nhave backup plan to backup plan to backup plan to backup plan, and I\nspend all this energy doing this and it goes in a completely in a\ndifferent direction. So... \n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #4 (AM4):  How\u2019re you doing? Thank you for being here. I\njust have a question. When you mentioned the thing about the 47\nlevels of government...\n\n\nAC:\n Levels of security clearance.\n\n\nAM4:\n Yeah, security, that the President does not even know, that\nhe\u2019s not really in charge. This happened 46 years ago, of\ncourse, but I was just wondering what are your thoughts on the\npurpose of President Kennedy\u2019s assassination? I just was\ncurious about that, you know, just wondering.\n\n\n\nAC:\n  No, no. do not be sorry!\ndo not be sorry. I just... oooh man!\n\n\n\nOkay.\nI will tell you my perspective on that. \nEisenhower told Kennedy about \u201954 [Ed note: That\u2019s when\nEisenhower met with ETs at Muroc AFB \u2013 now Edwards AFB \u2013\nand this was a key meeting of the negative ETs that misled the US\ngovernment, leading it down into the rabbit-hole trap that it now\nfinds itself in, being unable, so far, to proceed forward with the\nET/UFO Disclosure.], so Kennedy knew and he told Bobby, obviously.\n\n\n\nOne\nof the things that happened \u2013 and this has been documented\nthrough the great work that Dr. Steven Greer has done with the\nDisclosure Project \u2013 is that most of the extraterrestrial\nknowledge and technology and exchange of technology went black three\nweeks after Eisenhower knew about it. So he did not\neven know where it was, and this has been confirmed by one of his\nChief of Staff, Brigadier\nGeneral Langdon, I believe it is.\n\n\n\n[Ed\nnote: Sherman\nAdams\nwas Eisenhower\u2019s Chief of Staff; a search of the military\u2019s\nJoint Chiefs of Staff proved fruitless for \u201cBrigadier\nGeneral Langdon.\u201d]\n\n\nSo,\nhe shared all this with John Kennedy and apparently where they felt\nthe hub of the loss of where this technology had gone, and how far it\nwent black, was something called the Special Operations Coordinating\nGroup, which was part of the National Security Council.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2018s\ninteresting to note is that the first thing John Kennedy did when he\ntook office was sign a presidential directive abolishing the Special\nOperations Coordinating Group.\n\n\n\nNow,\nno one knows exactly who they are, but they are not only\nconnected to the intelligence, but also to all the black programs, to\nthe secret space program and everything else. There is some\nconjecture that these people are the governors of the Federal\nReserve, because they control the money, and it\u2019s really all\nabout the money. That\u2019s conjecture though. I do not know\nfor a fact.\n\n\n\nBut,\nwhat\u2019s interesting to note is that they had connections\neverywhere, to everything, because all the intelligence from above\nwould come to them and then they would decide which information the\nPresident was supposed to get. Again, those layers of security\nclearances.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s\ninteresting to note is: after the assassination, the very first thing\nJohnson did when he got back into the White House was recreate the\nSpecial Operations Coordinating Group, now known as Special Group in\nthe National Security Council.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s\nmy take on it.\n\n\n\nAM4:\n That\u2019s awesome. But, that time during The Sixties... of\ncourse, as you know, like four more -- are they all just, like, a\nseries of random events, or all they all different... like, you know,\nKing, and Bobby? Are they just all random occurrences of lone nuts\nlike James Earl Ray and all those guys, and Sirhan Sirhan, or are\nthey just a part of that whole thing?\n\n\n\nAC:\n I think that there are programs that overlap all the actions that\noccur in each country. Yes, there are some lone nuts or individuals\nthat do things, but there\u2019s also, at the same time, an\noverwhelming amount of evidence that many people have been\nbrainwashed and created to be hitters, to \u201cgo wet\u201d and\ntake out people. So, I do not know.\n\n\n\nBut\nagain, you know, let us go back to Operation Paperclip. A lot of\nthe brainwashing and mind control technology that the Germans had\nbeen given was brought over here and they just continued operating\nhere under different names with new passports. So it\u2019s very a\nbig... and I do not know all the components.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\na very big question, but on the surface, does it look like it was\ndone on purpose? I mean, look at the individuals, who they were. They\nwere making change. They were creating an awareness; they were the\nfocal point of a very powerful movement for change, to make things\nhappen for the betterment of everybody. Okay?\n\n\n\nAgain,\nthat is the pyramidal power structure. You lop off the head \u2013\nloss of knowledge; it flounders. Somebody can come in and take\ncontrol and move it the other way, then it does not exist. So...\nokay?\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #5 (AM5):  Hello, Sir. Thank you for being here.\n\n\n\nAC:\n you are welcome.\n\n\nAM5:\n First I wanted to thank you for bringing up a subject that I feel is\none of the most important things that we can talk about here at this\nconference. As far as I can tell, you are the first person to bring\nit up \u2013 it\u2019s the monetary system, the economic system\nthat we predominantly use in this world.\n\n\n\nMy\nquestion is if you and/or the Andromedans have any insight to offer\nas far as the transition that we will need in order to transcend\nan economic system that posits us in a position of feeling like we\nneed to compete with each other in order to survive, making us feel\nseparated from each other instead of being one.\n\n\n\nAC:\n That\u2019s a great question. And let me ask you this back: What\nare your thoughts on it first? \n\n\n\nAM5:\n Obviously, you can tell by how I worded my question...\n\n\nAC:\n Mentoring is about self-empowerment, okay?\n\n\nAM5:\n That\u2019s right.\n\n\nAC:\n What are your ideas on it first? You know, it\u2019s great to ask\nsomebody for their advice when you do not have a clue what you\nwant to do, but that can wrongly, or to your betterment, influence\nyou. But it\u2019s better for you to have some idea about where you\nstand and why you stand on a particular position or a reason to make\na change than to have somebody tell you why.  And that\u2019s\nwhat they want. They want us to come half way.\n\n\nAM5:\n I very much agree with that point, as a matter of fact, and I do\nhave a lot of my own opinions regarding how we can do it. I just felt\nthat it was an important subject to bring back up.\n\n\n\nI\nfeel that personally it goes back to something that you said\nregarding the creation of something that does not already exist\nin the world and never has before. I feel that that\u2019s what we\nneed, in the form of human interaction.\n\n\nAC:\n We can do this. I mean, as souls when we are not here on Earth,\nwe have been in other civilizations that do not have a\nmonetary system. We have this knowledge within us. We do know. We\njust do not have access to it at the moment, but we do know, all\nof us.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #6 (AM6):  Thank you very much for being here. I am very\ninspired by your message.\n\n\n\nAC:\n It\u2019s an honor for me.\n\n\nAM6:\n Thank you, and for us, too. My question to you is, you spoke earlier\nabout the whole thing of the Domain\nof Knowing and, you know,\nthe intention that we have together, and how at one point there was\nnot this whole human rights. So, how can we come together as a group,\ncollectively, in creating an intention for the world that we want to\nsee?\n\n\n\nHow\ncan we... You know, all of us are asking: What\ncan we do? What can we\nall do to collectively share our intentions of the world that we want\nto see, the world that we want to create?\n\n\n\nThey\nhave their intention, but perhaps we need to collectively have ours\nand align together about the world we envision. I am wondering\nif you have any advice or counsel or mentorship about how we can\nunite in that way and gather our intentions to create the world we\nknow to be true in our hearts, we know is possible for us to live in;\nthat we remember.\n\n\nAC:\n That\u2019s the first step. Just talking with your friends, people\nof like mind. Just creating that vortex of knowledge, of harmonic, of\nfrequency, and as you begin to talk more and more about it, your\ngroup grows.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll\ngive you an example, the best example that comes to mind is: in\nColorado there were a group of women who were the wives of soldiers\nover in Iraq.\n\n\n\nWhat\nthey did was, they formed something called the Kitchen\nMilitia \u2013 okay? \u2013\nwhere they would all get together, not only share recipes and about\nrearing children, yadda, yadda, yadda, and sharing information and\nletters about their spouses overseas, but they would also start\ntalking about different ideas.\n\n\n\nSome\nincredible ideas came out of the Kitchen Militia. Several of them\neven started companies of ideas that came out and now they are\nemploying many of the people within\nthe Kitchen Militia.\n\n\n\nSo,\nit\u2019s very simple steps. And again, individually, this has to be\nat grassroots. All it takes is a focus, a turn of our focus away from\nthe drama and the crap that they want us to focus on, on the news and\nCNN, etcetera, and start thinking about: What is it that I want?\n\n\n\nWhat\ninformation do I want to know? What do I want to hear? What\ninformation do I want to hear on the news? What kind of neighborhood\ndo I want to live in? What do I want to talk to my friends about?\nWhat\u2019s really important to me?\n\n\n\nAnd\nLadies and Gentlemen, back in 1993, I was telling everybody to throw\ntheir televisions away. I really was. You know, I told you so, okay?\n\n\n\n\nI\nmean, we have one and we just watch movies and we choose which movies\nwe want. I do have rabbit ears, so that I can watch the election to\nfind out who\u2019s going to screw us for the next four years\n and that\u2019s roughly it. And the Super Bowl, but now I\ncan get that online, so now I do not even have to plug in the\nrabbit ears.\n\n\n\nSo,\nyou know... you guys know this stuff. You know this stuff. You just\nhave to want it, you just have to want it. you have got to want it so\nbad that you are willing to just do it and say: Enough\nis enough!\n\n\nYou\ndo that with your kids. You do that with your neighbors. You do that\nwith your bosses. Now you have got to do it about your life.\n\n\n\nWhat\nis it that you really want? Get some clear, distinct ideas about what\nit is   you really want. Because the system we have now is crumbling\nand it\u2019s going to continue to crumble. All the illusion in the\nworld is not going to keep it standing because it\u2019s run its\ncourse. It\u2019s done.\n\n\n\nSo,\nwe have to create something else. We have to, because if we do not,\nthe Powers That Be will create it for us, and I guarantee\nyou, you will not be free. You will not be free. You will not\nlike it at all.  You will not! It\u2019s a given, an\nabsolute given, because it\u2019s all about them. It\u2019s not\nabout you. And as Spock once said: The\nneeds of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\n\n\nNext\nquestion?\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #7 (DAVE):  Alex, my name is Dave\nFarman. I represent\nALIENSHIFT -- www.alienshift.com\n. The page we made for you is between 200 and 250 pages. It\u2019s\none of the most visited. ALIENSHIFT is about new hope for humanity\nand you are one of the... we could call you the new hope for\nhumanity. I want to thank you for all the stuff you have done.\nBasically my question is... I am sorry. You want to say\nsomething?\n\n\nAC:\n It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s not about me.\n\n\nDAVE:\nIt\u2019s all about us, and the question I have is about us, the\npublic. Every UFOlogist, the past 30 years I have been watching,\nthey write books and videos and they go home. There is no unity;\nthere is no group that can... How can we create such a 40-man\ninternational group that would have a leader like you, for instance,\nor whoever else would want to take the position, and we have our\nvoice with the ET and with the people of the Earth?\n\n\n\n[to\nthe audience] You guys are all waiting for governments. do not\ndo that! do not do that. We are\nthe governments between humanity and the ET. Do not wait for any\ngovernments to help you guys. \n\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #8 (AM8):  Hi. Thanks for coming today. We all appreciate\nthat. I guess a question I have is, I kind of have a profound\nquestion, or somewhat profound, I guess, which is to say that, on the\none hand, I think that we all want to access knowledge and we want to\nknow what\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s empowering.\n\n\n\nOn\nthe other hand, it is also true that the more we know, to a certain\nextent the more of a target we become. I think that that is just\nbecause of the fact... especially the way that we have had a lot\nof laws that have been passed throughout the world to monitor what\npeople are doing. I think we all have to be cognizant of that.\n\n\n\nI am\nasking, what do you think? How can we access...? We know that there\u2019s\npowers that are off-planet. We know that the major self or the Higher\nSelf is one of purity and strength. How do we access that in the face\nof the fact that we do put ourselves \u2013 I do not know if\nit\u2019s at risk\n\u2013 but that we put ourselves in somewhat of a precarious\nposition and that we are facing a very, very organized and very\nstrong union across the planet.\n\n\n\nAnd\nhow do we get there? How do we empower ourselves? I guess that\u2019s\nwhat I want to ask.\n\n\n\nAC:\n Okay. let us deal with the first of these. I want you to do me\na favor just for a moment. I want you to get down on your knees. Give\nhim the mike. Just get down on your knees. Okay? I want you to get\ndown on your knees. Yeah, just like that. Look at me. I want you to\nlook at me. Can you look at me?\n\n\nAM8:\n It\u2019s not what I was expecting, but...\n\n\nAC:\n Do you want to live the rest of your life like that?\n\n\n\nAM8:\n No, not particularly. No.\n\n\nAC:\n Okay, then stand up.  Then stand up!\n\n\n\nDude,\nyou are  eternal soul. All they can do is take this [the\nbody] away from you and you still live. Okay? It\u2019s not who we\nare -- it\u2019s what\nwe are.\n\n\n\nAs\nfar as forming an organization, it needs to be grassroots because\neverything else that becomes a foundation or a corporation, they take\nover. If it\u2019s grassroots and everybody in this audience and\nevery citizen around the world \u2013 if we start watching each\nothers\u2019 back, there is not jack\nthat they can do to us.  There just\nis not.\n\n\nAM8:\n I hear you. I hear you. Okay. That was dramatic. Thanks.\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #9 (AM9):  I got up because I wanted to assert that we are the\nGround Crew and that we are being mentored, and find out if you\ndisagree with that, that this is the choir and that we are being\nmentored already whether we have been tapped on the shoulder by\nsomeone from another part of the Galaxy or not. That we should stop\ndenying that we are already being mentored and we already are\ngetting the message of what it is that we need to do.\n\n\nAC:\n Well, I think George said it best yesterday, Mr. Green: We\nare extraterrestrials.\nYou know?  we are just trying to reconnect to kin,\nbasically. So yeah, you are absolutely right. I do not have\nany problem with that.\n\n\n\nMy\npurpose for reiterating it is knowing that these things go wherever\nthey go and that there are so many people now coming into this,\ndiscovering it for the first time or at least asking questions, and\nit\u2019s important to bring them on board as quickly as possible.\nTo just have them, to plant the seed.\n\n\n\nHey,\non some level you are already being mentored, spiritually, and we\njust need to bring the physicality and connect that to the spiritual\nlessons of ourselves.\n\n\nAM9:\n Thank you. Great.\n\n\nAC:\n That was my purpose.\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER#10 (AM10):  I was just wondering about the nature of the\nincoming object.\n\n\n\nAC:\n What was the question?\n\n\nAM10:\n Sorry, I am a little nervous here.\n\n\nAC:\n Nobody will bite you. \n\n\nAM10:\n Yeah. You mentioned an incoming object, 22 degrees to Uranus or\nsomething.\n\n\nAC:\nEighteen degrees right ascension of Neptune\u2019s orbit. All I know\nis that it\u2019s a planetary structure and it\u2019s friendly. I\ndo not know anything more about it at the moment, but I know\nit\u2019s friendly. Okay? It\u2019s not Nibiru.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #11 (AM11):  I have a question but as I was standing there I\nhad a realization. You were talking about the holographic kind of\nsystem that they have put in place and that you said that we need\nto implement that holographic system. When you said we need to become\ngrassroots, everything has to become grassroots, I got\nit on an extreme level\nthat, by continuing to share passionately with absolutely everyone,\nthat we are creating the holographic system that they cannot\ndestroy.\n\n\nAC:\n That\u2019s right. It\u2019s impossible.\n\n\nAM11:\n I really got it. Thank you.\n\n\nAC:\n you are very welcome.\n\n\nAM11:\n My question is, you were mentioning that the Andromeda have the DNA\nto be able to remember past lives and that our DNA is damaged so we\ncannot. Do you know of ways in which we can heal our DNA? And would\naccessing the blueprint of perfect health and healing in our Higher\nSelf be part of that?\n\n\nAC:\n It\u2019s a great question. I do not have the answer to that.\n\n\nAM11:\n Thank you.\n\n\nAC:\n ...and I had to put my glasses on to see who I was talking to.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #12 (AM12):  Okay, my take on the grassroots thing, and tell\nme if I am right, is that even if we are not out talking,\nif you are doing your spiritual work and in your mind you have a\ndesire for a world that\u2019s peaceful and pure and good without\nthe hatefulness and the fear, and you are creating that, that\nthat\u2019s the\ngrassroots thing; that it\ndoes not have to be an organization.\n\n\nAC:\n That\u2019s exactly right.\n\n\n\nAM12:\n Thank you.\n\n\nAC:\n You got it. \n\n\nNow,\nI wanted to bring up something. I have been blessed to have an\nopportunity to spend some time in Europe, and I was in Switzerland.\nWe had just come out of a pub and there were some young men being\narrested for some reason \u2013 and I will never forget this.\n\n\n\nAs\nwe are standing there watching this happen, one of the young men\nsaid to the Swiss police: You\ndid not read me my rights.\n\n\nAnd\nthe cop stopped and goes: What\nrights?\n\n\nHe\ngoes: I got rights. You\ngot to read me the Miranda Act.\nAnd this was a Swiss student. Okay?\n\n\nAnd\nhe goes: This is\nSwitzerland. You do not have any rights here.\n\n\nOkay?\nBut this young man believed so much in that that he was willing to\nchallenge the police officer about it \u2013 okay? \u2013 and it\nwas a big surprise for him.\n\n\n\nSo,\nyou see, the influence that the United States has had on the world is\nso  more profound than any of us realize and the disappointment\nis probably equal to that at this point \u2013 okay? -- because here\nthe propaganda has been communism, fascism. We have sent young men to\nwar, lost their lives to fight communism and fascism, and in 60\nyears, we become fascist? What\u2019s wrong with this picture?\n\n\n\n[to\naudience] Sir? Two more questions and then I am done.\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #13 (AM13):  I wanted to preface this question with just\nsaying again, as I spoke with you in private; it\u2019s an honor and\na privilege to have you here with us, and thank you for speaking of\nwhat you know. I also wanted to say that I do not want this\nquestion to sound in any way hostile to anyone, because it does come\nfrom the bottom of my heart  and it\u2019s\nsomething that has been bothering me for a long time.\n\n\n\nIf\nwe are to move forward and connect all the pieces of the puzzle, and\nmove forward into the holographic social structure that you are\ntalking about, where the children know more than the adults and where\nall information is given to the young, then why is it that we still \u2013\neven in Disclosure movements and with courageous witness testimony\ncoming forward, people speaking \u2013 that there are still certain\ntopics that people are afraid to or will resist talking about, such\nas the stargates that was mentioned earlier this morning, and other\nthings?\n\n\n\nAC:\n So, is your question, exactly, why there are still some topics\npeople do not want to discuss?\n\n\nAM13:\n Right. In people who are courageously stepping forward and risking\ntheir lives to speak out about what they know, why is it that they do\nnot speak about everything that they do know and there are still\ntopics that they do not wish to speak about?\n\n\nAC:\n Well, that\u2019s a great question and I am also guilty of that.\nIt\u2019s a comfort zone. It\u2019s a comfort level and everything\nhas its own timing.\n\n\n\nWhat\nwould happen to humanity if the government were to come clean about\neverything that they know about everything that they know? Could\nhumanity totally deal with it? Probably a portion of humanity could\ndeal with it.\n\n\n\nThe\nother portion, or portions, or groups, could not maybe deal with it\nat least in the very beginning, because they have constructed a\nreality around themselves that is based on perception that is an\nillusion. To shatter that all in one fell swoop can be a disservice\nto them.\n\n\n\nThe\nidea is to take people and give them the tools that they need so that\nthey voluntarily begin the process of self-responsibility and\nvoluntary introspection. The information is there and it\u2019s been\nout there for 50, 60 years.\n\n\n\nwe will\ntake the UFO community as a whole, Exopolitics. More and more people\nare coming into this. Who is the biggest group now? It\u2019s the\nyoung people, which is promising. They are in fact influencing their\nparents by having discussions at home: What do you think about this,\nwhat do you think about that? So it does not matter how it\nhappens as long as it happens.\n\n\n\nNow,\nI mentioned Dulce in our conversation earlier. There will be people,\nI am sure, who will contact these two\n[Ed. note: referring\nto speakers Duncan O\u2019Finioan and David Corso whose\npresentations preceded this one.]\nto really want to talk about that, and they are going to have to\nbe very careful about how they present the information, because the\nthings that happened there are horrific \u2013 absolutely horrific \u2013\nand they had to be dealt with and they were dealt with.\n\n\n\nHowever,\nthat element that was behind those atrocities still exists here.\nOkay? And even I do not want to talk about that because it\ninvolved women and children. And that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll\ngo.\n\n\n\nBut\nnow that I have mentioned it, I have created a Domain\nof Knowing, okay? I have\njust created a Domain of\nKnowing. Now each of you\nwill start going out, thinking about that, doing some research to\npull that information to you because now you want to know.\n\n\n\nAM13:\n Thank you very much.\n\n\nAC:\n you are welcome. Last two questions.\n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #14 (AM14):  My question was actually about children and the\ndisappearance of children, if you are willing to talk about it.\n\n\nAC:\n  I have said so much about that already. I know that I\nhave been blasted about that. Ladies and Gentlemen, I absolutely know\nwhat I know about the missing children and I am not going to\napologize for it. I stand by what I said all those years ago and I\nstand by it today.\n\n\nKC:\n Okay. Could you summarize? Because we are aware of this as\nwell, so if you could just... in maybe one sentence?\n\n\nAC:\n  ... We have\nbecome a natural resource, very much how we use cows and other\nanimals. We ourselves have become a natural resource. The younger\nones are the most desirable because they are not tainted with\nchemical poisons in their bodies; because they are young. That\u2019s\nall I am going to say.\n\n\n\nKC:\n Laura Knight-Jadczyk\nhas gone into this in depth and Rich Dolan has also written a review\nof her book that\u2019s very positive and Rich has... and Alfred\nWebre published an article about the subject. So, if you want to\ninvestigate it further...\n\n\n\nBecause,\nactually, I just want to augment what Alex is saying here in the\nsense that the point is not to give you everything out on a platter \u2013\nokay? \u2013 for you to understand what\u2019s going on. The point\nis to give you direction.\n\n\nWhat\nAlex is doing here is mentoring you; he\u2019s giving you\nindications. And that\u2019s what our whistleblowers do, by the way.\nThey do not tell you everything. They do not even tell us\neverything. But they give us the clues that we need to do the\nresearch necessary to find out the truth. And when you hit the truth,\nit gets you. You can tell. You know\nit.\n\n\n\nYou\nwant to be in denial, go right ahead. It\u2019s out there. The truth\nis out there. It is unbelievably\nout there! \n\n\nAUDIENCE\nMEMBER #15 (AM15):  Hi, Alex. I am the last question, obviously.\nMy name is Andreas. Please do not take this the wrong way, but I\nlove you, man! \n\n\n\nMy\nactual question is actually directed to the audience and to you. I\nwas wondering if you would not mind conducting a little\nmini-meditation for all of us, to direct our intention to change the\nfuture that we want to have. I was wondering if you would like to do\nthat. Thank you. \n\n\nAC:\n Ooo... I am on the spot!  Well, this\u2019ll be a\nfirst.\n\n\n\nI\nhave an affinity for very simple common-sense spirituality which has\nalways lead me to the Native Americans. So what I will do is, I will\nclose this with a Native American prayer, and that just happens to be\nthe same prayer that\u2019s on the front page here that I have with\nme.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nusually always the prayer that I go to. I change the words and make\nthem my own after all these years, but for the purposes of this, it\nsays exactly what I would want to say.\n\n\nGreat\nSpirit, whose voice I hear in the winds and whose \nbreath\ngives life to all in the world, hear me! \n\nI\nam small and I am weak and I need your strength and your wisdom. \n\nLet\nme walk in beauty and let my eyes ever behold the \nred\nand purple sunsets that you have created with me. \n\nMake\nmy hands respect the things that you have made \nand\nmy ears sharp to hear your words and your voice. \n\nLet\nme learn the lessons that you have hidden under every rock and leaf. \n\nI\nseek strength, not to be greater than my brother, \nbut\nto fight my greatest enemy \u2013 myself. \n\nMake\nme always ready to come to you with clean hands and \nstraight\neyes, so that when my life fades as the fading \nsunset,\nmy spirit can come to you without shame. \n\nAmen.\n \n\n\nLadies\nand Gentlemen, it\u2019s been an absolute honor for me. Thank you so\nmuch.\n\n\n\n[long\napplause; standing ovation]\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nKERRY\nCASSIDY (KC):  David Wilcock is a really stellar individual, as\neveryone here knows, and we thank him very much for being who he is\nand for putting himself in such a dedicated place, to serve humanity\nwith his life. We honor him for that and we stand right at his side.\n\n\nThat\ndoes not mean we agree on everything, or how it will roll out, or this\nor that, but in the main we agree. All right? And we are very happy to\npresent him here today. David Wilcock.\n\n\n\n\n\nDAVID\nWILCOCK (DW):  Thank you. Thank you, Kerry. All right, we do have a\nlot of material to cover; we do not have a lot of time. How many\npeople here need a bathroom break, or are you ready to just keep\ngoing?\n\n\nAUDIENCE:\n Go, go.\n\n\nDW:\n Just go? All right. Now, you video guys, do you need me to wear a\nLavalier mic for the video recording? Or, you are okay? All right.\n\n\nThe other\nthing is, if you guys are doing this live streaming, can you cut back\nand forth between my slides and my face as it's going out live? Can\nyou do that? Okay. Because there is going to be a lot of slides and\nthey will go fairly quickly.\n\n\nOkay,\nnow we have gotten the business taken care of, let us get down to the\nreal work, which is this subject of 2012.\n\n\n\nWhat I\nwill be proposing tonight is definitely not your typical approach to\n2012.\n\n\n\nIt\nis very important to understand on an intrinsic level that what we\nare dealing with is not channeling, it is not Mayan prophecy, it is\nnot ancient religious teaching, it is not speculation and it is not\npsychic.\n\n\nIt\ndoes not require anything except the exacting measurements of the\nscientific process and the insight to be able to take information\nthat has already been put out there by NASA, by mainstream scientists\nstudying the mysteries of what it means to be a biological life form,\nthe mysteries of the Solar System, the mysteries of energy and\nmatter, and how does matter and energy truly function.\n\n\nWhen you\nstart looking at the hidden mysteries of science, which are already\nout there now, you find out that the human species is undergoing a\nmassive evolutionary process right now. And I am going to prove that\nto you.\n\n\n\nI am\ngoing to prove to you that the nature of this evolutionary process\nfundamentally rewrites DNA and biological life to such an extreme\nthat within one generation \u2013 I will show you the proof in this\npresentation \u2013 that a creature can give birth to something that\nbecomes an entirely different species than the creature whose womb it\ncame out of...\n\n\n\n...and\nthat there is nothing more that needs to be done to create that\nenergetic change but to simply zap the embryo with a\nlight wave that comes from another\nembryo that has the genetic pattern that you wish to transfer.\n\n\nThe only\nway that this makes any sense is to begin seeing DNA as susceptible\nto quantum wave effects.\n\n\nYou\nmay have seen, most of you have probably seen 2012\nEnigma, which is a video of mine\nthat I am proud to say was number one most viewed on Google, December\n1st of last year.\n\n\nThe\nreason why it got that way is because the information has rocked the\nInternet. It has led to my getting the starring position on a Syfy\ndocumentary coming out in November, on Syfy Network.\n\n\n\nIt's led\nto Penguin contacting me to write a book based on the video, one of\nthe biggest publishing companies out there.\n\n\nIt\nhas led to my working with -- I am going to say this now publicly --\nJim Hart, who wrote the movie Contact\nwith Jodie Foster. That is our screenwriter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank\nyou. I am working on Wanderer\nAwakening, which is the album cover\nyou see here in the slide, with the nine-time Grammy-winning\nmusician, Larry Seyer.\n\n\nThe\nreason why all this big talent and why all this attention is being\nfocused here is not because I may have been somebody else in another\nlifetime. It's not because I have done psychic readings. It's not\nbecause I put prophecies on the Internet that later were shown to\ncome true.\n\n\nThe\nbiggest thing that I bring to the planet right now is to simply look\nat ancient prophecies that we know to exist, that we can document in\ngreat detail, and to then give a scientific framework for these\nprophecies on such an advanced level that we are looking at things in\nan entirely different way.\n\n\nSo,\nlet us get back to 2012 Enigma\nfor a minute. Most of you have seen that video. You may remember that\nI discuss an experiment that was conducted in which a tiny, what's\ncalled a buckyball, was shot through a grating. The grating is 100\nnanometers wide. The buckyball itself is only about one or two\nnanometers wide. It goes through the grating and it turns into a\nwave.\n\n\nThe\nbuckyball itself, which is supposed to be a macroscopic object, goes\nthrough this little slit, and for whatever reason, it turns into a\nnon-local wave.\n\n\nNow\nwhat does quantum non-locality\nreally mean? It means that you do not know where the wave is in space.\nYou also do not know where the wave is in time.\n\n\nQuantum\nnon-locality shows that the more you try to find out where it is in\ntime, the less you can find it in space; the more you try to find out\nwhere it is in space, the less you can find it in time.\n\n\nIf\nyou look at the quantum physics equations, it's well known in quantum\nmechanics that the time has to be both backwards / forwards \u2013\nit has to be completely non-linear in the traditional sense.\n\n\nAlbert\nEinstein has given us the Theory of Relativity. The Theory of\nRelativity is going to tell you that when you travel through space;\nit's not empty space. What did Einstein call space? He did not call it\nspace, he called it space-time.\n\n\nThe\nreason why he called it space-time is that he said you are moving\nthrough something that makes time start running faster as you go\nthrough space. So you could literally be inside a spaceship, leave\nthe Earth for two weeks flying at the speed of light, come back, and\nit's 500 years later.\n\n\nWe\nknow that this has been proven. It actually was done on jumbo jets\nflying at the highest altitude they could, where they had little\nwatches on them, or little radioactive time-keeping devices, and they\nfound very subtle, but definite changes in the speed of time, just\nbased on the velocity of a jet going around Earth orbit.\n\n\nSo,\nimagine what happens when you go up towards light speed. Now, this is\na proven principle in physics: As you move through space, you are also\nmoving through the so-called time fabric, the space-time fabric, as\nEinstein called it.\n\n\nThere\nwas a mistake that Einstein made in his scientific understanding of\nspace-time. It may be a mistake, or it may be that he figured it out\nand he did not want to talk about what he discovered.\n\n\n\nIn\nthe Einstein Relativity Theory, it is assumed that the only direction\nyou can move is into the future \u2013 if it's space-time, the time\ndimension is only one dimensional.\n\n\n\nBut,\nwe actually now know from the physics of Dewey Larson, which you'll\nalso see on my 2012 video, that the whole way that the quantum world\nis being built is that there is a domain in which time as we think of\nit is three dimensional, and space as we think of it is one\ndimensional.\n\n\nThat\nworld is constantly interchanging energy back and forth with\nspace-time. We call it time-space\nover there. It is space-time\nover here.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthis time-space realm over there is sending energy into space-time\nand it's pinging back and forth \u2013 and that is what creates\nmatter.\n\n\nThe\nreason why this is important is that if you can get over into\ntime-space, then you can actually travel a physical distance and\nreturn to space-time, and you have now time-traveled... and it is not\njust the future. You can actually travel into the past.\n\n\nIf\nyou are traveling in the direction that the Earth is rotating, and you\ntravel ahead of where the Earth was rotating when you left, you are\ngoing to end up in the future, because you now re-emerge in\nspace-time ahead of where the Earth was on its timeline when you\nleft.\n\n\nIf\nyou travel west, that's into the past. East is the future, west is\nthe past. And again, it's going to sound ridiculous and for those who\nare uneducated, they'll blast me on the Internet and say that I am\nfull of it.\n\n\nBut,\nthe fact of the matter is, this is very much provable stuff. I have had\npeople write me and say that the science in 2012\nEnigma is ridiculous.\n\n\n\nWell,\ngo to www.reciprocalsystem.com.\nRead Dewey Larson's books because there are several of them, and find\nout for yourself how he breaks down every single problem in quantum\nmechanics and shows you have got to have three-dimensional time.\n\n\nSo\nall we are saying is, if you can get over into time-space,\nit's going to look like everything does here, because every atom and\nmolecule around me right now is here because it is exchanging with\ntime-space. So there is time-space stuff in every place around me.\n\n\nThat\nmeans all this stuff exists as a parallel structure in a parallel\nuniverse, and when you go over there, it becomes your three\ndimensions of space. It's going to look the same because the energy\nof it is the same energy that is here in space-time.\n\n\nNow,\nhere is where it gets really confusing, if it's not already\nconfusing. \n\n\nSee, in my\nmind, I do not have to worry about this stuff. It comes in very\nnaturally.\n\n\nYou\nactually have an energetic pair\nto your physical body which is in time-space, okay? But, there are\nall these bonuses that your energy body has in time-space that your\nphysical body does not have here.\n\n\nWhat I am\nliterally telling you is that every nook and cranny, every little\nfunny fold of your brain exists as a parallel energetic structure\nthat is coupled with the cells in your brain, that interfaces with\nthe cells in your brain, that interfaces with every molecule of DNA\nin your body.\n\n\nThat is\nwhere ALL thought processes are actually occurring. they are not\noccurring in your nervous system at all in terms of intellect.\n\n\nThe body\ndoes produce certain forms of thought. You have an autonomic nervous\nsystem. You have a cerebellum that keeps you from falling over, makes\nsure that you are balanced by working with the fluid in the chamber of\nyour ear, the cochlea.\n\n\nYou have\nall of the basic systems that are going to make sure that your heart\nis beating, that your lungs are breathing, that your eyes are not\ntaking in all the information peripherally so that you can focus on\nwhat you are looking at.\n\n\nYou\nhave a screening mechanism that is going to screen out background\nnoise so that, if there is television on and somebody is talking to\nyou, you are going to listen to them talking and not hear the\ntelevision. you are not going to hear all the input and weigh it the\nsame.\n\n\nThose\ntypes of things are biologically-driven systems. The body makes those\nthoughts for you.\n\n\nAll\nof the actual intellect, all of the actual thinking that you are going\nto be doing in your mind is not in the body at all. You have a\nparallel body, a parallel brain, a parallel nervous system that is an\nenergetic nervous system.\n\n\n\nBut,\nit does not look like your physical body because your physical body\ndoes not have billions and billions of strings coming out of it. It\ndoes not have an instantaneous energetic connection that you can\nvisibly see to everything else in its environment.\n\n\nWhat\nI am asking you to visualize as strings is actually simply an energy\nfield. In time-space, you are part of that energy field and your mind\nis not simply that which is created within your own energy field. It\nvery much is affected by all these other things that are around you,\nincluding the thoughts of other people.\n\n\nThe\nvery fascinating case of Norman Mailer, the famous novelist who wrote\na novel called Barbary Shore...\nin this novel, he starts out writing about one main character and\ngradually changes the novel to write about a Russian spy. The Russian\nspy becomes the focus of the entire novel. He goes into great detail.\n\n\nWithin\nthe same week that he finishes Barbary\nShore, a Russian spy was arrested in\nhis same building that he was living in \u2013 just up the stairs\nand down the hallway.\n\n\nNow, does\nthis mean there was a conduit that was going through the air vent so\nthat he could hear what this guy was saying? Of course not.\n\n\nWhat\nit does mean, though, is that that man was so emotionally charged\nbecause he was at the end of his rope and he knew he was going to get\ncaught, that his mind was sending out signals. And Norman Mailer's\nmind is an energetic phenomenon which is sensitive to its\nenvironment, and picked up the signals that were being generated.\n\n\nNow,\nagain, I talked about the experiment where buckyballs are shot\nthrough a hundred-nanometer grate, a little tiny slit. They turn into\na wave just by hitting the grate. It's like it makes them like flip\ninside out and go from space-time, where they are a particle, into\ntime-space.\n\n\nThat\nsolid particle, which has 120 atoms in it... it's not just like some\ntiny little thing. It's a ball, it's got structure, it's got form,\nit's got shape. It literally popped out of our space-time entirely.\n\n\n\nIt\nflipped over into a realm where time is three dimensional, space is\none dimensional, and it smears out \u2013 it's partly in the past,\nit's partly in the present, it's partly in the future. In that state\nit looks like a wave, because you cannot measure where everything is\nanymore.\n\n\n\nSo,\nnow get a load of this. The DNA molecule is only slightly wider than\na buckyball. Which means the DNA molecule is also subject to quantum\neffects in which the molecules within your DNA are phasing between\nbeing here in space-time and being in time-space, where they actually\nare stretched out through linear time; and they are sensitive to all\nthe other energy fields around them.\n\n\nNow\nagain, this is science. All we are doing is we are starting with\nEinstein's Relativity. we are saying that as you move through space,\nyou move through time. The faster you move through space, the faster\nyou are traveling through time.\n\n\nIn\ntime-space you can move not just in the future, but into the past as\nwell, depending on what direction you are traveling.\n\n\nThe\nRussians have identified the \u201ctime field\u201d, which means\nthat if you speed up the time field in a small area, time will run\nfaster or slower in that area compared to everything else around it.\nthey have got lots of experiments with little wrist watches and stuff\nwhere they put them in the time field and the time field makes it\nspeed up or slow down.\n\n\nNow,\npyramids are one of those things that will make those watches change\nspeed, so a pyramid is an actual symbol of something that will cause\nchange to occur.\n\n\nThe\npyramid is a symbol, but it's also a technology \u2013 it's also a\nmachine.\n\n\n\nThe symbol\nof the pyramid is that which is reaching up. It's something that's\nreaching for the heavens. It represents geometry and there is\ngeometry that makes this energy field of the time field I am talking\nabout function. It's all based on geometry, which is more complex\nthan what we are going to do in this presentation.\n\n\nThe\ntime field is something which not only affects the passage of linear\ntime; it also affects the health of your body. The more of this time\nfield that's flowing through your body, the healthier you are going to\nbe, and paradoxically, the slower you are going to age.\n\n\nIt's when\nthe flow of the time field stops that you move out of eternity, that\nyou move out of timelessness. It's when time stops flowing through\nyou that you stop being an eternal being and you begin aging.\n\n\nRemember\nthat scientific study that Deepak Chopra talked about in Ageless\nBody, Timeless Mind where he gets a\nbunch of elderly people and he puts them in a room where it has the\nmagazines of 40 years ago. It has the radio broadcasts, it has all\nthe furniture, everything.\n\n\nWhat\nhe found was that within a very short period of time, all these\npeople had a remarkable turn-around where they started to reverse\naging. They actually started getting younger in a way that is\nmolecularly, biologically provable. That's because the time field\nstarted flowing again. They started to have hope.\n\n\nThe time\nfield is that which gives you inspiration. If you want to know\nwhether the time field is really flowing through you or not, you can\ntell because you will be in a state of uplifting gratitude and\npositive emotion.\n\n\nIt\nis a scientific fact that the more that your mind goes into that\nstate of resonance, of positive attitude, of fearlessness, of\ncourage, you are causing time to flow through you faster, which means\nyou have the power of eternity at your fingertips, which means you\nare at the forefront of the human evolutionary process.\n\n\nBut,\nthis is not something that only relies upon your ingenuity and your\ndedication to a spiritual path. It is something that is being done\nfor you by forces that are very mysterious, because they are much\ngreater than what you would normally think of as your conscious mind.\n\n\nYou\nwant to talk about the monolith in 2001\nand how mysterious that was? That's not even the beginning of what\nwe are talking about now.\n\n\nThis\nbig stone slab shows up and all of a sudden, all those cavemen learn\nhow to use tools, and they can kill each other now, and they become\nthe dominant species.\n\n\n\nThen,\nat the point where the movie goes into the present, the monolith\nshows up on the Moon. Commander David Bowman, at the end of the\nmovie, ends up becoming the new Adam, the new species of humanity,\nafter he goes through a stargate.\n\n\nThere's\na lot of things that are known on the inside and this stuff is not a\nsecret. It is not a secret. Even though it has been kept secret, it\nhas been attempted to be kept secret, it is not secret.\n\n\nAll\nof the information we need is already here so that we can\ndefinitively understand that what is happening to the Earth is a\nnaturally-occurring process. It is a sacred process motivated by\nforces of intelligence that would stagger the imagination.\n\n\nBack\nin the old days, you had a LAN system in which a computer was just a\nmonitor and a typewriter. You plugged it up to one central computer\nand everybody's little dummy terminal, as it was called, was plugged\ninto that one computer.\n\n\nOn some\nlevel, each of us is the dummy terminal. We appear to be separate, we\nappear to be an identity that has an ego, that has a body, and we\nidentify with the body.\n\n\nOn some\ngrander level, the body is merely a projection. It's like if you have\na prism and light is going through the prism, and as it rotates you\nsee these rainbows around the room.\n\n\nEach one\nof you is one of those rainbows but would you say each of those\nrainbows are each an individual generator of light? No. The light is\ngenerated by whatever is striking the prism. Those individual pieces\nof rainbow light are just the reflections of the one light that\nstrikes the prism.\n\n\nIf\nyou want to really get into the esoteric science and understand what\nthe ancient prophecies are telling us and why it is so relevant to\nwhat you are going to hear in this talk, try to vibe into the fact\nthat the entire manifest universe, that matter and energy itself, are\nbut reflections of this one singular light. That all visibility in\nthe universe, everything we can measure, is a reflection into what we\nthink is space and what we think is time.\n\n\nBut when\nyou start really understanding what time is, you realize you can go\nwhatever direction you want - forwards, backwards and sideways.\n\n\n\nWhen you\nunderstand space, you realize that space does not pose any obstacle if\nyou can pop through to time-space, back and forth from space-time to\ntime-space.\n\n\nYou can\nwormhole yourself, or portal yourself, or whatever they want to call\nit, from any point in the universe to any other, instantaneously.\nThat is how it's done, because there is no actual location.\n\n\nLocation\nis an illusion which is based on the rules of the road, so that we\nhave one Intelligent Super-Being that has wanted to experience\nmultiplicity; It has wanted to experience separation, so that It can\nreunify.\n\n\nIn\nterms of how that functions in our Galaxy, the Galaxy is generating\nintelligent waves, which you are going to see the proof for in this\npresentation, and those waves upgrade the speed of this time field or\nof what I call \u201cthe source field\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe speed\nof vibration of the source field is going up.\n\n\nIf\nthat speed represents how well you think, it's no different than you\nupgrading your computer and going from this ridiculously bad\nprocessor, where you could barely even get any of your websites to\nload because it takes so long, and getting this really fast machine\nwhere now every page, POOF! \n\n\nSorry\nabout that.  She almost jumped right out of her seat. I'll\ntry to do that a little more delicately next time.\n\n\nOkay.\nSo, you broke me out of my trance now. Now, I have got to actually talk\nfrom the ego:  How is it going, man?\n What the hell was I talking about?\n\n\n[back\nto himself] All right, let us see, we have got to the get the download\nback in play here.\n\n\nWhen\nwe understand that this energy field is part of the Galaxy, that the\nGalaxy is a conscious being, the Galaxy has energy that must be\nconscious. The energy that is in the entire universe must be\nconscious and it must create life.\n\n\nLife\nis the Divine imprimatur\nof all energy in the universe. All energy in the universe is built to\ncreate life.\n\n\nThe\nphysicists call this the \"Goldilocks Principle\" and they\ndo not even have a clue as to how far the Goldilocks Principle goes \u2013\nit's not too hot, it's not too cold, it's just right.\n\n\n\nThat's\nwhat they are talking about in terms of planets like ours and how we\nhave just the right amount of oxygen, just the right amount of water,\njust the right temperature, all these things are perfect.\n\n\nIt's not\nan accident. Life on Earth is not some random little thing that only\nhappens once in the history of the cosmos. Life on Earth is actually\nprogrammed to be here.\n\n\nWe\nhave to get rid of this idea that... Well, we do not have\nto. I try not to use must\nand have to,\nbecause those are very strong words.\n\n\nIt\nwould be beneficial to learn that there are forces out there much\ngreater than the human intellect, much greater than the ego, much\ngreater than the body.\n\n\n\nThere\nare forms of consciousness that could be an entire planet, that could\nbe the Sun, that could be the Galaxy, which is really nothing more\nthan a bunch of suns and planets in a big cluster.\n\n\nWell, we\ncan prove that that's going on. So I am going to start showing you\nsome things here.\n\n\nThe\nfirst criticism that anyone will have when you go into a 2012\ndiscussion is they say, Well, nothing\nis really that different. Everything's the same.\n\n\n[slide:\nIs This Just Another \u201cOrdinary\u201d Time in History?]\n\nwe are\npretty much doing the same thing now that we have always been doing. We\nget a little bit of progress here, a little bit of progress there,\nbut nothing is going on right now. There's nothing unique or special\nabout this time in history.\n\n\nI beg to\ndiffer.\n\n\nThis is a\npicture that you are going to see from the fires in Australia.\n\n\n[slide:\npicture of a Koala Bear drinking water from a small water bottle held\nby a fireman, with one paw in the hand of the fireman]\n\n\nYou\nmay not think of this, but Koalas in the wild are actually quite\ndangerous. They'll claw you and scratch you; they'll attack viciously\nto protect their home.\n\n\nBut\nwhen it comes to these Earth changes, this Koala was more than\nwilling to accept nourishment and love from a human. A wild Koala.\nHe's not scratching, he's not attacking.\n\n\nNow this\nis the thing that people do not seem to understand. The universe is\nbuilt to deliver the experiences that are already happening.\n\n\n\nThe\nuniverse is not a cosmic comforter that hands you a lollipop when you\ndo not love yourself and says, Oh, I am\njust going to just send you all these people who are going to love\nyou because you do not love yourself;\nand, Oh, I am sorry you do not love\nyourself. Let me send you loving people.\n\n\nIs that how it works? What happens to you when do not love yourself?\nWhat does the universe send to you? Does it send you a lollipop?\n\nHey,\nlook at that. That person does not love himself, that person does not\nhave a high opinion of himself. I have a puppet now, I can manipulate\nthat puppet. I can make that person do what I want because they are\ntoo afraid to go against me. They want to be polite. They have such a\nlow self esteem that if I tell them something that I want them to do,\nthey are not going to want to upset me.\n\n\nSo,\nwhat the universe actually does is, that if you have a weakness, if\nyou have something you do not like, the universe says, Oh,\nyou do not like that. Well, here, have some more. Have some more.\n\n\nUntil\nyou get to the point that you simply accept experience, and accept\nyourself. And when you learn to accept yourself, you will not be\nmanipulated because you will decide that it's better to preserve your\nsovereignty than be manipulated by someone else.\n\n\nYou will\ndecide that your state of mind, being positive and uplifting, is a\nbetter state for you to be in than the state you are going to have to\ngo through temporarily to really piss somebody off when they are\ntrying to manipulate you.\n\n\n\nBecause\nthey are going to take it personally, they are going to get angry;\nthey are going to throw hate at you. That's what they do. That's what\nthese types of people do.\n\n\nNow,\nwe are not judging those people, except insofar as that they are in\nconfusion. They are living in a confusion that makes them think that\nthe body is who they are and they are trying to do things to comfort\nthe body, at your expense.\n\n\nThis\nis the meme that's going on, on the entire planet. That's what a lot\nof these talks that you have been hearing are about. We are talking\nabout how much corruption and greed and rottenness has festered into\nthe society and the structure of civilization on Earth.\n\n\n\nIn\nthe governments, in the militaries and the corporations, in the\nschool systems, in the financial systems -- throughout everything\nthere is this corruption, this molding that has occurred.\n\n\nlet us get\nout of the idea that this is a victim consciousness that we are going\nthrough. That's what I'd recommend.\n\n\nYou\ndo what you want, but this is how I have decided to live: I am\nnot going to be anybody's victim. I am not going to be anybody's\nslave. \n\n\nI claim\nand I ask you with me right now, by your applause, to claim your\nfreedom and your sovereignty in this moment. let us have a hand for\nthat.\n\n\n[applause/\nhoots/ whistles] All right!\n\n\nIf\nyou can claim your freedom of positivity, your freedom from fear,\nthat is the most threatening thing to the negative controllers in\nthis world, because this is a frequency war.\n\n\n\nThe\none thing they do not want you to have is a positive, loving feeling\nin your day-to-day lives; if they can keep you thinking that you are\nat the brink of destruction, that nuclear missiles are ready to\nincinerate the Earth, that the economy is ready to collapse, that\nyour government is ready to herd you off into concentration camps.\n\n\n\nthey have\nwhipped up this fever to such an extent that people are bringing\narmed weapons to gatherings where the President is because now Fox\nNews wants you to think that Obama is the same old thing.\n\n\nI\ndo not care if that is what you believe or not, but any time that Fox\nNews is telling me something is true, I am inclined to think it's not\ntrue, based on their past history. Can I get an \"Amen\" on\nthat?\n\n\n[applause/\nhoots]\n\n\n\nIt's\na little bit disturbing when you start watching Bill O'Reilly and\nGlenn Beck and they are saying exactly the same things as all your\nfavorite conspiracy websites. That's not good, that's not what we\nwant, because Fox is a corporate entity. It is a propaganda organ.\n\n\nIt's also\nimportant to understand that many of the conspiracy sites have been\nseeded with propaganda. These are not independent bloggers that are\nactually trying to raise money and do an honest living. These are\npeople that are funded by the Pentagon and the NSA. we have had\nextensive discussions with people about this, who are insiders.\n\n\nSo\nwhat's happening now is that because, as a planet, we have not loved\nourselves \u2013 we have been stuck in this self-loathing and this\nself-condemnation and this fear of our own potential, this fear of\nour power \u2013 the universe has not sent us these majestic,\nloving, cosmic leaders who are all-knowing and all-powerful and can\nbe trusted with the warmth and innocence of a young child.\n\n\n\nThey\nhave sent us vicious killers who will do nothing but spare no expense\nto rape us, to steal every cent of our money. That's what happens in\nthe universe, but it only happens until you do not need the lesson.\n\n\nIf you\nlearn to love yourself, do those negative people still get fixated\ninto your life to such an extent that that's all you ever have? No.\n\n\nIf\nyou are one of these people who has been through self-loathing and\nmoved into a positive self-concept and self-esteem, if you have\nlearned the power of \"No\", as opposed to the power of\n\u201cNow\u201d, and you can say \"No\" to somebody trying\nto manipulate you, then all of sudden, you are not shackled to this\nfeeling of obligation to someone who is being grotesquely unfair.\n\n\nYou\nnow have the wherewithal to speak your mind, to say your piece, to\nget your needs met, even if it means that it's going to upset\nsomeone. Because if someone has denied you the respect and the\nsovereignty and love that you deserve as a perfect child of God, then\nyou deserve to protect yourself from that person.\n\n\nYou\ndeserve to love yourself enough that you claim your right to exist.\n\n\nThe\nuniverse sees that you have learned your lesson. Now, the people that\nwould have taken away your freedom, and would have taken away your\nsovereignty, can no longer do so, because even one flicker of light\nin the darkness is enough to show you the layout of the room.\n\n\nwe have had\nenough of that now, that there is a massive awakening going on.\n\n\nProject\nCamelot \u2013 and I was a part of this \u2013 happened to get\ninvolved in the center of this swine flu vaccination conspiracy. We\nhad a situation unfold onstage in Z\u00fcrich between myself and\nanother witness who was arguing in favor of vaccinations and is\nactually a former operative for Majestic, which is the UFO working\ngroup arm of the neoconservative Republican New World Order faction\nof the world elite.\n\n\n\nSo,\nhe's telling you: You should get the\nvaccine. Now, granted, there is a\ngreat deal of science to suggest that vaccines do confer immunity. We\nare not disagreeing with that.\n\n\nBut\nwe are also considering the testimony of people like Jane\nBurgermeister, a well-known mainstream journalist who happened to go\nalternative when she started to find out that Baxter Pharmaceuticals,\nas you all know, had released a vaccine and -- thank God -- these\npeople in Norway injected it into some rats\nbefore they gave it to people, and the rats\nall got bird flu and died.\n\nOops!\nHow did that happen? [giggles for\neffect] I do not know how that\nhappened. Did we do that? No, of course not.\n\n\nSo\nlook, you also have people in the government who are not high enough\nto know that this swine flu thing might have been manufactured and\nthey have a very legitimate concern about the swine flu.\n\n\n\nIt's\nbeing kept secret, but they do believe that this could mutate like it\ndid in 1918, which, you get sick the first time it's not that bad,\nbut when you get sick the second time and everybody is dying --\nmillions of people are dying. That's the theory.\n\n\nlet us\nbear in mind that in 1918 the world was nowhere near as civilized as\nit is now. Sanitation was much less. In order for you to have any of\nthese flu, regardless of what they\nare... get your health down in a negative way, your immune system has\nto be depleted.\n\n\nWhat's the\nbiggest thing in this new science I am going to teach you about that\ndepletes your immune system? NEGATIVE THOUGHTS!\n\n\nSo,\nif they can keep you in fear, which means that you hate the\ngovernment, you hate the President, you hate what's happening to your\nkids in school, you hate the economy, you hate the Federal Reserve.\nIf you are angry and you are fearful all the time, and then they stick\nout a little virus, guess what happens to you? You get the virus.\n\n\nA\nvirus is a frequency-based entity. As you see in my 2012\nEnigma video, polio, rubella, all\nthese various viruses have geometric structure, which is wave\nparticle structure. Geometry can flip around into the time field and\nbecome a wave.\n\n\nBudakovski,\nwhich you are going to see in this presentation, proved that the wave\nstructure of a disease is enough to infect healthy tissue in a\nhermetically sealed container. You can take the wave structure of a\ndisease, zap it through a hermetically sealed container, and have\nthose cells inside the container catch the disease.\n\n\nA\ndisease is a disease of the mind which has, as its medium of\ntransference, the consciousness field. That's how you get sick. It's\nby going out of integrity. The nutritional component is secondary to\nthat.\n\n\nWhen\nyou are in an area where everybody is depressed because their living\nconditions are very difficult, they are going to get sick a lot more,\nbecause they are so negative.\n\n\nSo,\nI ask you this, if you can respect yourself enough to no longer let\nthese people into your life on a personal level, is there a Hundredth\nMonkey effect that happens to the planet? Of course. Of course!\nThat's what's happening right now.\n\n\nWhat I\nsaid on this panel last night, what I said on the radio show that I\njust did with Project Camelot on Thursday, what I am preparing to say\non my website, is that we are now at a point where we have graduated.\n\n\nI was told\nthis a year ago. I was actually starting to be told this two years\nago. It's now happened.\n\n\nWe have\ngraduated from the need to have the New World Order running the show.\nIt's over. It's going to be over within less than a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not\ntrying to be psychic. I am talking in facts. I am talking about the\nsimple fact that you cannot lie to people who know the truth.\n\n\nWhat does\na lie require to exist? It requires an absence of information. It\nrequires you not knowing that it's a lie. Because if you are being\nlied to and you know that it's a lie, then it's not a lie.\n\n\nIt becomes\nan obvious, ridiculous gaff that this person is making. It becomes a\nsituation that can be remedied because you can start laughing when\nthat person tells you a lie. Because you know the truth.\n\n\nWe\nare watching the derivatives system, the Ponzi scheme and\ninternational bankers being ripped apart because the other countries\nare tired of playing the game. They now have more economic power than\nthe old European white men that run the New World Order and the\nIlluminati \u2013 they no longer have the leverage to be able to do\nwhat they are doing.\n\n\nWhat I\npropose to you on an even more intrinsic level is that this is all\nsomething that appears to be happening as a result of natural\nprogressions of events.\n\n\n\nBut\non another level, it is an energetic phenomenon which is being\nprogrammed to occur by a movement into a higher energetic frequency.\nThat frequency is making us more present with ourselves.\n\n\n\nThe best\nthing you can do for the planet, the best thing you can do to save\nthe children, to avoid the swine flu, to protect yourself and your\nfinances, and to make a better world for future generations, is to\nstay in that state of positive, uplifting peace and gratitude. Can I\nget an \"Amen\" on that?\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nAnd I\ndo not profess that I am the guy you go to for the answers. You can\nsend me your emails. I am happy to read them. I read all my emails.\n\n\nBut\nthis is something that each of us are doing. I have only identified an\neffect that is happening to everyone. If you want to go religious for\na minute, the Second Coming of the Christ, or the Messianic return,\nis something that is happening to everyone.\n\n\nI\nwas talking to Jordan  over dinner with Bill and Kerry the\nother night, and he was telling me that if you really go back into\nthe original Old Testament documentation, that the Messianic figure\nis not one person. It represents this change into a whole new way of\nbeing.\n\n\nSo,\nnow he's got me convinced that I have got to go looking for that data\nmyself. He has reason to believe it's true, and I am sure he's right,\nbut I need to find my own facts. I do not wait for somebody else to\ncome and teach me something. If I hear something that I like, I go\nlook and I find out for myself.\n\n\nI\nwas told from my own guidance, which is dreams and visions and\nprophetic information, that there was going to be a great change\nhappening to the Earth and the Solar System. I did not just nod my\nhead like a subservient slave to some Higher Power and say, Yes,\nyou are right, you are right, oh lovely master. I will do what you say.\n\n\nI\nsaid, No, I cannot believe that.\n\n\nI\ncannot believe that the whole world is going to change on an energetic\nlevel that will make what we are in now seem like the most miserable\ndepression, by comparison. That the life that we have now will become\n100 times more harmonious. In which things like instantaneous\ntelepathy, levitation, telekinesis, healing and flying are so\neffortless that it's as easy to do as raising and lowering the\ndiaphragm to make your lungs breathe. It requires no extra effort.\n\n\nThat\nseems to be what's going on. There's all these people that we have in\nEarth's history from a variety of cultures - including Jesus. And if\nyou do not want to believe in Jesus really existing, there's plenty of\nother cultures you can go to look for so-called Ascended Masters...\nthey are out there; guys that have these abilities, guys that do these\namazing things.\n\n\nAll\nthat represents is somebody who is a little bit farther ahead than\nyou are... not too much.\n\n\nWe know\nthat the ETs that are visiting us are almost entirely human. The\nwidest divergence from a human look that you are ever going to get is\nthe so-called Gray.\n\n\nThe\nmajority of humans - and we are getting more and more whistleblowers\ncoming forward and telling us the same thing: the ETs are our family.\nThey look like us, they have similar types of voices that we do,\nalthough they may not use them anymore because telepathy works much\nbetter and much faster.\n\n\nThis\n\nis like a dial-up modem. It sucks, okay? \nIf I could telepathically speak to you... PFFT. Sorry. [blows\ngently into mic] Foo -- how's that?\n\n\nIf\nI could telepathically speak to you and just give you the download,\nBOOM, you'd just get the whole thing and I can walk off. Thank\nyou very much, good night! And I am\ndone.\n\n\nIt's\nalready happening is not it? I am giving you holographic plates.\n\n\nWhat\ndo we know about a holographic plate? You cut it up into little\npieces; you shine lasers into each one of those pieces and what\nhappens? Do you see one side of the hologram? You see the whole\nhologram! Just maybe just a little bit dimmer.\n\n\nSo what\nI am doing is I am giving you all these little pieces which seem to be\nvery interdisciplinary. I am talking about diet, I am talking about\nhealth, I am talking about politics, I am talking about science.\n\n\nBut I am\ntalking about the same thing. I am talking about you.\n\n\nWhat\nis your identity?  What\u2026 Is\u2026 Your\u2026 Identity?\n\n\n\nIs\nit your body? No. Is it this room around you right now? That's part\nof it. Your body is part of it. The people sitting next to you in\nthis auditorium, or if you are watching this on the Internet, the\ncomputer screen that you are looking at -- that's part of you.\n\n\nThe\nchair that's touching your bottom is part of you, it's your identity.\nWhen you walk on the ground, the ground and the Earth is also walking\nagainst you, not just you walking against the ground.\n\n\nWhen you\ngo outside and you see the blue skies, and you see the clouds, and\nyou see the birds, and you see the trees, and you hear the wind\nblowing through the trees, that's you. That's who you are.\n\n\nEnergetically\nwe can prove that. Energetically we can prove that all the cells in\nyour body change every seven years. Who you are right now, this body\nthat you have, even if you have this big nasty wart on your face or\nsomething, that wart has been completely re-done over seven years of\ntime.\n\n\nOkay,\nfine. What does that mean? That means that the energy that made you\nchange every seven years flowed through you, but it did not get stuck\nthere. It kept on going.\n\n\nIs\nit not true that the air that you are breathing right now as I talk to\nyou has potentially been shared by every person in human history?\nThat's pretty nasty if you are a germophobe\nperson, is not it? \n\n\nEvery\nperson in the world's history has breathed the air that you are\nbreathing. It's going around and around and around and around. It may\nbe getting cleaned, but all the energy is there and you can trace it\nback. That can be scientifically proven, easily.\n\n\nSo\nwhat about you? Who are you? Who are you, really? If the energy field\nthat makes your consciousness is interpenetrated with other peoples'\nconsciousness, and we can prove that, then who are you?\n\n\nAre you\njust this ego? Are you just this part of yourself that feels like\nyou are lacking something?\n\n\nBecause\nthe body needs things to survive. The body needs sanitation. If you\ndo not shower it for a while, it's going to start smelling pretty\nnasty. If you do not go to the bathroom, you are going to get sick and\nyou'll eventually die.\n\n\nIf\nyou do not eat something, you are going to starve to death. If you\ndo not drink something, you are going to dehydrate to death.\n\n\nThe\nbody is fragile. It can be cut; it can be having broken bones. You\ncan have hair loss, skin problems.\n\n\n\nEverything\ncan go wrong with the body, and therefore, when the body feels pain,\nyou feel pain and it seems like your identity is now in jeopardy\nbecause the body is so identified with the identity, we assume our\nidentity is the body. But we now have the scientific proof that\nthat's not true.\n\n\nSo\nyour identity ultimately is the Earth \u2013 The\nGaia Hypothesis, James Lovelock.\n\n\nYour\nidentity ultimately is the Sun \u2013 that which created all the\nparticles and molecules that make you who you are now.\n\n\n\nYour\nidentity is the Galaxy. Your identity is the Universe. The energy\nthat makes the Universal Mind is you \u2013 it's just in a slower,\nholographically fragmented form, like that prism I said is rotating\nand all these little rainbows are there. That's all it is, that's all\nyou are.\n\n\nBut,\nthat is everything you need to be because that proves that you are\nthe light, you are the love, you are the One Infinite Creator.\n\n\n\nThat's\nall you ever have been, that's all you ever will be, and that's more\nthan enough, because what that means is that you have limitless\npotential.\n\n\nThere is\nnothing special about me. The only thing that is different is that\nI am very dedicated to doing what I am doing, and I am getting in touch\nwith that part of myself that has access to the higher consciousness,\nand it makes me more and more an embodiment of who I am.\n\n\nThe\nmore that you get in touch with the Higher Self, with your true\ncosmic identity, the more that you become one of the Living Master\nGeniuses on this planet.\n\n\n\nIf\nyou had any idea of the scope of what you COULD be if you truly\naccess your potential, it would floor you because every single one of\nus has the potential to be a Messianic figure, to be the savior of\nthe world.\n\n\n\nWe all\nhave that potential and we are all doing it to varying degrees as we\nstart awakening.\n\n\n\nWell, thank you.\n\n\nLook, I\ncould yak about this all day but we have got a lot of slides to do, so\nlet us do some slides.\n\n\n[slide\nreads: \u201cInterplanetary Climate Change: NASA's Hottest Secret\u201d]\n\n\nThe\nGalaxy is pumping out these waves of energy, which are now changing\nthe Solar System, and we are going to talk about that in very concrete\nterms. you are going to see all the proof for that.\n\n\nThe\nfossil record is undergoing 26-million-year cycles as well as\n62-million-year cycles, as you see in this graph here. What's causing\nthat to happen? All life on Earth spontaneously changing in even\nintervals of time?\n\nOh,\nit's got to be some big rock out there that's spinning around.\n\n\n62\nmillion years is not some big rock. That's like a third of the orbit\nof the entire Galaxy, basically. It's about a fourth because the\nGalaxy is about a 240-million-year orbit. 62 is about, roughly\nspeaking, it's a quarter. It might be exactly a quarter... that might\nbe the point.\n\n\nWhat did\nthe Ancients know, and why must we remember now? What do pyramids\nreally do? Pyramids are harnessing the source field. we are going to\nget into that in a minute.\n\n\nWe know,\nand we can prove now, that Atlantean civilization was nothing new.\nThese pyramids around the world are not something that was built in\nconventional history. It was built before then.\n\n\nOff\nthe western tip of Cuba, as you see in this map here, at this c\nGuanahacabibes - I cannot even pronounce\nthat - the Guanahacabibes Peninsula, right off the tip of that on the\nwestern tip of Cuba; you go a mile down. Well, so it's not quite a\nmile, but it's a long ways down under the surface of the ocean and\ndown there you find a submerged city, as this link says on BBC News.\n\n\nThis\nis the only officially-released side scan sonar photograph of what\nwas actually seen down there. Does that look like random pieces of\nsand on the sea floor? No!\n\n\nThis\nis what it actually looks like if you reconstruct it in a computer.\nThat's a computer graphic rendering of what you just saw right here.\nIs everybody with me? That's not something that just showed up as a\nresult of random geologic processes. That's a human-built structure.\n\n\nThis area\ncould not have been above the ground, and above sea level, prior to\n11,000 years ago.\n\n\nPaulina\nZelitsky is here in a cave in Cuba,\nwhich used to be the Atlantean highlands, looking at inscriptions on\nthe cave wall. they are precisely the same as inscriptions that they\nsaw being painted on the walls of these submerged cities that they\nsent submersible submarines probes into.\n\n\nWhat\nyou are seeing here is a diagram of the energy fields in the Solar\nSystem which are, of course, concentric rings emanating out from the\ncenter of the Sun.\n\n\nThey also\nsaw these cross formations painted on inscriptions in these submerged\ncities.\n\n\nNow\nhere is the only other photograph that she's ever released. This is a\nstill-frame from a much longer film where she is flying a submersible\nthrough this city.\n\n\nWhat do\nyou see in the window of her monitor? Would you like to see it more\nup close?\n\n\nThat's not\njust a little piece of sand on the bottom of the ocean. That is a\npyramid. Would you like to see a pyramid in Egypt that it looks very\nsimilar to?\n\n\nHere\nwe go. This is called the Bent Pyramid of Dahshur, on the right. It's\nalmost identical to what you see on the left, and that is submerged\noff the western tip of Cuba.\n\n\nIt's down\nthere right now. What are we doing by not going and looking at it?\n\n\nWhy\ndid they sell this story to National\nGeographic and it just so happened\nto never make it out in 2003? National\nGeographic did a 360-degree\ncontract. They bought all the rights. It was supposed to be the\nbiggest thing ever to come out in 2003, and guess what happened?\nPfft,\nnothing.\n\n\nWell,\nwhat we have now is evidence that somebody out there who is\nresponsible for building this seal into the dollar, knew that these\npyramids harnessed some sort of energy field, because what you are\nseeing is clearly an energetic, non-physical structure going down on\nto the top of the pyramid here.\n\n\n[slide\nreads: Do Ancient Sites Harness 'Energy'?]\n\n\nThis\ngrants the next question. I talked about the time field, I talked\nabout the Russians. Is there a technology in which you can build\nsomething that will take this natural energy that makes physical\nmatter that is flowing through everything and harness that energy in\na given direction? The answer is \u201cYes\u201d.\n\n\nyou are\ngoing to have some fun now. you are going to get to look at some\nthings that are already well known to exist and I am going to let you\njust think about them.\n\n\nThe\nfirst is menhirs,\nwhich are standing stones. I want you to bear in mind that the height\nof a human being is only a little bit taller than where the top of\nwhere the shadow is in this photograph. These are enormous, enormous\nstones.\n\n\nDo you\nthink that maybe these enormously tall stones were built for a\nreason? Do you think that maybe these ancient peoples were putting\nthem there because they got something out of it? Is it merely a\nreligious symbol, or was it put there because it had a technological\nusefulness?\n\n\nDo they\nput these headstones over your grave because it's just decorative? Or\nare they hoping that the headstone is going to have some sort of\nenergetic effect that will keep your body preserved and usher you on\ninto the afterlife?\n\n\nCan\nthese stones actually create ripples of energy that will raise our\nfrequency of consciousness, that will make us feel better, that will\nmake us healthier, that will make everything around us more\nharmonious?\n\n\nIf you\nthink about the possibility that these stones could be put in the\nposition and change the way that your mind works, then you are\nthinking in the right direction.\n\n\n\nthey are\nenormous, and it would be a lot of work to do that just for some\nreligious symbolism. It would be much more apropos\nto believe that people would go to all this trouble if they could use\nit for something.\n\n\nThe\nnext thing we are going to look at is dolmens.\nThese are stone cellars.\n\n\n\nWhat\nif you were able to build a little stone cellar, a little stone\nstructure, get inside of it and have it harness energy so that while\nyou are sitting in there, you meditate and it raises your vibration?\n\n\nIt\nraises the consciousness frequency of your mind while you are inside\nand all you have to do is sit under this absolutely colossal stone\nthat if it fell, would crush you flat instantaneously. \nVery precariously.\n\n\n\nThis\nis Kilclooney in Ireland. Look at that thing! Look at how that\ngigantic stone that weighs more than two 18-wheelers, at least, if\nnot much more. If that little guy were to just fall off of the tips\nof the other stones, he would crush you flat. And yet, there he is,\nand with all the earthquakes and with all the Earth changes that have\ngone on, it is still balanced precariously, right up there.\n\n\nHere's\nanother one balanced precariously. Why would they go to so much\ntrouble? Do you really think a bunch of guys are just going to do\nthis because it's cool? Do you really think they would go to the\ntrouble of getting themselves crushed in trying to precariously\nbalance these very, very massive stones just because it's a fun thing\nto do? I do not think so.\n\n\nIn this\ncase you see that actually part of the stone has broken off and\nfallen onto the ground. But the point is the same. The point is, look\nat what's going on there. You go underneath, you meditate and you get\ncharged up.\n\n\nNow this\nis an example of a more advanced structure where a wall is built\naround you. Once you go inside that wall, you now have a much, much\nhigher energetic charge; and you have got a little breathing hole.\n\n\nThis is\nanother one from the side.\n\n\n[someone\nin the audience asks for the location of the photos]\n\n\nAh, you,\nwould not you like to know? No, actually I did this in a rush and I\ndo not know where all these locations are, but it's easy to find\nonline. Just look for dolmens and you'll start to find them.\n\n\nGo to\nGoogle pictures, Google images. Google dolmen, the word dolmen,\nD-O-L-M-E-N, you'll start finding these things.\n\nBarrows\nis the next thing. Barrows are mounds. The idea here is that you\nactually drill a hole into the ground, underneath the mound. There is\na round chamber inside the mound - this is well known - you go in\nthere and you have a little party and you meditate. It's enough now\nthat you can bring in a group of people.\n\n\nIt\ndoes the same thing as a dolmen except you are burrowing into the\nEarth now. So, here's some barrows. And this one, of course, you see\nhow well-structured it is; Silbury Hill being the biggest one.\n\n\nNow,\nhere, the entrance is... of course, the English government has been\nkind enough to put iron bars in front of it so you cannot go in there.\nThey do not want you to be able to use this technology anymore, and\nthey are probably worried about finding condoms and stuff inside,\nfrankly.  But that's not what it's built for, necessarily.\nMaybe it was.\n\n\nSome\nof these barrows are longer, and you also have the Mound Builders in\nthe US. You have all these other things like Serpent Mound in Ohio\nthat you can go to and see this in the US; I am only doing the English\nones right now.\n\nHenges\nis the one that everybody is so familiar with and everybody loves.\nBecause now you get standing stones like the single ones you were\nseeing before except now there are certain areas where the energetics\nare so high that long rows of stones are being put together because\nit's going to be even more powerful.\n\n\nThe sheep\nreally like being near these stones. In fact, animal life really can\nfeel this more than we can.\n\n\nThese were\nnot put there by accident. And again, in this case, you have a\ncombination of a barrow and a henge. You have the henge at the front,\nhere, and if you go through that path down the middle, you go into\nthe barrow, and you go inside and you meditate.\n\n\nMaybe the\nhenge in the front helps focus the energy that's flowing through the\ncenter of the barrow.\n\n\nHere's\nanother henge, out there just hanging out in the middle of the\nEnglish countryside. Some of them are in France; some of them are in\nGermany. they are in Ireland, too. they are all over the place. Here's\nanother one.\n\n\nHere's\nanother one, here's another example.\n\n\nOne of the\nmost impressive, which unfortunately has been lost to the ravages of\ntime to a large degree, is Avebury. Now, what you are going to see\nhere, if you look closely, is that all of these different stones, all\nof these different little dots that you see as you go along here,\nrepresent individual stones.\n\n\nThis\nlooks like a giant serpent. Here's the head, and here's what it's\neaten, in its stomach... if you look up at the top in the middle\nthere, there's two little rings of stones inside. That represents the\nmeal and then here's the tail down at the bottom.\n\n\nDown\nhere is one of the barrows. This is Silbury Hill, the best barrow of\nall, the most famous one and the most well-structured one.\n\n\nLook at\nthe geometry. Look at how it's a perfect equilateral triangle between\nthe head of the snake, the tail of the snake, Silbury in the middle,\nand then here's the area up here.\n\n\nNow\nwhat this was for, this was a gigantic technology. This is a machine.\nIt's a machine built, based on... As you look around it, the contours\nof the mountains, the contours of the land, so that a bunch of people\nget inside this area right here and they have a big party and they\nall meditate and chant and run around and do fun stuff, and they are\nchanging consciousness for themselves and for the planet.\n\n\nThat's\nwhat this stuff was built for. It's a consciousness technology. Of\ncourse, Stonehenge being the greatest example of all; these Sarsen\nStones as they are called are gigantic in size and very beautiful to\nlook at.\n\n\n\nWhat\nyou may not realize is that, at one time, there was a whole ring of\nthem, like this. That's what it used to look like.\n\n\n\nAll\nthe stones that have fallen have been identified in the soil, because\nthe more they fall down over time, the more that it rains each year,\nthey fall further and further into the ground. But they have all been\nfound. So this is known to be true, I am not making this up.\n\n\nWhat\nwe know is that Stonehenge was used to identify Solstices, and when\nthe Moon and the Sun were traveling, and what would happen, because\nduring certain planetary alignments, certain times of the year, these\nzones on the Earth became much more energetically active.\n\n\nAre\nthese ancient structures connected? The answer is \u201cYes\u201d,\nthrough the science of Ley Lines. This was done by Sir Alfred Watkins\nand we are going to talk a little bit about him.\n\n\nHe\nfound in the 1920s that ancient holy sites lined up in straight\nlines, which he called leys.\nSites from extremely different ages, millennia apart, were all\naligned with one another. This includes the Neolithic Age (which is\nthe Stone Age), the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and the Christian era.\n\n\nNow, he\nwould use this camera to basically be able to look across long\ndistances and see if things were in a straight line. What you see\nhere is the summary of the massive amount of research that he did.\nWhat you see here is, every single one of these words is a different\nancient sacred site.\n\n\nNobody\never comes out in the open and says, Oh,\nby the way, all these sacred sites are built in a straight line.\nIt took a guy like Alfred Watkins to analyze this and discover it for\nhimself.\n\n\nBut\nguess what a lot of these things are? they are cathedrals. Do you\nthink that maybe the Knight Templars knew that there was something\ngoing on? Hm. Do you think that maybe they knew to build on that line\nand not to build off the line?\n\n\n\nDo you\nthink that maybe if you build a church which acts as a funnel for\nthis consciousness energy, that if you build that domed roof for the\nchurch out of stone, over that line, that it is going to harness more\nof this energy field from the universe and that, in so doing, it's\ngoing to become a resonator so that when you go to church you are\ngoing to be experiencing a revelation, a higher consciousness?\n\n\nDo you\nthink that maybe the stained glass window and the Gregorian chant\nmusic are creating harmonics that help you harmonize with the field?\nAbsolutely.\n\n\nSo, here's\nsome people from his Stonehenge club, the Straight Track Club as it\nwas called, the Ley Line hunters.\n\n\n\nHere is a\nbarrow that had trees growing around it.\n\n\n\nHere\nis a similar ring of trees without a barrow. This is a natural Earth\neffect caused by these energy fields, because they do have circular\nformations. Well, it is a hyperdimensional effect. These are\nharnessing hyperdimensional energy, because the hyperdimensional\nenergy is what makes the matter that is building the stones.\n\n\n\nLet\nme say that again. The matter that makes these stones, the stone\nitself, the actual hard stuff, is built from hyperdimensional energy;\nenergy from the time field that's flowing into our space-time.\n\n\n\nThat's\nwhat, according to Dr. Dewey Larson, all matter is built from is this\nhyperdimensional exchange between three-dimensional time and\nthree-dimensional space. That's all it is.\n\n\nSo\nof course you are going to get time anomalies. But it's also the\nenergy that builds you. It builds your DNA. It builds your body, so\nwhen you get more of it flowing through you, you are going to have\nmore health and vitality.\n\n\n\nBecause\nit's the energy of your consciousness, because it IS consciousness,\nit is also going to give you a more advanced intellect.\n\n\nSo,\nthe way that we can actually prove that this global grid, these\nenergy lines, has a hyperdimensional effect that can completely pull\nyou out of our three-space of length, width, and height -- the\nthree-dimensional world -- is with the research of Ivan Sanderson.\n\n\nHe\ninvestigated a massive number of different disappearances of ships\nand airplanes. What he did is, he took everything from the dawn of\naviation, going all the way back to the first airplanes, and even\nbefore that for the marine records. He looked for every case of\ndisappearance since planes were discovered.\n\n\nHe\nfound that the majority of what he was finding all clustered around\ntwelve points on the Earth's surface. That's completely\nunprecedented. That is not mainstream information. It was done in the\n1960s.\n\n\nThis guy\nshould have been treated with as much respect as somebody like Edison\nor Einstein, or Alexander Graham Bell or the Wright brothers, because\nthis is a huge discovery. Twelve key points around the world in which\nplanes and ships are spontaneously disappearing.\n\n\nHe\ndid not have anything in mind when he started doing this. All he did\nis he looked up each one and he gave it a push-pin, push-pin,\npush-pin. And where were all the push-pins at the end? They were in\ntwelve places.\n\n\nEven\nstranger is that the twelve places are not just haphazardly scattered\naround the Earth \u2013 they are all equally distant from each other.\nthey are harmonically balanced with one another. they are all the same\ndistance apart when you look to the ones that are adjacent to each\nother.\n\n\nIf you\nconnect the dots, you get a sacred geometry, which happens to be the\nsame geometry that's in the polio virus, the same geometry that's in\nmany other viruses at the quantum level, including HIV.\n\n\nBut\nit's not just a negative, toxic thing like viruses; it's a very\npositive thing that's the fundamental building block of physical\nmatter, and biology, and life. It's an icosahedron.\n\n\nNow,\nhere we go. This is the Bermuda Triangle. Obviously you know about\nthis one. Believe me when I tell you that there are many, many\nairplane disappearances that cannot be explained, where they have never\nfound an oil slick or flotsam on the surface of the water. All they\nfind is missing plane.\n\n\nIt's\non the radar one minute and it's gone the next. There is no oil\nslick, there's no wreckage, nothing. And they do not find anything on\nthe surface, on the bottom of the ocean floor, either. It's gone.\n\n\nWhat\nhappened is, it's passing through a portal. It's passing through a\ntime gate \u2013 a gate into another frequency of reality; a\nparallel universe in which time is three dimensional.\n\n\nHere\nare the twelve points that he discovered with his push-pins.\n[referring to slide: Ivan Sanderson's\nVile Vortices - showing a world map\nwith triangles in a pattern] Take a close look.\n\n\nYou\nsee the Bermuda Triangle off the coast of Florida. You see another\none near Brazil in South America. You see another one here, on the\nland in Africa. Another one down here by Sri Lanka. You see one\nthat's the Himalayan mountains... all that crazy stuff like the\nMaster and Teachings of the far East [Life\nand Teaching of the Masters of the Far East],\nTibet, all that stuff up there.\n\n\nyou have\ngot some that are out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean here, which\nis a real lonely area to get stuck in. The Easter Islands is down\nhere. Then you got one here which is the Devil's Triangle. That's\nofficially been declared a disaster area by the Japanese government.\nThey do not allow you to fly or sail through this area.\n\n\nYou\nalso have two bracketing Australia, and that's very important.\nAustralia, if you notice, is the only continent that is completely\npinned between -- actually, four.\n\n\nBecause\nwhat he does not show you on this map is that there's one down here on\nthe South Pole, one up here on the North Pole. So you have got one,\ntwo, three, four... Australia is geometrically perfectly in the\ncenter of four of the most important nodes. So there's a lot of crazy\nstuff.\n\n\nAnd the\nexact geometric center of the nodes happens to be right where Pine\nGap is, which is one of the biggest bases where all this stuff is\nbeing done.\n\n\nYou\nconnect the dots together, you get your icosahedron, which you see\nhere on the left is the geometry. This is what it looks like\nsuperimposed over the Earth's surface, on the right.\n\n\n[next\nslide]\n\n\nNow,\nthis is where it gets even more interesting. These three Russian\nscientists, and everybody laughs when I say their names: Goncharov,\nMorozov, and Makarov [Nicolai Goncharov, Vyachelslav Morozov,\nValery Makarov] See you are not laughing\nbecause I told you it's not cool to laugh, so like, now you do not\nwant to laugh. \n\n\nWhat\nthey did is they went through and they looked at every single line\nthat was discovered by Sir Alfred Watkins; remember the guy that did\nthe Ley Lines? We were just talking about that. How all these\nchurches and all these Neolithic sites and Iron Age sites and Bronze\nAge sites... they are all in straight lines.\n\n\nWell\nthese Russian dudes took every single one of those things that Alfred\nWatkins discovered, and they took every single OTHER structure they\ncould find around the world - the Great Pyramid, Stonehenge, Easter\nIsland, temples and pagodas in Asia, China, Japan.\n\n\n\nThey\nlooked at every single weird, monolithic (which means big stone\nstructure) they could find anywhere in the world and they found that\nevery single one of them fit onto a single grid which was very simple\nto construct.\n\n\nAll\nyou had to do is start with the same twelve points that Ivan\nSanderson found where these matter time-space warps would happen,\ntake those twelve points, connect the dots just like I did... that is\nthe icosahedron.\n\n\nBut then,\nthe icosahedron has a curious property. It is a geometry that,\nbecause it is perfect, can be inverted. It is a mathematical thing\nyou can do where you flip the geometry inside-out, literally. That's\nwhat it would be. If you add the structure, like made out of wires,\nyou could actually flip it inside-out and rebuild it, but build it\nbackwards. Build the geometric inverse of it.\n\n\nAll you have\ngot to do is inverse the icosahedron and make it so that it fits\ntogether with the original icosahedron and you get this grid. Here it\nis.\n\n\nSo,\nI want to point out to you again, because this is a little bit\nconfusing if you do not know what you are looking at, that all of your\noriginal points are still there. Here's the Bermuda Triangle, here's\nthe one on the southern tip, here's the two that I was talking about\naround Australia, the one that's up there, here is the one at the\nSouth Pole. So, they are all still there, but now you have added in the\ngeometric opposite.\n\n\nIf\nyou simply build this geometry, you now have a diagram that shows you\nwhere every single ancient site in the entire world has been\nconstructed on. Over 4,000. They could not find a single one that was\nanything impressive that was not built on this grid. Why do you think\nthat is?\n\n\nIf\nyou have a wire that is going to go to something that powers an\nelectrical appliance, are you going to put the wire under your armpit\nand expect that it's going to work? No. You plug it into the wall.\n\n\nIf you\nbuild a pyramid and you do not build it on this grid, do you think\nthat it's going to work? Not anywhere near as good.\n\n\nyou have\ngot to build it where the energy is. That's why with these cold\nfusion guys, they are looking at the cold fusion reactions. They build\ndevices that actually work in some places, but then they bring it\nsomewhere else, it does not work anymore.\n\n\nIt's\non 60 Minutes,\nthey talked about this. Well, we\ndo not understand. Oh, it must not work.\nThen the scientists say, Well, the\nwhole technology is wrong.\n\n\nNo.\nIt's because, if you are on the grid, it's going to work.\n\n\n\nIt's\nvery simple. let us put all of the cold fusion devices on the grid\nwhere they work, then we will wire them up and we are done. Just build\nit where it needs to go.\n\n\n\nIt's very\nsimple. You have energy in one place, and it's not somewhere else. It\nhappens to be the energy of the time field.\n\n\nWell, look\nat what else you got here. You got the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This is\nthe volcanic ridge that defines what's pushing apart the two\ncontinents.\n\n\nIf\nyou start looking at the next grid which is the Becker-Hagens grid,\nthey have basically taken the same thing... the black dots are Ivan\nSanderson\u2019s twelve vortexes, again, all the matter-time-space\nwarping going on there. You have all the points of the geometric\ninverse of the icosahedron.\n\n\n\nBut\nwhat they do is they actually take two icosahedrons and they put one\nout of phase with the other. Rather than inverting it, they just take\na second icosahedron and make it a little bit out of phase.\n\n\nWe\nhave a phone ringing. That's a sign. Do you guys need a break?\n No? See, we are having mutiny, Kerry. What should\nwe do? The troops do not know what to do.\n\n\n[David\nlistens as Kerry speaks offstage]\n\n\nOkay. All\nright, we will do a short meditation and mentally clear the room.\nThat's why we got the cell phone ringing and distracting me.\n\n\nI\nwould ask that you just take a couple minutes, take a nice deep\nbreath now. If you need to use the restroom, please go because this\nis going to be enough time that you can actually have a break, if you\nneed one. I will not be offended, I promise.\n\n\nSome\nof you are hardcore and are just going to sit through this, that's\ncool. Either way is fine, I will not judge you. we will just laugh about\nyou once you are out of the room. I'll make jokes about you.\n\n\n\nlet us go\ninto the infinite peace of this moment. You may want to close your\neyes. You may want to spend a little time relaxing.\n\n\nJust give\nyourself over to the loving presence of the cosmos. Let yourself feel\nthe articulations of intelligent infinity which speak to you in the\nmoments between moments.\n\n\nGive\nyourself an opportunity to relax into the full awareness of who you\nare. Take comfort in the beauty of you. Take pleasure in the Divine\nEnergy that makes you who you are.\n\n\nAs\nyou tune in deeper and deeper to yourself, you become a pyramid, you\nbecome a standing stone. You become a lens of light for cosmic energy\nto flow through.\n\n\nIt does not\nrequire you to spend any money. It does not require you to have any\nadvanced degree, or university education. It does not require you to\ndrink anything, eat anything, take any pill, smoke anything.\n\n\nAll\nit requires is peace. All it requires is tranquility. All it requires\nis the knowingness that you are more than your physical body, that\nyou are a Divine Light, a glorious gift from the cosmos.\n\n\nThat\nany and all negativity that has hung around you can be cleansed away\nmuch like a traditional housewife would sweep out the house with a\nbroom. With all the doors open, the dust comes flying out. The floors\nbecome clean.\n\n\n\nIt becomes\neasier and easier to walk around undisturbed, to appreciate the\nbounty of your own space, the bounty of your own sovereign identity.\n\n\nFor\nwhen you learn to love yourself, you can have those boundaries, you\ncan sweep out the dust in your own life as we are now doing on the\nplanet.\n\n\n\nThe\nvery air that passes through your lungs is the living conduit of\nuniversal light that carries you like a magic carpet to lands unseen\nthat float in the sky, lands that are beyond physicality. You have\nevery opportunity to reach out and find those lands.\n\n\n\nYou\nhave the glory of being yourself in this moment. You have an\nopportunity to expand your awareness, so that that mind that thinks\nthrough the hardware of the brain is not just the mind of your\npersonal ego but the Universal Mind that is much more than just your\nown personal self.\n\n\nIt\nis the Self with a capital S. let us experience that Self, because as\nyou do, the energy flows through you and it is an energy that creates\nan impenetrable shield that no negativity can penetrate.\n\n\nIt\nis a living vessel of light, the chalice of the Holy Grail that\nallows you to be perfectly sovereign in mind and in body and in\nspirit. By living through that consciousness, you live in the\npresence of your everlasting awareness, your eternal identity, which\nis never going to be terminated by the loss of a body. It is much\nmore than that.\n\n\nYour mind\nis information and the information has identity and the identity is\nthe universe.\n\n\nSo, now I\nwill start to bring you back into the conscious mind. Most of our\nfriends have gone to the bathroom now, so we are all back in the room.\n\n\nI'd\nlike you to see again this grid. Open your eyes and let us meditate on\nthat grid for a minute. you are seeing the underlying geometric\nframework of the mind of the Earth. This is how it has been built and\nthis is what structures the continents the way they are.\n\n\nLook at\nhow the coast of Rio de Janeiro is pushed in by this node. Look at\nhow the whole shape of South America is defined by the lines that\nsurround it. There's many, many examples of this.\n\n\nThis is\nthe stretching pattern that the Earth makes as it expands. You can\nsee island chains that are part of circles. Here is another island\nchain that is part of a larger circle.\n\n\nJust\nconnect those nodes together. Look at the two points in the middle,\nit looks like cell mitosis. That's not an accident.\n\n\n[Listening\nand responding to someone talking to David] Oh, really? Well, that's\ninteresting. I was just informed that there was a UFO sighting right\noutside the building at the time that the cell phone went off. [David\nlaughs, audience responds] Believe it or not. But, ah, that's pretty\ncool.\n\n\nWell,\nthank you guys for showing up. Actually, there is a whole bunch of\nthem on the ceiling here. \n\n\n\n\n\nCool.\nAll right. Hopefully you are a little bit less hypnotized now and\nwe will get back into enough of a thinking mind that you can follow me.\n\n\n\n\nWe\nproved the ancient sites harnessed useable energy. The Russian\npyramid research holds the key. The Russians, after the fall of the\nIron Curtain, had all of their military-industrial complex, all of\ntheir infrastructure, and they had the laboratories available to be\nable to build pyramids and study what they would do. And that's what\nthey did.\n\n\nHere\nare actual photographs of the Russian pyramids. Check this out. These\nare enormous, these are little, bitty, those little dots down there?\nThose are people, okay? So look at that, look at the size of that\nthing.\n\n\nHere is\nsomebody posing in front of it. Here's what it looks like on the\ninside. It's made of PVC plastic pipes with a fiberglass facing.\n\n\nSometimes\nthey are built near oil fields, as you can see here. Sometimes they\nwere built out in the countryside. That is a smaller one; here he is\nposing in front of it.\n\n\nNow,\nsome very, very strange things happened when they did this. They\nbuilt one over an oil well. It would become 25% more productive and\nthe oil that came out was 25% purer.\n\n\nIt\nwould make poisonous chemicals no longer poisonous to the body. They\nwould become safe enough that you could dump it on your skin or drink\nit and you were fine. I do not recommend that you try this, okay? But\nthat's what they said they found.\n\n\nDiseases\nwould be cured, even cancer. It's an energetic phenomenon.\n\n\n\nThey\nhad white, under-bred mice and they injected them with a toxin that\nwould normally destroy them. If 60 % of the mice died from the toxin\nin the laboratory, when they put those same mice under the pyramid,\nguess how many of them died? Only 6%. So 94% of all the mice injected\nwith a lethal toxin that were put in the pyramids that they built\nhere, that you just saw, did not die.\n\n\nUp\nto 400% increase in the productivity of agricultural seeds. You throw\nthese seeds into the pyramid, guess what happens? You grow the same\nplants but now they are 400% larger and they have got better fruit;\neverything is better about them. So you can grow super-seeds.\n\n\nStrong\nelectrical activity. You can put a little voltage pile, a little\nbattery, on top of the pyramid and it generates current. It's\nfascinating.\n\n\nSignificant\nearthquake reduction. This is where you start seeing how the Earth's\nenergy fields are related to severe weather and severe Earth changes.\n\n\nIf you\nbuild these pyramids, then guess what happens with earthquakes? You\ndo not get a big, giant quake anymore. You get a bunch of little ones\nthat do not cause any damage.\n\n\nYou also\nsee an enormous column of energy hundreds of miles wide around the\npyramid. This is not electromagnetic energy. This is the energy which\nthe Russians can measure which they call torsion fields, or the time\nfield.\n\n\nThat\nenergy column, that hundreds-of-miles-wide energy column from one\npyramid is enough to cause big storm fronts coming through to kind of\ngo around it like there is a big circle there. They just WROOP! They\ngo around it. It's crazy. It's been proven.\n\n\nWhat\nthey also did is they took giant slabs of granite that they were\ngoing to use to build these jail cells in Russia - that's a lot\nbetter than an American jail cell, is not it?\n\n\n\nThey\ntake these granite slabs and they built 5,000 prisoners' cells from\nthese granite slabs and they watched these guys. They did not do\nanything else to their environment; they did not do anything else to\ntheir diet or their medication.\n\n\nNow,\none could argue, well, maybe the prisoners were really happy that\nthey had a nice granite cell that they could hang out in. But that's\nnot enough to explain what happened; because they had a profound\nimprovement in their attitude and behavior, including substantial\nincrease in addiction recovery from alcoholism and drug abuse.\n\n\nSo,\nall these prisoners that are living in these jail cells that were\ncharged up with granite from the pyramid... and that's all that it\nwas... all their behavior starts improving because they are living\ninside a harmonic resonating chamber. The granite crystals have\nactually changed their structure.\n\n\nIf\nyou think about how you magnetize an iron nail: You take a piece of\niron, right, like a nail, and you start stroking it with a magnet.\nThe more that you do that, eventually it becomes magnetized and you\ncan pick things up with it.\n\n\n\nWell, we\nknow that the reason why that works is that all the molecules in the\niron are now going north to south in their electrical charge, in the\nsame direction. That's what starts to cause it to happen.\n\n\nSo\nwe know that you can do it to metal. You do not see anything different\nabout the nail, but we know that it becomes magnetic because the\natoms are changing inside.\n\n\nThe\npyramid does the same thing to crystals. You put the granite crystals\ninside, the crystals change.\n\n\nI\ndo not have it in the slide show here, but another thing they did was\njust to take a bunch of granite rocks and just throw them all over\nthe floor and leave them there. What they found was that, if they\ncame back after a few months - the granite is usually a reddish color\n- they came back after a few months and there were rings in the rocks\nthey had just thrown on the ground and the rings were white-ish.\n\n\n\nThe\ngranite changed color. It actually changed from a reddish color to a\nwhite-ish color in a ring. That's how much these fields change\ncrystals and their actual structure.\n\n\nWhen\nyou get to the point of earthquakes and how earthquakes can be\nchanged and reduced by the pyramids, and how human behavior is\nimproved by the pyramids \u2013 you just put the prisoners in those\ngranite cells and they get much better \u2013 this proves that our\nconsciousness is tethered to the Earth's consciousness.\n\n\n\nYou\nharness the Earth's consciousness with the pyramid that acts like a\nfunnel for this energy. The energy that builds each molecule of the\npyramid is an energy that is in you. So the energy that makes you who\nyou are can be harnessed in the pyramid just by the fact that it is\nshaped that way.\n\n\nThere\nis an energy that flows into every atom in that pyramid, and if the\npyramid is a perfect sphere, then it's going to all flow in the same\nway; but, if it's a funnel shape, it's going to flow in with a\ndirectional current. That's all it is \u2013 it's a funnel. It's\nvery, very simple.\n\n\n\nThis\nproves the connection between our consciousness and earthquakes, a\nconnection between our consciousness and severe weather, a strong\nlikelihood that our consciousness is directly affecting the Earth.\nThat's a very important point.\n\n\nOf\ncourse, the greatest pyramid of all is, not surprisingly, called the\n\"Great Pyramid\". We know that when you go inside the Great\nPyramid, they have this sarcophagus that you lie in and the ancient\ntechnique was that it would cause you to have this meeting with your\nshadow, a projection of your shadow.\n\n\nYou\ngo into an out-of-body consciousness, and you go into this other\nrealm which is time-space as we would now call it. You encounter your\nshadow projection. If you can heal yourself, which means if you\nembrace your shadow...\n\n\nYou\nknow the best thing you can do if you are in a nightmare and something\nis chasing you and you are terrified of it -- do not keep running. Stop\nrunning, turn around and say: Who are\nyou, and what do you want? do not be\nafraid at all; get rid of the fear.\n\n\nWhat\nyou'll find is that, if you are not afraid of it, you are going to\nstart seeing it change. The more that it changes, the more that\nyou'll see that it is yourself. When you realize that it's yourself,\nyou embrace it and there's this huge flash of white light \u2013 you\nhave this amazing experience and you wake up in tears.\n\n\nMany\npeople have reported this. That is the integration process the\npyramid is talking about, except in the pyramid it's so powerful that\nyou literally come out with ascended abilities. You literally can do\nthings that we would consider miracles, such as telekinesis,\nlevitation, instant healing, telepathy, etcetera.\n\n\nWell...\nit's not everybody\u2019s experience. Napoleon went into the King's\nChamber. What do you think happens to a guy like that when he spends\na night in the sarcophagus? This is what he wrote after it happened:\nHe was absolutely terrified. He had a\nhorrible night. He never wanted to go anywhere near it again.\n\n\nSo\nI ask you this, when the apple fell in front of Sir Isaac Newton, was\nthat the first time that gravity was working?  No, it was the\nfirst time someone recognized that gravity was working.\n\n\nIs this\npresentation and the signs that we have been putting together recently\nthe first time that anybody has recognized that this is working on\nEarth? No, right?\n\n\n\nBecause\nwhat? Pyramids \u2013 global grid \u2013 everybody built it on the\ngrid. Why did they build it on the grid? Because they saw the apple\nfall, they knew there was an energy field responsible for that.\nExcept in this case it is not an apple falling, it's a consciousness\nrising.\n\n\nSo\nhave we seen the apple fall in modern times? The answer is NO. we are\ntrying to explain everything on electromagnetic energy and we do not\nunderstand that there is an energy beneath electromagnetic energy\nthat's even more important.\n\n\n[slide\nreads: Is There Really a \"God\" That Can Be Explained\nScientifically?]\n\n\nThis\nreally becomes a scientific validation of the idea of a Higher Power,\nthat there is some Divine Intelligence that is more than you and me\nin separated brain-pans, and there's nothing else that's there.\nThat's the old way of thinking.\n\n\nThe\nnew way of thinking is that consciousness is a field and that field\nmust exist through the whole universe, because consciousness is the\nbasic behavior of matter. So matter is not just in this Galaxy --\nit's all over the place. It all seems to have all the same, if not\nsimilar, rules; therefore consciousness is very likely to be\neverywhere.\n\n\n[slide\nreads: Crop Circles and 2012 - Messages From \"God\"?]\n\n\nwe are\ngoing to go back into 2012. Now, we have built a lot of background for\nthis, so let us go into 815 AD, which is actually the first documented\nrecord of crop circles coming down.\n\n\nCrop\ncircles are not new. They have messages in them in the form of\npictures written into crops and those pictures will show us that\nthere is somebody out there who wants us to figure out a puzzle, who\nwants us to solve a mystery.\n\n\n815\nAD: If you look at these lavish, sunny, lovely quarters, it's\nactually very Gothic and gloomy. This is the Archbishop of Lyons\nissuing an edict called Against the\nFoolish Opinion of the Masses About Hail and Thunder.\n\n\nPeople\nbelieved in \"cloud ships\" from a place they called\n\"Magonia\". What do you think a cloud ship is? Do you think\nthat's a cloud?\n\n\nNo.\nThink about it. A cloud ship is not a cloud. A cloud ship is\nsomething that they see flying in the air and they say: Well,\nclouds fly in the air. It's a cloud ship.\n\n\nThey\nbelieved that these cloud ships were flattening crops into circles\nbecause the cloud ships says, Well,\nI am going to protect you from bad weather, but here is what you need\nto do for me. If I am going to protect you, then you need to let me\nflatten these circles out in your crops.\n\n\nIt's kind\nof a weird deal to make with cloud ships but, what the hell, that's\nwhat they thought was going on.\n\n\nAgobard\nissued a prohibition against any locals taking seeds out of the crop\ncircles for pagan fertility rituals.\n\n\n\nSo\nwhat that means is that people were getting a bliss hit from the\nenergized crops. They would build little huts out of them and stuff,\nand they would want to have a pagan fertility ritual in them which,\nof course, means what were they doing inside the little grass hut?\nHm, I wonder. \n\n\nThat\nwas purely subconscious. I have no idea what I am doing there [rubs\nhis index fingers together]. Or, I could go... [makes suggestive\ngesture using microphone; audience laughs] No, there is no subtext.\nI am not giving you any subtext.\u00a0\n\n\nObviously,\nwhat's going on is the farmers are getting really angry because\nthey are losing their crops. So the farmers start saying: Hey\nyou guys, stop doing this.\n\n\nAnd\nthey say: No, man. Check it out! The\nenergy is amazing.\n\n\nThe\nfarmers are like: Oh my God.\n\n\nSo\nback then, the church was basically the government, so they go to\nthe... basically, the equivalent of the government and they say,\nHey, look, okay, we have got to stop these people.\nSo Agobard, being also the Governor, basically, has to issue this\nprohibition.\n\n\nWell,\nguess what it was all built around? It was built around crop circles;\nperfect circles in the crop 1200 years ago. Are crop circles new? No!\n\n\nAll right.\n\n\n[slide:\n1880 Illustration of Fairy Rings]\n\n\n\"Elferingewort\"\nis a fairy ring - a ring of daisies caused by elves dancing - a\nlegend that dates to the 12th century. I found this on Wikipedia, of\nall places. This is the people that are partying and dancing and\nmaking the thing fall down in the angelic realm. That is what they\nbelieved caused these rings, from 1880.\n\n\nThis\nis a strange story. Look at this. This is the equivalent of headline\nnews in 1678.\n\n\nThis\nis what happened: Somebody comes over to chop down a farmer's crop.\nHe's called a mower. The mower wanted a lot of money. The farmer\nwas not willing to pay that much, so the farmer gets all pissed off\nand says, I'd rather have the Devil\nchop down these crops than you, man.\n\n\nThat\nnight, the farmer's in bed and the whole field lights up like it's on\nfire. The perfect circle appeared in the crops the next morning, as\nit says in this thing you just saw: So\nneatly mow'd that no mortal man could have done it.\n\n\nWell,\nnow we believe it was a bunch of drunk guys walking around, Eh,\nis not this great? we are making a crop circle.\n That's not the way it worked back then. They\nwere smart enough to know that no person could have done this.\n\n\nSo this is\nthe illustration. So, of course, if no person could have done it,\nit's got to be the devil. It's obvious. Everybody knows that. So,\nit's the devil.\n\n\n[slide:\nThe \"Mowing Devil\"; 1678 picture]\n\n\nThere\nhe is, doing his little job: perp-perp-perp-perp-perp. He's in no\nhurry; he's going around doing his thing.\n\n\n[next\nslide: Dr. Robert Plot (1640-1696)]\n\n\nOkay,\nnow we have Dr. Robert Plot, who\u2019s at the beginning of the\nRenaissance, a very educated and enlightened scientist, who was smart\nenough to look at the hip bone of a Megalosaurus and see something\nentirely different. It's the world's first homoerotic paleontologist\nbecause he saw the scrotum of a giant here. What a boner that would\nbe. \n\n\nAll right.\nSo what he did is he started to look at these crop circles forming\nand he actually drew pictures of them in the 1600s. These are his\nactual photographs.\n\n\nThese\nare not just \"circles\". That's a spiral. That looks like\nsomebody's ear with a sound wave going into it. And here is a perfect\nsquare inside a perfect circle.\n\n\nSo\nDr. Robert Plot's educated hypothesis was: Oh,\nwell, there is a piece of square wind, you see. The square wind is\nmaking a square hole in the crops.\n\n\n\nThat\nis actually not much better than what modern scientists are trying to\nsay for crop circles now, so nothing has changed for 400 years,\nunfortunately.\n\n\nHe\nalso found that the soil underneath the crop circles was much drier\nthan ordinary, which smelled like moldy bread. But then what does the\nguy do? He puts it in his mouth and he tastes it \u2013 that's a\ndedicated scientist! Oh my God, it's\nhorrible. Blah! [faking British\naccent]\n\n\n\nExcept\nhe found that it did not taste bad, so what do we know this is? This\nis all the water being zapped out of the soil; it's totally dried\nout. That's a cosmic thing that happened. That\u2019s\nextraterrestrial technology.\n\n\nDr.\nGil Levengood documented the same thing in the 1990s, exactly the\nsame thing, so it's still working the same way.\n\n\n[slide:\nWilliam Cyril Williams, late 1940s]\n\n\nIn\nthe late 1940s, somebody witnessed a whirlwind touching down and\nforming a circle in the corn; he believed it was wind. In only three\nor four seconds, you have this perfect sharp-edged circle that was\nvery large, three or four meters wide, happen. It's about 30 feet -\nnot quite thirty feet, but it's big, like 15, 20 feet.\n\n\n[slide:\nBryce Bond / A Shuttlewood 1972]\n\n\nAugust\n1972 in Warminster, he hears a noise, something pushes down the\nwheat. But check out the last line, what does it say? The air was\nwhat? Completely still.\nThere was nothing going on, no wind that could have explained what\nhappened here.\n\nIn\nfront of my eyes I could see a great imprint taking shape. The wheat\nwas forced down in a clockwise direction.\nHe hears a high-pitched humming noise and the circle opens up like an\noriental fan unfolding.\n\n\nGuess what\nguys? That's not weather, that's not wind, that's not a bunch of\ndrunk guys walking around stamping down the crops. This guy witnessed\nit. We can put people in prison based on eyewitness testimony. That's\nwhat he saw.\n\n\n[next\nslide - view of crop circles]\n\n\nWell,\nlet us stop talking about them and start looking at them because\nthat's where it gets more fun. Here you have the original type of\ncircles you'd see, and then you start to get these patterns of four,\nand there's a little one down here \u2013 that was originally called\nGrapeshot.\n\n\n[next\nslide]\n\n\nThese\nkinds of patterns start showing up all the time: Two circles\nconnected by a line with this little arch - sometimes it was there,\nsometimes it was not - which, in pagan symbolism, is the pregnant\ngoddess. This is the pregnant belly; here's the head and here's the\narms.\n\n\nBut, of\ncourse, the circle makers could not be content by showing us such\nprimitive diagrams, so they came back a couple years ago and they did\nthis:\n\n\n[next\nslide: goddess crop circle photo]\n\n\nHere we\nhave the goddess, of course, in a geometric form but it's very\nclearly obvious that's what we are seeing again. This is the rebirth\nof the Earth, coming into being.\n\n\n[next\nslide]\n\n\nYou see\nthree goddess formations in this, from 1990. This was Alton Barnes\n1990.\n\n\nIt made it\non to the cover of the Led Zeppelin CD box set, actually. That's a\nmuch nicer version of the photograph, too, before everybody tamped it\ndown like you see in this one. All these footsteps messing it up over\nhere. It's not there.\n\n\n[next\nslide: Barbury Castle, August 11, 1991 crop circle photo]\n\n\nWell,\nthis one is one of the greatest ones in terms of the impact that it\nhad. Richard Hoagland is really the one who made this most popular.\nIt shows, basically... we think it shows... first dimension, second\ndimension, third dimension and then fourth in the middle, the\ngeometry. These lines are perfectly equated with a tetrahedron inside\na sphere.\n\n\n[next\nslide]\n\n\nThis\nis a situation where a bunch of people were sitting around studying\ncrop circles and they said: Oh, wow,\nwould not it be great if they did a Mandelbrot set, this fractal?\nThe very next day it shows up in the crop, so somebody's listening!\n\n\n[next\nslide: Stonehenge, July 7, 1996 crop circle photo]\n\n\nA truck\ndriver drives his truck by this part of the field, he does not see\nanything there. Fifteen minutes later the farmer is going out there\nand he sees this thing in his crops. It was not there 15 minutes\nearlier, showed up in 15 minutes, in 1996.\n\n\nSurveyors\nwere asked how long it would take to do this if you plotted it all\nout on the ground. They said minimum 2-3 days, and that would be if\nyou really worked all day and all night.

Well, here, you are really stupid so we are\ngoing to give you another one.\n\n\n[next\nslide: crop circle photo - looks like a snowflake inside a snowflake]\n\nwe will\nput a snowflake in it this time just so you can figure it out.\n People still do not get it.\n\n\n[next\nslide: intricately detailed crop circle photo]\n\n\n[fake\nBritish accent] Now that is obviously\ncaused by an army of hedgehogs running around and around and around.\nThere is a perfectly rational scientific explanation: a bunch of\ndrunk gentlemen coming back from the pub one night with long boards\non their feet and a funny cap with a string, and they are walking\naround and around, tamping down the crop circle, having the greatest\ntime of their lives making absolutely geometrically precise\nformations in record time over one night.\n\n\nI\ndo not think that's what happened. And this is the kind of stuff they\nwere doing 1200 years ago, causing Agobard to prohibit the pagans\nfrom taking these things out for fertility rituals, all the crops\nfrom these circles. This is what they are doing now \u2013 it's the\nsame technology.\n\n\n\n[next\nslide]\n\n\nThat's\nmy favorite one yet. Never seen one that makes me happier than that\none. Look at the precision. There is not a single part of this that's\ngeometrically out of alignment. Nobody on the ground could have done\nthat in the one night that it showed up in; it's just too complex.\n\n\n[next\nslide reads: Suggestions of Genetic Changes / Evolution?]\n\n\nWell,\nthere's a message in there. Genetic change is in evolution.\n\n\n[next\nslide: photo of Froxfield \"Chromosome\" Formation, August\n18, 1991]\n\n\nLook\nat this. This is chromosomes breaking in 1991. When chromosomes\nbreak, that means the cell is about to divide. That's what this is\nshowing you, so there is some sort of evolution happening.\n\n\n[next\nslide: three DNA formation photos]\n\n\nYou\nlook in 1996; you see a very clear illustration of DNA. Do you see\nthe double helix there? Can everybody see that? I also want you to\npay attention to this shape right here. I want you should look at\nthat shape, memorize that little part. we are going to get back to\nthat in a minute.\n\n\nThis is\nthe same kind of sine wave you see here but it is in a geometric\npattern. That's '99. Now, look what happens less than a month later.\nExactly the same formation, but now it's got even more strands.\n\n\nSo\nit's saying something is going to be happening to DNA. That's the\nsuggestion. That's one suggestion... there are others.\n\n\n[next\nslide]\n\n\nHere is\none again that is showing you DNA but it's in a perfect circle, a\nperfect ring. You can obviously see the double helix and the little\nladders connecting the two sides together. It's beautiful.\n\n\n[next\nslide]\n\n\nBut\nthis is the one that really gets me off. You have the Galaxy in the\ncenter, the Milky Way Galaxy, and then you have these waves of DNA,\nand you have this pattern being flagged. Look at that. There's your\ndouble helix. Everybody see that? This is being pumped out by the\nGalaxy.\n\n\n\nBut\nlook at this. In the Hebrew mystical tradition that's a special shape\ncalled a \"Yod\", which refers to Divine Light coming down\ninto manifestation on the Earth.\n\n\nI\ndo not have it in this particular slide show but if you look at the\nTower card in the Tarot, there's all these Yods around the Tower\nthat's being struck by lightening. That represents Divine\nManifestation.\n\n\nSo\nthis is actually a further message saying that this DNA energy is a\nDivine Manifestation.\n\n\n[next\nslide: formation of sun with planets orbiting]\n\n\nThe\ndefinitive 2012 formation is right here. This showed up last year and\nwhat it does \u2013 or it might have been this year, was not it? Man,\nit has not been that long. Oh no, I think it was last year, I am sorry.\nI have been using this ever since it showed up.\n\n\n\nNow,\nthere's some interesting things going on here. We look at the Sun,\nokay? Now, look at the diameter of the Sun. We know that all of these\nobjects here represent the planets, and it's a specific planetary\nalignment.\n\n\n[next\nslide: \"The inner part of Avebury Manor matches our inner Solar\nSystem for a date of December 22, 2012\" with diagrams]\n\n\nWell, it's\nactually December 21st.

You see all the positions of the planets are the same\nas what's in the crop confirmation. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, they are\nall in the same positions.\n\n\n\nUranus,\nNeptune, Pluto. Pluto is not in the same position. It could be that\nit would have broken the geometric harmony because it would have had to\nhave been right about here.\n\n\nNow,\nI have had a little tip from, let us say, a source. This is a human\nsource. This is somebody here, not any extraterrestrial. He told me\nto pay attention to this.\n\n\n\nHe\nsays that also is part of the message, even though it looks like it\nis just an irregularity in the ground. Why was it built so it's right\nthere? Is there something that we might be encountering in the future\nthat is right there in the Solar System? That's what we are being\ntold.\n\n\nThat's all\nI can say on that, but I want you to think about that.\n\n\n[next\nslide]\n\n\nWell,\nlook at what happens here. The Sun, after a couple days, is now\nwidened to the orbit of Venus. Does this not suggest that something\nis going to happen to the Solar System on guess what day? December\n21, 2012.\n\n\nThey\ngave you the planetary alignment and they give you what's going to\nhappen. They show you the Sun. They show you the Sun changing in a\nvery, very, very, very dramatic way. This does not mean it's going to\nkill us.\n\n\nThe other\nthings show that it's an energetic change. And it would also appear\nthat this indicates some sort of energetic influx and that these\nindicate all the ET groups that are surrounding us at this time.\nThese are code ciphers for different planetary civilizations that are\ncoming in.\n\n\n[next\nslide reads: Interplanetary Climate Change: NASA's Hottest Secret]\n\n\nSo,\nthis gets us into interplanetary climate change. I am not going to\nspend a whole lot of time on this stuff, because there is so much of\nthis data, but this is the smoking gun. When anybody tells you: Oh,\nthere's nothing that's changed and it's all the same old stuff -- \nit's not true, it's not true.\n\n\n[next\nslide: \"Solar Activity Highest in 8,000 Years!\" with\ngraphs]\n\n\nFirst\nof all, let us look at the activity of the Sun. It's the highest it's\never been in 8,000 years. This is taken from Antarctic and Arctic ice\ncore samples which have been correlated with tree rings and all the\nother stuff they use.\n\n\n11,000\nago \u2013 the fall of Atlantis \u2013 look at how high it is. It's\nalmost that high now. It's the highest it's been in 8,000 years.\n\n\n\n[next\nslide: Telegraph.co.uk article \"Scientists baffled by speed of\nSun\u2019s storms']\n\n\nThe\nsun is now giving off storms that used to take two or more hours to\nget here, showers of protons. Last year\u2026 well, that's 2005,\nI am sorry. In 2005, one of them got here in 15 minutes.\n\n\nThat\nmeans the energy in the Solar System is conducting those particles\nfaster, which means it's charging up. The energy is vibrating faster,\nthe particles move faster. It's very simple.\n\n\nNASA\nis now warning of a space Katrina in, guess what year? 2012. they are\nsaying that the Sun could have a massive radiation blast, just like\nit's possible that the crop circle was showing us here.\n\n\nEven\nArmy studies, mainstream government studies, are saying that the Sun\ncould be driving all the climate change on the Earth. Obviously,\nwe are seeing it's at an all-time 8,000-year high.\n\n\nThe\nsolar wind is slowing down. That's still been happening, it's very\nweak. And at the same time, the Sun's bubble -- the actual magnetic\nfield of the Sun -- has gotten 25% smaller. The most likely\nexplanation for that is that the outside is pushing in on it.\n\n\nThere's\nsomething pushing in on it making it smaller. That's what would most\nlikely be causing this, which again suggests that we are moving into\nan area in the Galaxy where there is a higher energetic charge.\n\n\n\nWe\nhave been in touch with insider witnesses, thanks to Project Camelot,\nand one of the things that we have heard is that we do have this fleet\nof ships out there, outside the Solar System, and they have looked at\nthis wave coming in.\n\n\nThey\nknow there's a wave, they know it's coming in and they are studying it\nand they see that it's coming into the Solar System. So they are\npaying attention, but they are not going to tell us until the last\nminute, which is just enough time for everybody to panic while they\nrun away. \n\n\nBut\nthat's not what this is about. This is about genetic change, and this\nis about evolution, and it's not a doom-and-gloom thing.\n\n\n\nEven\nthough I am showing you stuff that you could think about in a fearful\nway, all of these messages, all these crop formations that they have\nbuilt up 1,200 years of credibility to show you genetic evolution.\nthey are not showing you doom and gloom.\n\n\nWhat\nwould be the point? If it's an intelligent cosmos, why would it\ncreate life on this beautiful planet, just to belch it off in a big\nsolar flare? That's not what this about.\n\n\nGalactic\ndust. There is more dust that came in between 2000-2001 -- 300% more\nthan all the 1990s combined. That's another major study that was\nfound.\n\n\nIf\nyou look at Mercury; Mercury's magnetosphere in 2008 was much more\npowerful than it was seen in The Seventies with Mariner 10. Here's\nthe actual mainstream publication where that came through.\n\n\nNow,\njust recently, they go back a year later and they see even more\nstuff. They found magnetic tornadoes, magnetic twisters, and they\nsaid one of the biggest surprises was how strongly the dynamics of\nthe planet's magnetic field / solar wind interaction had changed from\nthe first Mercury fly-by in January 2008.\n\n\nSo,\nwhat this is telling you is that Mercury has changed dramatically in\nits magnetic field in ONE YEAR. That's it, Mercury is going nuts.\nThat's the first planet in the Solar System.\n\n\nThat's\nnot the only planet that's doing this. Look at Venus: 2,500% increase\nin the green glow in less than 20 years, looking like this right\nhere. That's totally amazing.\n\n\nOn Mars\nyou have the appearance of clouds. You see the clouds here that\nwere not there? Mars did not use to have clouds or ozone. they have only\nappeared in the last 30 years or so. It's another major change.\n\n\nMainstream\nmedia has reported on global warming on Mars. Guess what?\u00a0\nNobody's driving SUVs on Mars. At least, if they are, there's\nprobably a lot less of them than there are on Earth and they probably\nrun on free energy, based on what our whistleblowers are telling us.\n\n\nBut\nsomething is melting the ice caps on Mars.\n\n\nJupiter\nhas this plasma torus that you could not see before 1974 and yet now\nit looks like this? As time goes on, the density of this torus as you\nsee here is getting 200% thicker - this is the natural saucering\nmovement that it makes as the moon Io is going around its orbit.\n\n\nWell,\nthey get so bored, they are: Ah, uh,\nstronger than expected.\n\n\n200%\nincrease in the whole density of this thing in, basically, 25 years,\n15 years -- very, very short time. Fifteen years, every single\nparticle inside this thing gets 50 percent denser. They say: Well,\nit exceeded expectations. Okay, no\nbiggie.\n\n\nJupiter's\nwhite ovals disappeared in three years. There's three of them up\nhere, then you see there's two and now there's one. Dr. Phillip\nMarcus believed this would cause an 18-degree global warming on\nJupiter in only a decade.\n\n\nWell,\nguess what? It's a decade later and now Jupiter is having raging heat\nthunderstorms that they are calling global upheaval \u2013 just what\nhe predicted would happen.\n\n\nThese are\ninfrared heat signatures that were not there before; much higher\nintensity.\n\n\nNow, you\ncamera guys, can you shoot either one of these, because I am just\nrealizing that over here we have light on that slide and over here we\ndo not have any light, so that's a better one for me to be using my\npointer on. I think I am going to switch over to this one now.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh!\nSomebody throw stones at the idiot here.  All right, never\nmind. let us keep going.\n\n\nThe\nstorms appeared during a dramatic planet-wide disturbance that's\nongoing on Jupiter. It's yet to be explained, but it's changed the\ncolor of the stripes. Its storms are probably tied in with a global\nupheaval.\n\n\nIo's\nionosphere, the moon that we were showing you before: 1,000%\nhigher. That's all the charged\nparticles which are coming from the Sun.  Ah,\nit's unexpected.\n\n\nThis is\nridiculous. This is our entire backyard. I have showed you every\nplanet.\n\n\nMercury's\nhaving magnetic tornadoes. Mercury is having so much change that in\none year, it's gone nuts.\n\n\nVenus\nis having a 2,500% increase in its green glow.\n\n\nMars is\nhaving global warming and ozone in the atmosphere and clouds that\nwere not there before.\n\n\nNow you are\ngoing out to Jupiter, you are seeing this plasma torus show up, all\nthe particles are getting bigger, there's more and more of them.\n\n\nYou\nlook at the moon Io, it's the same thing. The ionosphere is 1,000%\nhigher. The surface has gotten 200% hotter, three times hotter than\nMercury? How did that happen? Surprised? Oh\nyeah, we cannot explain it. [makes\nsnoring sound] Okay.\n\n\nEuropa is\nmuch brighter than expected. This is what they thought it would look\nlike based on what it used to look like, and this is what they\nactually got. Look at all that light.\n\n\nGanymede,\nsame thing, 200% brighter. A 1,000% increase in its density of its\natmosphere.\n\n\nSaturn's\nplasma torus, 1,000% denser; same thing, short period of time,\nbasically twelve years.\n\n\nAurorae\nare being seen in the polar regions of Saturn. Here's another new\nthing: that's heat that was not there before. Massive X-rays were seen\nfor the first time near the equator of Saturn in 2004.\n\n\nUranus was\nas featureless as a cue ball in 1986, but look at what happens to it\nby '99.\n\n\nDr.\nErich Karkoschka finally has some of the childlike enthusiasm we\nreally should see. These are really\nbig, big changes, man! Check it out! It's incredible. It's been hit\nby huge storms, dude. So he's\nfinally got it right.\n\n\n\n[makes\nsnoring sound] Seasonal brightness\nchanges, not well understood. Moving\non --\nthat's the official NASA report.\n\n\nUranus\nin 2004 is even brighter. Now, I am going to superimpose the original\nover what you have got here. Look at how much this is changing. All\nthat stuff is new. All this bright stuff was not there before.\n\n\nWell,\nguess what happens when you go out to Neptune? Exactly the same\nthing. This is what it looked like in 1999.\n\n\nThis is\nwhat it looked like in 1996: zero degrees, quarter rotation, half\nrotation, three quarter rotation; doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.\n\n\nThen\nwe go up to 1998, you see that there's more brightness coming in. But\nlook what happens in 2002. It's gone 40% brighter in near infrared,\nwhich is just above visible light. If you could see this spectrum,\nthis is what it would look like. To the naked eye it's not changing\nthat much, but this has only barely above what our eyes can see as\nvisible light.\n\n\n[slide\nreads: 1989-2002: Massive Changes]\n\n\nSo,\nnow I am going to show you what it looks like as it goes from '89 to\n2002. Watch. Watch the bottom. Look at how much it's changing. Do you\nthink this is just a random thing that's being caused by the tilt of\nthe equator of the planet relative to the Sun? No. This is a\nplanet-wide, Solar-System-wide effect.\n\n\nGlobal\nwarming on Pluto: 300% increase in its atmospheric pressure from '89\nto 2002. It's moving away\nfrom the Sun, but the surface of the planet is getting hotter as it\nmoves away from the Sun, which is causing the atmosphere to charge\nup.\n\n\nSo,\nthis shows us that Earth changes are not unique to the Earth \u2013\nthey are happening all over the place.\n\n\n\nNow, Bill\nand Kerry, I see you guys over there. How much time do we have, what\nare we on here? Okay.\n\n\nWell,\nthere's all sorts of different places we can stop and start in this\npresentation, and I wanted to get you guys, sort of like when I do\nthese longer weekends at my conferences - like I am having one in\nLondon next month - we can actually drill into this data a lot more,\nand there is a lot more data than I actually have had time to go into\nhere, but that's why I make these presentations modular.\n\n\nBut\nwhat you are seeing here is, if you look through, I am going to\nsummarize some of this stuff and zip a little faster, so we can get\nto the punch line.\n\n\n[slide\nshows graph, reads: Continuous Rise in Earthquakes]\n\n\nwe are\nseeing continuous rises in Earth change activity - let me do it from\nthis side - earthquakes, volcanic activity going up; sea levels going\nup, temperatures going up; tornadoes are going up; disasters, natural\ndisasters; economic losses on Earth -- all this stuff.\n\n\n\nThe\nentire Pacific Ocean sea floor is heating up, which is obviously what\nhappens when the Sun warms up water on the surface of the ocean. Then\nthose warm water particles are sinking down to the bottom where they\nwarm up the bottom of the ocean.\n\n\nThat's\nwhat the scientists are actually saying is going on. So of course,\nthe next time you want to boil water and boil some eggs, just get a\nhair dryer and brrrrrrr -- it'll work just fine, I promise. Hm, hm!\n\n\nThat's\nhow they have explained this, because they cannot tell you that the\nEarth is heating up from the inside. That's all it is. The planets\nare heating up from the inside.\n\n\nWhy\nare they heating up from the inside? Galactic energy fields. What are\nthe Galactic energy fields going to do? Change your DNA. So, let us\nget to that.\n\n\nWe have to\ngo through some stuff here.  All right.\nwe will get to this because this is good.\n\n\nBacteria.\nIf you look in the Antarctic ice, in the interior of a volcano, even\ninside a nuclear reactor, you'll find little critters. they are\neverywhere. They even survive in space; they have been recovered after\nbeing frozen for ten million years.\n\n\n\nIt's\nas if some life force takes that existing body that was there and you\nthaw it out and it says: Oh, okay,\nthat's a body. I am going to make it alive.\nSo, there's something going on here, something more than we usually\nthink of life as being.\n\n\n\nSome\nbacteria thrive on infrared light, they photosynthesize in near\ndarkness; and they have been found miles below the surface of the\nocean floor.\n\n\n\nIt\nis ridiculous to think that all these critters grew from living\nbacteria, from other living bacteria. It becomes much more plausible\nthat those little bacteria that grew inside the nuclear reactor\ndid not come from other bacteria that grow inside nuclear reactors,\nthat are sort of floating around saying, Hm,\nlet me find a nuclear reactor; oh look, there's one.\n\n\nNo,\nthose nuclear reactors are hermetically sealed for a reason, but\nthey are not sealed from the Source Field. they are not sealed from\nthis energy that goes in there and says, Oh,\nhere's a place where I can make life.\n- This is like what happens in a star. - Let\nme go ahead and jump in there and they start creating life.\n\n\nSo,\nthey call this a \u201cproblem\u201d, but it's actually a proof.\nIt's a proof that life is everywhere in the universe.\n\n\n\nDr.\nChandra Wickramasinghe \u2013 say that three times fast; and try to\nspell it while you are pronouncing it (I have had to practice that, I\nmight add) \u2013 has proven that the organic material in comets is\nbiological; it has critters in it. There're billions of comets in the\nSolar System alone and he believes that all life on Earth may have\ncome here from a comet.\n\n\nThis\nis Dr. Francis Crick, the co-founder of DNA. What he shows us is that\nit is way too complex to have evolved by random chance. It's as if\nthe entire Encyclopedia Britannica fell out of the sky, one word at a\ntime, and it all happened to arrange like those monkeys on\ntypewriters. That's the kind of logical idiocy that is involved to\ntry to say that DNA is a Darwinian mutation from random accidents.\n\n\n[bottom\nof slide reads: \"99.9% of all dust in the Galaxy has the\nspectrographic signature of bacteria!\"]\n\n\nHere's\nhis biggest discovery! Now, this is the same guy who discovered DNA.\nWhy is not this as popular as his other discovery? He looks at all the\ndust in the line of sight between where we are on Earth and the\ncenter of the Galaxy and all of it looks just like bacteria in its\nheat signature and its light signature. Exactly the same. It IS\nbacteria.\n\n\nSo\nthis is Howard Hughes\u2019 worst nightmare: space\nis filled with germs. \ndo not go to space if you are a germophobe.\n\n\nEven\nthe mainstream media is saying space  that creates human life\nis found in other solar systems.\n\n\nWell,\nwe know that space has these Source Field differences. There is a\nSource Field energy in space that you do not see here on Earth. It's\ncalled the Overview Effect, or Space Euphoria. Astronauts go out\nthere and they get this massive energetic high from being in space.\nIt's been reported by many of them.\n\n\nThe\nChinese have taken seeds and flown them into space - and it's\nimportant that you do this in a space capsule that does not have PVC\nplastic windows and does not have aluminum in the chassis. If you do\nthat, which is what the NASA probes are like, it does not work. It\nwill not work. If you have any PVC plastic at any point over the\nwindows, they are not going to do this. And if you have aluminum in\nthe body of the thing, it's not going to work.\n\n\nThe\nChinese built one that did not do it that way and what happens is,\nthey send these seeds out into space, and remember what I said about\nthe pyramids built by the Russians? They tossed the seeds in and what\nhappened to the seeds? 400% more productive seeds; 400% bigger\nplants.\n\n\nWould\nyou like to see the kind of crops that the Chinese were growing when\nthey just flew the seeds into space? let us go for it. Bang! There's\nyour pumpkin. That's the only thing they have done is grow it\nhydroponically and regular hydroponic pumpkins do not do this. This is\na space pumpkin. That's the only thing they did is fly it into space.\n\n\n[in a low\nvoice] It's the mystery of the Great Pumpkin from space. Every\nHalloween he comes in a UFO. \n\n\nNow\nthis, is not that amazing? That is actually called a bitter\ngrow. It is not a whale penis.\n Contrary to your belief, it is actually a melon.\n\n\nNow, you\nknow those little hot peppers, right? Those little hot \"Oh,\nJesus!\", or maybe you really like it, maybe you are a sadist\nand, \"Oh, this is wonderful.\" Okay.\n\n\nlet us look\nat some hot peppers. That's a lot bigger than they are supposed to be.\nThat's amazing stuff.\n\n\nSo,\nis this the source of all life? Is all life found in an energy wave?\n\n\n\nWell,\ncheck this out. This is Dr. James Strick, Sparks\nof Life, major scientific\nconspiracy, 19th century. Many of these guys were arguing in favor of\nDarwin random mutation and others argued for spontaneous generation,\nlife from non-living things. They did not know whether it was one or\nthe another.\n\n\nThey\nfound numerous experimental examples of \"spontaneous\ngeneration\". Pasteur had cases where life originated from\nnon-living things, so it's not as easily dismissed as we would like\nto believe. Louis Pasteur is why you have \"pasteurized\"\nmilk.\n\n\n\nAll\nof these guys created a conspiracy where they buried data, where you\nhave sterilized test tubes where nothing could grow in there and\ncritters grew in there anyway. They threw it all away, because they\nwanted to believe Darwin was right, because survival of the fittest\nis an Illuminati philosophy that says: If\nI am the best killer, then I am the most evolved on the planet.\n\n\nThat's\nhow they felt about themselves, so they enforced it into the\nscientific structure of the world. History has been completely\nrewritten in favor of that model.\n\n\nSo\nnow this is a big mouthful, and here's the guy's name, which is also\na big mouthful. Professor Pacheco, you can find this on\nhttps://www.orgone.org/articles/ax2001igna01a.htm\n. \n\n\nIt's\nvery simple. What he did is he takes beach sand and he heats it up to\nwhite hot luminescence; it's literally white hot, and then he takes\nthat sterilized beach sand and he throws it into a sterilized test\ntube with sterilized distilled water in a vacuum, so there's no way\nanything could have gotten in there.\n\n\nFive\ndays later, this scum has grown on top of the test tube. He scrapes\nit off and looks at it under a microscope. Would you like to see some\nof the little things that he saw in there? let us go for it.\n\n\nThis is\nthe first one. It looks like a little brain.\n\n\nHere's\nsomething that looks like it might be part of perhaps a sea\nvegetable, like one of the leaves broke off when he put it under the\nmicroscope. let us look up close on that little guy and tell me if you\nthink this is biological.\n\n\nWhere\ndid his DNA come from? All that was, was sand; there was nothing else\nin there. He sterilized the sand, he sterilized the water, sterilized\nthe air, and yet, this little critter grew in there. And that's just\none part of a bigger plant. There're pictures of where you see the\nplant.\n\n\nHere's\nanother one that looks like a red blood cell. Here's one that looks\nlike a white blood cell or a leukocyte. But here comes -- drum roll\nplease -- the bomdiggity.\nThis little guy probably has 20,000 to 30,000 genes, which is about\nthe same as you. It's similar to little round worms and stuff.\n\n\nThis\nguy has a very complex DNA structure, because he has a defense\nsystem; he has a head, he has a mouth, he probably excretes out here\nsomewhere, which is too much information -- but there he is.\n\n\nWhere\ndoes DNA come from? DNA is in space, it's everywhere. The DNA wave\nsays: Oh, this is the silica, the\nbasis of sand, I need to build little sea creatures in this stuff.\n\n\nJust\nlike when it's inside the nuclear reactor it says:\nOh, this is radioactive, I need to build radioactive bacteria in\nhere. Life is being created\neverywhere it goes.\n\n\nBut\nit even goes beyond that. Now, this really blew me away. Check this\nout: National Geographic, February 15, 2009, found identical species\nat the North and South Poles, but ONLY at the Poles. That's the only\nplace you find them.\n\n\nThey\ntried to explain it as maybe there are ships that go from the South\nPole to the North Pole. They analyzed every single ship in the world;\nnone of them do this at all.\n\n\nSo,\nthey found 235 different species that are identical at both Poles.\nThey were startled; they did not know what the heck was going on. This\nincludes whales, worms and crustaceans, very weird crustaceans, as\nyou are about to see.\n\n\nExactly\nwhere these species came from and how they ended up a world apart\nwith comparatively warm oceans in between remains a mystery. So they\ndo not know what the heck these guys are, how they got there. They\ndo not have any idea.\n\n\nWould\nyou like to see some of these creatures that emerged directly from\nthe consciousness field? let us go for it. they are very\nstrange-looking things.\n\n\nThis\nis called Limacina helicina.\nThis is very strange. It looks kind of like a snail but it's got\nthese fans on it like a squid. It's a very weird-looking thing.\n\n\nThis\nis called Clione limacina limacina,\nanother very strange-looking little creature.\n\n\nThis\none is Gaetanus brevispinus.\nThis is a crustacean of some kind.\n\n\nAnd\nlastly you have Mimonectes\nsphaericus. He's got a really\nnasty-looking defense system up front, does not he? He is a little\nbadass, but he's out there doing his thing and guess what created\nhim?\n\n\nThe\nconsciousness of the Earth spontaneously generates these little guys\nat both Poles. There is no conduit of sea water going from North to\nSouth Pole. He would have burned up on the way through the core.\n\n\nThink\nabout it. The reason why he's there is because the field generates\nhim, because he is supposed to be there, because the Earth makes him.\nThe Earth has made us.\n\n\nSo\nthe Solar System is creating evolution \u2013 DNA evolves by outside\nenergy.\n\n\n\nI am\ngoing to have to skip ahead through all this stuff, so just give me a\nsecond here. Ah, that's a good place to go because we are running out\nof time.\n\n\n\n[skips\nforward to slide that reads: Dr. Tszyan Kanchzhen: DNA Transformation\nby Wave.]\n\n\nSo\nwe have already seen now that you have DNA that has been created out of\nthe ether, same species at both Poles. you have seen the little guys\nthat grow in the test tube from nothing more than distilled water and\nsterilized sand. There's this little scum that grows on top and you\nlook at it under a microscope and \u2013 BOOM! \u2013 Here're these\nlittle critters.\n\n\nWhat\nabout DNA changing from one form to another? What about transforming\nDNA from one form to another, so that you have the given genetic\nmaterial of one species and it transforms into something else?\n\n\nWell,\nKanchzhen is the guy here, and there's a lot of different ways to\npronounce his name. Most recently I have seen it spelled Chiang.\nC-H-I-A-N-G is his first name. So, there's many different spellings\nof this guy's name, which makes it extremely difficult to find his\nwork online, unfortunately.\n\n\nSo\nwhat he does in this anatomically-correct diagram is he's got your\nduck over here, you can see the feathers, the head, quack, quack,\nquack, there he is. And over here you have a perfectly-described\nchicken -- obviously, I am being facetious.\n\n\nWhat\nyou have here is these little funnels that have been built into the\nsides of a little pentagonal box. He zaps this little duck with\nmicrowaves and all the microwaves go through these copper pipes from\none room to another. If you talk in here, you'll hear it in here;\nit's air that can pass through.\n\n\n\nHe's\nzapping it with microwaves, which are not going to kill the duck, it\njust kind of zaps his energy field enough to make it resonate, make\nthe DNA resonate. And over here, you have a chicken that has eggs in\nits womb.\n\n\n[slide:\npicture of white duck]\n\n\nNow,\nI want you to look at the physiology of a duck. Notice the long beak,\nthe webbed feet, the longer neck, the larger internal cavity of\norgans. Whereas a chicken, by comparison, - this is not what they\nlooked like when they came out by the way, that's just to fool you. I\nactually found this when I was looking for the picture of the chicken\nwith the webbed feet and then I found her with ducks and I am like,\nWow, is not that a synchronicity.\n\n\nSo anyway,\nlook: shorter beak, no webbing between the toes.\n\n\nThis\nis what actually hatched. These are called duck-hens. You see webbing\nbetween the toes, you see this strange-looking head. We can get a\nbetter look at it here. The eyes position is different. You get the\nduck-shaped head, the longer beak, the webbing between the toes.\n\n\nNow,\nhere's the stats. These add up to a total of 500 eggs; 480 of them\nhatched; 80% had a flat, duck-shaped head like you just saw; 90% had\nthe shift in the position of the eyes \u2013 90%! And 25% had\nwebbing appear between the toes.\n\n\n\nThis\nis a Chinese scientist who did this. It's an amazing piece of\nresearch. You go from this, and you blend it with this, and you get\nduck-hens that are half-and-half. It's an amazing phenomena.\n\n\nSo,\nif you have ever wondered what the heck is the duck-billed platypus?\nMaybe it just so happens that a bunch of ducks and a bunch of bulls\ngot together and did \"that which we cannot speak of in polite\ncompany\", and God got so angry he smote them with a lightning\nbolt. Then they had lots of little babies, and the babies are like,\nDaddy, Mommy. Oh, wow! What the hell\nam I? \n\n\nThat could\nhave been what happened, or maybe God just has a weird sense of\nhumor.\n\n\n[slide\nreads: Dr. Peter Gariaev - Astonishing DNA Wave Transformation]\n\n\nGariaev\nis where we get to the final point that's going to help round out the\nwhole talk: DNA transformation.\n\n\nYou\nhave frog eggs, okay? The frog eggs are laid and they are all sitting\nthere. Then you have a salamander's eggs, and you take a laser beam\nthat's not going to burn them, it's not going to kill them, it just\npicks up the wave information from the salamander. You take those\nsalamander eggs, you shine the wave through it, you redirect the wave\ninto the frog eggs. Guess what happens to the frog's eggs?\n\n\nYou get a\ncomplete metamorphosis. The genetic material of the frog's eggs\nbecomes cannibalized by the wave of the salamander. \"Cannibalized\"\nis maybe a strong word to use, but it gobbles up all the genetic\nmaterial that was going to make a frog and totally rewrites the code\nand transforms it into a salamander's body.\n\n\nIt happens\nin ONE generation. You have eggs that come out of a frog's body, and\nthey turn into a completely different species. That does not take very\nlong. It's instantaneous energetic change.\n\n\nSo\nwhat we are seeing is, this is the engine of evolution. This is what\nthe Solar System is doing to us. The Solar System's energy that's\ncausing all of the planets to charge up is the same as the energy of\nthe laser that goes through the salamander and shines into the frog,\ntransforms the frog eggs into salamander eggs, and they become\nhealthy adult salamanders.\n\n\nThey can\nbreed with each other. They do not get all these genetic problems when\nthey get older. They do not have the complications associated with\ngenetic cloning, of the genetic conundrum that you have with Dolly\nthe sheep, where like, the feet go bad as she gets older.\n\n\nSo,\nagain, I want to have you look once more at the fossil record, this\n26-million-year cycle. Why do you think it's happening in such\nregular intervals of 26 million years?\n\n\nThis\nis Raup and Sepkoski. Why do you think they found another cycle\nthat's 62 million years long? What do these zones actually represent?\n\n\nWell,\nhere's what we are going to talk about to cap off the whole talk for\nyou: Galactic bioenergy fields may be responsible.\n\n\nWe\nnow know, thanks to Dr. William Tifft, that even though most\nscientists associate red shift, which is just a microwave frequency \u2013\nthat's all it is, is microwave light \u2013 they associate red shift\nwith distance. Tifft has looked -- and his colleagues and people,\nwho have followed after him -- have looked at hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds of galaxies and every single galaxy that they look at has a\nstructure like this, okay?\n\n\n\nWhat\nyou are seeing here is, this is high intensity red shift, or high\nintensity microwaves, and then it goes lower and lower as you go out.\nSo these frequency changes are very regular; this is within a regular\ngalaxy now. What's happening is - you can see another example of it\nhere. These are red shift structures. You see the layers.\n\n\nWhat's\nhappening, we know from Dr. Rosine Lallement - and here's the link\ndown at the bottom, you can verify this:\n\n\n\nShe\nthinks this is only a coincidence, but what she sees is that the\nlocal interstellar medium, the clouds that are around our Solar\nSystem, are moving directly away from the center of the Galaxy. They\nare expanding away from the center of the Galaxy.\n\n\nSo,\nwhat we are seeing now is that these guys, these clouds in the Galaxy\nare going to be expanding away from the center in regular intervals,\njust like Lallement discovered. This appears to have the energy from\nthe Galaxy that reprograms all DNA and all life on Earth.\n\n\nNow\nI ask you this: If you have these 62-million-year cycles in the\nfossil record, if you have 26-million-year cycles in the fossil\nrecord, if you have these striated, evenly-different frequencies of\nmicrowave energy in the Galaxy, if Dr. Rosine Lallement has proven\nthat the clouds are flowing at us directly from the center of the\nGalaxy -- then do not you think, maybe, just maybe, interplanetary\nclimate change is being caused by Galactic energy fields, which are\nsqueezing in the heliosphere, making it 25% smaller, shooting in\nparticles to the Solar System, causing all of the planets to get\ncharged up, hotter, brighter, more magnetic, and that that energy\nactually has the DNA wave information to transform every living\nspecies on this planet into the next level?\n\n\nBecause,\nguess what? This is a 62-million-year cycle and the last time it\nfired up was 65 million years ago. This is probably off because of\nthe variations in the influx of solar radiation. we are at the end of\nthe cycle right now.\n\n\nNow\nthere's one thing that we are going to end with and that is the final\nproof that is going to make this all come together for you.\n\n\n[slide\nreads: Human Evolution is Dramatically Speeding Up]\n\n\nI\ncan prove to you that human evolution is already doing what we expect\nit would do, based on interplanetary climate change, based on the\nscience I have showed you. I have the scientific proof that you are\nactually evolving, genetically, based on this science. Check this\nout.\n\n\nJohn\nHawks, University of Wisconsin anthropologist, studied evolution in\nhuman beings \u2013 it\u2019s called positive selection. He found\nthat in the last 5,000 years, your DNA is upgrading a hundred times\nfaster than ever in human history. In fact, the last 40,000 years\nhave been a time of supercharged evolutionary change.\n\n\n\nWe\nare more genetically different from people 5,000 years ago... that's\n3,000 BC. That's the time of things like the time of Sumerians, and\nthat's the time of the Indian Hindu scriptures.\n\n\nWe\nnormally think of these people, the Old Testament and just a little\nbit after that, ancient Egypt, people building pyramids... we do not\nthink of them as much different than we are.\n\n\nBut\nif you compare those people that are building pyramids in Egypt to\nthe Neanderthals \u2013 Neanderthals, right? With the big clunky\nbrow? Nothing like mine; my brow has nothing like that. I am not a\nNeanderthal.\n\n\n\nHe\ncompared those people in Egypt with Neanderthals, and they are more\nsimilar to Neanderthals than they are to us. You do not think about it\nbecause we look around, we say: Yeah,\nthese are people. Everybody is the same, you know.\n\n\nBut\nlook, the genetic proof is already here. we have changed more in 5,000\nyears than ever in human history, and he's calling it supercharged.\nThis is an actual mainstream media proof of that.\n\n\n\nAnd\nhere's another one showing that our evolutionary fast lane is\nbecoming increasingly different at a hundred times faster in the last\n5,000 years.\n\n\nNow,\nhere's the last thing. Our average IQ has had to be increased by\nthree points a decade. It's been studied in over 20 different\ncountries, by Flynn, and it's continued for over a century. And our\nIQ is rising the most in abstract, nonverbal patterns, which means it\ndoes not have to do with us reading more magazines, newspapers and\nsurfing the Internet. It's a symbolic intelligence.\n\n\nSo\nthis is the hard-core proof, scientifically measurable, the reason\nwhy the IQ is going up like that, because a score of 100 is supposed\nto be average... that's how it's weighed. So in order to keep 100\naverage, you have to bump it up by three points every 100 years --\nbecause everybody's getting so much smarter, you got to keep knocking\ndown their IQ score.\n\n\nBecause\neverybody's average is now 100, that means everybody is so much\nsmarter, now your IQ is going to go down and down and down, which if\nyou have low self esteem, could really hurt you. So, do not hang out\nmuch longer, just, you know, psfaw. No, I am not saying you should\nkill yourself, of course, unless you are really, really arrogant about\nyour IQ.\n\n\nAnyway,\nthis is where we are going. It amounts to a cultural renaissance.\n\n\n\nSo,\nthe Galaxy \u2013 and this is the final point \u2013 20 years of\nstudy of ESP has proven, scientifically sound studies... He looked at\nall of these studies -- Spottiswoode his name is -- to see if people\nwere psychic when it's high noon or a certain time of the day. He\ndid not find anything in the normal day, which is where the Sun is\nrelative to the center of the Earth, but when the Earth's position\nrelative to the center of the Galaxy was studied, he found that when\nyou are aligned with the center of the Galaxy, your ESP ability goes\nup by 400%. This is a mainstream scientific study.\n\n\n\nSo\nthink about this. We now have the proof, and this is what I am going\nto end on, we now have the proof that galactic energy, as you see\nright here, he took 20 years\u2019 worth of studies into ESP, 20\nyears, and he found that people got more psychic when the galactic\nenergy field is hitting them.\n\n\nI have\nshowed you layers of fields in the Galaxy that are measurable on a\nsuperficial level by microwaves, just like near-infrared is showing\nup on the planet, same thing.\n\n\nI have\nshown you proof from Rosine Lallement that these galactic energy\nwaves are in fact expanding away from the center of the Galaxy as\nthey go out. It's not proof, but it's certainly circumstantial\nevidence that strongly leads in that direction.\n\n\nI am\nshowing you proof that the Solar System is changing, proof that the\nSun's heliosphere is shrinking, which suggests very strongly a\ngalactic causation.\n\n\nIf\nthe galactic energy can make you more intelligent, and if all the\nspecies on the Earth are being reprogrammed in their DNA in 62- and\n26-million-year cycles, and if we are at the end of another\n62-million-year cycle right now, then let us put our hands together,\nbecause we are awake and aware and we are walking into the New Age,\nmaybe in 2012.\n\n\nThank you\nso much.\n\n\n[applause/\novation]\n\n\nAll right,\nI got a standing O, baby, a standing O.\n\n\n[Bill Ryan\nand Kerry Cassidy go onstage to thank and embrace David Wilcock]\n\n\nI am glad\nyou liked it.\n\n\nKC:\n David, thank you.

Duncan\nwill tell you a little bit about this himself in the hour that he has\navailable. Duncan is the first generation of this particular\nprogram. Off-record we talked to Dr. Pete Peterson, and I have\ngot to be a little careful about this, but he talked about Duncan\nO\u2019Finioan being the first generation of this program. When\nwe say the\nfirst generation,\nwe are not talking about fathers and sons; we are talking\nabout leaps in technology. Like the first generation aircraft\nwas the Wright Brothers. The second generation aircraft was a Second\nWorld War early fighter jet. The third generation aircraft is the B-2\nBomber. The fourth generation aircraft are the things that officially\ndo not exist and which fly off in the secret space program. The\nSuper Soldier Program is now in its fourth generation and we were\ntold some details about this. KERRY CASSIDY (KC): At least.\nBR: And I am still trying... I am still trying to\nthink\u2026 \u201cAt least\u201d \u2013 I am just\nreporting.  you are saying \u201cat least\u201d.\nThat may be true. KC: No, it\u2019s just that we do not\nknow what generation for sure because we do not know, you know,\nthey have not let on... BR: I am just reporting\nwhat Dr. Pete Peterson told us. KC: Project Talent. But go\nahead. BR: Yeah.  So, what you are going to\nhear just now is the personal story of somebody who is well-described\nas a real-life Jason Bourne. He\u2019s trying to discover his\nidentity. He\u2019s trying to figure out who did this to him and\nwhy, and what happened, and what memories he still has to recover in\nthe process. There are still blanks. We are very privileged\nto count him as a personal friend. He\u2019s a man with a heart the\nsize of a planet. We love him to pieces and the best story here is\ntold from him in person. This is the important part of conferences\nlike this. When you are looking at a little video which is two\ninches by three inches on a computer screen, or reading a transcript,\nit\u2019s not the same as hearing the words spoken from the heart of\na man who has been so deeply affected by these programs. Duncan\nO\u2019Finioan, please come to the stage. [applause /\novation] KC: Okay. I want to say a couple of words before we\nget started. Duncan is a highly gifted psychic, among other things,\nand I do want to say that when Bill was talking about first\ngeneration and so on, actually, what we are talking about\u2026\nThe logical progression of that becomes robots \u2013 okay? \u2013\nbecomes things like The\nTerminator,\nbecomes things like human beings that are combined with machines, who\nhave limbs that have been enhanced. I am sure that\nDuncan can clarify this for you, but that\u2019s where we are\ngoing with this. So I just wanted to be a little more specific, not\nquite so general, so that you understood where we are going with\nthis. And there is no superficial relationship between some of the\nthings that Pete Peterson was involved in and we are not allowed to\ntalk about, and what those other levels of what Duncan was the first,\nif you will, the test case or the main test case, prototype, however\nyou want to put it, the human prototype for. Okay, so with\nthose leading comments, you can take that where you will \u2013\nDuncan O\u2019Finioan.  DUNCAN\nO\u2019FINIOAN (DO\u2019F):  Thank you. Well, I did not expect\nthis.  I thank everybody for showing up this morning,\nespecially Bill and Kerry and Project Camelot for letting me do this.\nI have no clue before I talk what I am going to say. I\njust walk up and let it come out. I\u2019ll start with, as Bill was\nalluding to... generations of this project is correct. This is,\nbasically, the fourth generation that we are in now. I\nwas first generation, 1960s. There was a previous generation in the\n1950\u2019s that was a failed experiment. So basically in my\ngeneration, they started the program all from new, all from scratch\nand we are right now, if my information is correct, in the\nfourth generation. What I\u2019d like to do tonight or this\nmorning... hey, I am still on East Coast time!  I\ndo not know what time it is. I want to try something different.\nI am going to try to stay away for the first twenty minutes or\nso from any scientific standpoint. What I\u2019d like\neveryone to do is take a couple of deep breaths, exhale it slowly,\nrelax yourselves. Yeah. I am going to try a little experiment of\nmy own and see how it goes. we are going to tell a\nlittle story. The story starts in the winter of 1966, and if anybody\nknows what eastern Kentucky looked like in 1966, well, you are\nbetter than I am, because I do not remember.  you are\ntalking two-lane roads, mostly gravel. Eastern Kentucky in the 1960\u2019s\nlooked like a throwback to the 1920\u2019s, and that\u2019s where\nI am from. Well, one winter afternoon I am loaded\nup in a truck by my parents and I am taken to a hardware store.\nIt\u2019s the only hardware store in the entire county, and in the\nback of that store is a room that has a hidden door. I had walked by\nthat wall with the door numerous times with my Dad and my Granddad;\ndid not know it was there. So, I was taken in by my Mom and\nwe went through the door and in this room was about eight to twelve\nother kids about my age; I was six years old. And they are all\nsitting at these little low kindergarten-type tables and they all\nhave puzzles and they are trying to put the puzzles together.\nNow, walking around the room is a lady of European descent,\nwith an extremely-heavy accent. She comes over to me and helps me\ntake my jacket off and sets me down and asks me if I\u2019d like to\nplay. I am six years old -- of course I want to play. She gives\nme some puzzle pieces and says: Make\na picture out of the pieces.\nWell, for years, since I have started regaining all my\nmemories, we had thought that the test itself was making the correct\npicture with the puzzle pieces. We do not believe that\u2019s\nso now. What we think it was now was... The lady\u2019s name was\nHelga. She was a transmitter. Audience Member (AM): Can you\ntalk just a little bit louder for us? [audience member continues but\nthe words are unintelligible, then audience laughs] DO\u2019F:\nOkay. She\u2019s a good friend of mine. I am going to allow it.\n What we believe now is that Helga was a sender, a\ntransmitter, a psychic transmitter, and the test was to see if I\nwould be a strong enough receiver, because as the project\ntransgressed through the years, we were mated up with another: one\nbeing the transmitter, one being the receiver, one being the spotter,\none being the shooter. And that\u2019s how we wound up being two-\nand three-person teams, sometimes five. Okay? But we were always\ntogether, psychic to soldier. Now, I am just going to\njump around a little bit because I have got an hour and I am\ngoing to assume most of you have seen the interview at one time or\nanother. Okay? Project Talent \u2013 The easiest way to\nexplain what Project Talent was\u2026 is basically, or was\nbasically, the taking of other peoples\u2019 talents and using it\nfor their own purposes. Each one of us taken into this project had a\nspecific talent which the government took, trained, increased,\nenhanced, and exploited. We were never supposed to regain our\nmemories but most... some of us have. In 1966 in the group\nthat I was in, there was 1,000 of us. There\u2019re less than 20\ntoday. Half did not survive. Now, the process\u2026\nWell first of all, how many knows what multiple personality disorder\nis? Yeah. That\u2019s about what I expected. What they did\nwith us is they split our personalities. This was artificially\ninduced and if you go look at one of the paintings on the back wall\nwhen you have a chance, you\u2019ll see a graphic description of\nwhat was done. The alternate personality is the one that was\ntrained in every martial art known to humankind. We were trained to\nfly every aircraft there was at that time. We were trained in every\naspect that you could think of, every art of war, every part of the\nmilitary there was. We were, in essence, a par\nelite\nof soldiers and we were used all around the world. A lot of our\nassignments were for termination. A good deal was for\nintelligence-gathering, but by and large we were assassins, pure and\nsimple, and someone needs to be held responsible for this. So\nwhere do we start? Who do we hold responsible now? I am 50 years\nold. The people who did this to us in my generation are probably long\ngone. However, the projects continue under different names, different\nguises; they still continue. So how do we stop it? Anybody? How do we\nstop it? AM: By people like you talking. DO\u2019F:\nI am just a loudmouth on a stage. AM: \nDO\u2019F: That\u2019s one. How about we turn ourselves\nagainst them?  DO\u2019F:\nWe were created to be a private army in the future. People ask me: If\nyou are exposing this, you went through all this, why are you\nstill alive?\nI am still alive for two reasons. I was part of a project; the\nproject has not ended. It\u2019s still ongoing. The reason\nmost of us are still alive is they hope to activate us one last time\nand be the protectors, the private army of the elite of this country.\nI am not going to do it and I do not know any of us\nthat will.  DO\u2019F: Now, what I am\ngoing to do with the rest of my time is kind of turn this over to the\naudience. You know, I do not have a whole lot new to talk about.\nI have pretty much done that. There\u2019s a lot of new things\nthat is still in the hypothesis stage... I never say anything as fact\nunless I have three points of reference and proof to back it up.\nSo, what I\u2019d like to do is turn this over to kind of a\nquasi Q&A, if you do not mind. So, if anybody has anything\nthat they would like me to add on to or to explain more, let us\ndo that for awhile. Yeah. She had her hand up before you.\n PC ASSISTANT:  Why do not we have\npeople queue up over here to save time? DO\u2019F: That\u2019s\nfine. Cool. Okay. AM 1: I know with your multiple personality\nthey have a way of triggering you, you know, changing you -- have you\nfound with any of the other people or with yourself, any way to be\nable to stop that? Whether it be, like\u2026 I know that we\nhave a third eye and a capital \u201cI\u201d. You know, some way\nthat you can fight back by not allowing it to be turned on? How would\nyou have control if they turned on something that you do not\nhave any control over? DO\u2019F: Well, what happened with\nme is I was in a car accident about twelve years ago and I had to\nhave an MRI done on my skull, and it did not like the chip or\nthe chip did not like it. So, it\u2019s not completely\ndeactivated, but it\u2019s been damaged enough. What\u2019s\ngoing on now for some of us is\u2026 this going to sound so\nunbelievable. Our alternate personalities are beginning to merge with\nour primary personalities. What were once two people are now becoming\none, and that is something that the Illuminati, the Elite, the\nBankers -- whatever title you want to put on them -- that is\nsomething that scares them to death, because the alternate\npersonalities are integrating our memories, our emotions that they\ncannot have. AM 2: You mentioned in the video that you\nhave some telekinetic abilities. Are you able to consciously control\nthese in this personality at this point? I\u2019d sure love to see a\ndemonstration!  And also, can you train other people\nin how to use some of the stuff you learned? DO\u2019F:\nYeah, the Amazing Randi [Ed note: James Randi is a world-renown\nsuper-skeptic of paranormal phenomena.] would like to see that too.\n Most of any psy abilities that I have are tied into the\nalternate personality. One of the reasons that I was a shooter is\nbecause I was best at being a soldier, not the psychic spy, not the\nremote viewer. I was one of the worst remote viewers in the world.\nYou know, I was more suited to be a physical, augmented soldier. AM\n3: Yeah, Hi Duncan. I have a book that\u2019s called Mind\nControl of America\nand I understand that you were programmed as a soldier. This book,\nthe topic of the book, is about women that were groomed from the time\nthey were very small to be basically sex slaves for a lot of people\nwho are in power. DO\u2019F: Project Monarch. AM 3:\nUsing dark ceremonies in order to control the, kind of the orgasmic\nenergy, into the darkness. I was just wondering, do you know about\nthis? DO\u2019F: Yeah, that\u2019s kundalini magic. That\nties in. A lot of these programs use ritualistic magic and it is dark\nmagic. So, yeah, I am aware of what you are talking about. AM\n3: Yeah, because she claims to have had sexual relationships with a\nlot of people in power throughout the years; her and a bunch of women\nthat, like you, are starting to remember and have shattered multiple\npersonalities, very similar stuff... \nDO\u2019F: Thank you. AM 4: Hello and thank you for\nbeing here. I read Ender\u2019s\nGame\nand I just want to know, have you read Ender\u2019s\nGame\nand, I guess, have they tried to take people off-planet to cover it\nup? And, like, how much of that is true or is it false? DO\u2019F:\nI did not quite understand. AM 4: Oh, have you ever read\nthe book Ender\u2019s\nGame\nby Orson Scott Card? DO\u2019F: No, I have not. I do not\nwatch movies. I do not read books.  I stay away from it\nas much as I can. AM 4: Because your story reminds me of\nEnder\u2019s\nGame.\nBasically Orson Scott Card writes about grooming a six-year-old to\nfight the alien invaders that will be coming in the future. But in\nEnder\u2019s\nGame,\nwhat happens is that, you know, the government wants to cover\neverything up and so they ultimately take people off-planet. So I was\njust wondering if you knew\u2026 DO\u2019F: I am\nfamiliar with what you are saying, but I really could not\nanswer anything. AM 4: Okay, great. Thank you. DO\u2019F:\nThank you. AM 5: I guess we have all got books that kind\nof relate to this and mine is TRANCE\nFormation of America. DO\u2019F:\nI am familiar. I am familiar with it, yeah. AM 5:\nIn that particular book, pedophilia was one of the means they used to\ncreate multiple personalities and I just wondered was pedophilia a\npart of your\u2026? DO\u2019F: I have no memory of sexual\nabuse. This is the reason I wanted to do the Q&A. Every question\nis leading me into the explanation  I was wanting to get into.\nMy alternate was instilled due to trauma-based torture. Okay? I was,\nover a period of time\u2026 What a lot of people think when\nthey see the previous interviews is that once I was taken from\nKentucky to wherever I went, this was done instantaneous over one\nday. No, this took place over weeks and months. All right? We\nstarted out with being strapped into a wooden chair, with the strobe\nlights, being talked to, slapped around. I learned what\nwater-boarding was by the time I was seven. Okay? Then they would\nstart with the needles under the fingernails. They would do one, then\na few days, maybe a week later, two. The purpose for this was to\nincrease the pain tolerance. Okay? They wanted us to have a\npain tolerance that was unbelievable, so that they could finally get\nto the point to where they could have all ten fingernails with\nneedles underneath and then an electric current being put through\nthem. Then I was given a drug so that I could not faint, I could not\nblack out. So at that point, your psyche has a choice to\nsplit off to an alternate personality or die. I split. Most of them\ndid not. Does that help? AM 6: I think you are very\nbrave to come to this sort of meeting... I would think you would be\nat risk. But anyway, you were mentioning that there were initially\n1,000 recruits. Now did all 1,000 go through the program or... you\nsaid there are only 20 remaining? DO\u2019F: It\u2019s my\nunderstanding that only 20 of us are remaining alive. The 1,000 that\nwere taken into the project in 1966 were the first-generation\naugmented individuals. They were from all over the world. I remember\nkids from Australia, England... when I say from all\nover the world,\nI am talking about the Allies, the Allied countries that we had\nat that time. I do know that the former Soviet Union was\nworking on a very similar program, as well as China was working on a\nsimilar program. There was one incident in my early 20s when I went\nup against one of my Soviet counterparts. I lost that one. AM\n7: How did your parents react to this? Did they have a problem with\nthat?  DO\u2019F: My parents? I am\ngoing to be diplomatic.  No, it\u2019s a good question, it\u2019s\nan excellent question. My father was in the CIA. That\u2019s how my\ninvolvement came about. This is a generational project. I have not\nspoken to my mother or my siblings in over 20 years and I have no\ndesire to. What do they think about this? \nThey would probably as soon see me in the ground right now, and\nthat\u2019s being diplomatic. AM 8: Duncan, I am very\nsympathetic with your state, the severe trauma that makes the\nmultiple personality disorder, and in fact, most of our soldiers who\ngo abroad and experience trauma experience something called Post\nTraumatic Stress Disorder. DO\u2019F: Right. AM 8:\nYou have a very severe case of that and I would like to suggest, if\nyou did not know about it, there are some very good mind/ body\nmedicine techniques that can be used to really release the trauma and\nemotions connected with the trauma that could possibly lead to a\nhealing. And when you said that you felt that the various\npersonalities were beginning to merge, actually I think that\u2019s\nthe mind/ body trying to heal. But I think the point is that\nyou want to get rid of the Traumatic Stress Disorder, so that you can\ngo back to being your whole self. So, if you want more information\nabout that, I may be able to help you. DO\u2019F: Sure.\nThank you. The problem with that, with the personalities merging?\nWhen that begins to take place, we really do not have a choice.\nWe either let the personalities merge together; we let the implanted\npersonality take control, which would not be a good thing; or we\nbecome one person kind of right down the middle with the original and\nthe augmented... something that at least has some emotions and some\nunderstanding of right and wrong. The alternate personality\nhas, at that time before they begin to merge, has no emotions. Right\nand wrong means nothing \u2013 okay? \u2013 simply follow orders.\nAM 9: Duncan, thank you for being here and sharing with us\ntoday. DO\u2019F: Thank you. AM 9: It\u2019s\nprobably been a couple of years since I have seen your interview.\nI was wondering if you could talk about the experience when you were\nin a team, I guess? You were youngsters... when you came in. I do not\nremember if you guys stood in a semi-circle or a full circle, but you\ntook out the enemy. Could you discuss your perspective on the\nenergetic mechanics of what was going on, how you did that, and\nperhaps some of the other phenomenon that might have been similar?\nDO\u2019F: Yeah... ah...  s-h-h-h.\ndo not tell anybody; we were in Cambodia. We were not\nsupposed to be in Cambodia during Vietnam \u2013 okay? \u2013 but\nwe were there. There are some people in this room that were there.\nAfter we are finished, if anybody wants to talk to them, I\u2019ll\nintroduce you. We were thrown in as part of a rescue\noperation. A couple of SEAL teams and OSS [Ed note: Office of\nStrategic Services] teams were pinned down by Khmer Rouge fire. The\nprocess by\u2026 ah... What we did, I really do not have an\nexplanation. But you are correct. We came out and we formed a\nsemi-circle facing the direction of the enemy fire, and we do have\nsome more information on that since we did the interview. There\nwere twelve of us. I was Team Leader. Consider: each of us as an\nindividual acted as a battery and we transferred all that energy into\nsomething else \u2013 it was a thirteenth person, but we do not\nknow who the thirteenth person was. The thirteen, again, being a\nritual number. The number of dead that day numbered in the\nhundreds. We then got back on the chopper and we flew off. AM\n9: I take it that that was also another aspect of the training that\none of the other personalities is schooled in. DO\u2019F:\nCorrect. Correct. Thanks. AM 10: Thank you, Duncan, for being\nhere. you are very brave. DO\u2019F: Thank you. AM\n10: I watched the video with Dave Corso and you seemed to have more\nmemory than he did. He does not seem to have the memories that\nyou do or... ... Was he in your program, or was he the\ngeneration that failed? DO\u2019F: No, Corso was not in my\nparticular project. He was in a different sub-project. Okay? Project\nTalent was not the only game in town with all this. There were a\ndozen sub-projects going on. For example, Project Talent fell\nunderneath the umbrella of MK Ultra, MK Ultra being a catchall phrase\nfor anything concerning mind control. There were 172\ndifferent sub-programs under MK Ultra \u2013 Project Talent being\none. Project Talent was where I began and then I was moved. As I said\na lot of times, Project Talent\u2019s like going to school \u2013\nokay? \u2013 and I was moved from Project Talent to the Ultimate\nWarrior Project, because I was more suited to be a physical soldier\nthan a mental/ psychic soldier.  To answer your question\nabout Dave Corso, Dave Corso began getting his memories right the\ntime he should, late 50s pushing 60, 61. That is when the blocks\nbegin to wear down and the memories start to come together. He got\nthem back right at the perfect time. I got my memories back\nbecause of an automobile accident. If I had not had the accident, I\ndo not think I\u2019d standing up here right now. I would\nprobably still be utilized and I would probably be in the Middle East\nright now. AM 10: You\u2019d still be working? DO\u2019F:\nI have no doubt that I would still be part of the program. AM\n10: Thank you. DO\u2019F: Yep. AM 11: Hi Duncan.\nDO\u2019F: Hi. AM 11: I grew up in eastern Kentucky,\nso I am very familiar with that area and the people that live\nthere. One of the interesting things about that area was that in the\n1500s and 1600s, a lot of the people that populate those mountains\nand areas were people from the British Isles and they were, I do not\nsay all, I\u2019d say some... ... were running from the\nlaw, so they populated those mountains and they were very closely\nknit and still are in the community. And my question to you is, can\nyou talk about\u2026 you mentioned that your grandfather was\n... Can you talk about that at all and how that affected\nyou? DO\u2019F: I had two grandfathers at that time. One\u2019s\nname was Bull. He was full-blooded Cherokee. The other was my\nfather\u2019s stepfather and I grew up more with my father\u2019s\nstepfather than I did ever\u2026 What county or what town were you\nfrom? AM 11: Ashland.  DO\u2019F:\nAshland? Okay, I know where you are from. Yeah, you are\nabsolutely right, during that time the mountains were littered with\npeople that bail bondsmen would love to have seen.  They\nprobably still are.  In all honesty, I have not been back\nthere in 17 years. It\u2019s been that long since I have been\nback and I seriously doubt if I will ever go back. Okay? AM\n12: Duncan, you talked about how the two personalities for those less\nthan 20 of you from your group who are still here are merging, these\npersonalities. DO\u2019F: Right. AM 12: And the\nPowers That Be are fearful of that. You said they do not want\nthat to happen. DO\u2019F: Right. Correct. AM 12:\nCan you just touch a little bit on that and why? What\u2019s causing\nthose two personalities at this time to merge? DO\u2019F:\nWhat\u2019s causing the merging? We have no clue and neither do they\nbecause it was not supposed to take place. What terrifies\nthem about the two personalities merging? My alternate\npersonalities... one of my alternates; I have four. Two of them, we\ndo not know how they got there. Okay? My primary alternate is\nknown as Omega Unit 197. He knows where all the bodies are buried. He\nhas all the knowledge, all the locations, the dates, the places, the\nbank accounts, etcetera. Imagine when we finally merge, I\u2019ll\nhave that knowledge in this personality. That better terrify\nthem because I will\nturn it against them.  KC: Hi there. I just want to\nsort of step in here and sort of help move things along here. Duncan,\nyou are doing a great job. There\u2019s some interesting energy\nin the room right now. Miriam Delicado are you in the audience? Is\nshe there? Okay, if she is, could she please come on stage? Thank\nyou. This is Dave Corso.  Bill, are you with us?\nThank you. Okay. DO\u2019F: I need a little break for a\nminute. KC: we are just going to give Duncan a little\nbreather here and I\u2019d like Dave Corso to say a few words to\nyou. Duncan does have more than one alternate and he is investigating\nthis very deeply. You have to understand that once somebody does\nthat, breaking down those walls makes them very vulnerable. And\nif you have seen the recent Terminator\nmovie, it\u2019s no lie \u2013 okay? \u2013 so just follow that\ncharacter\u2019s trajectory in trying to find out what was done to\nhim and watch his emotions and you\u2019ll have some clue as to\nwhat\u2019s going on here. Okay? So, if you have not seen the\nmovie, I encourage you to do so because it\u2019s really remarkable.\nDave Corso... DAVE CORSO (DC): Thank you. \n\n...to be where you are. KC:  Thank you. DC:\nLet me explain to you how I met Duncan in this iteration of life. We\nhad a mutual friend named John Morrow. John Morrow was the thirteenth\nmember of the team. When the helicopter landed in... [inaudible /\nbroken up; Duncan\u2019s voice being picked up by mic, overriding\nDave\u2019s voice] There\u2019s an energy that\u2019s\nworking in here now ... bring it on!  My team was\nsent to rescue another Special Forces-type team. We had some\nproblems. I called for backup. Well, about 10 minutes later, this\nCH-47 Chinook lands and these twelve kids get out... What the hell\nwas this? Bullets flying everywhere! There\u2019s this\nlittle kid with a big Afro, a white kid, that one right there.\n I said: What\nthe hell\u2019s this?\nBefore I could ask the question, these kids formed a circle,\njoined hands and there was a thunderclap and a flash of light like\nI have never seen. I looked at the helicopter as my vision comes\nback and there\u2019s a guy, and I said: I\ndo not know this guy; I do not even know what his uniform\nis.\nHe was an Officer in the Army, I think. To make a long story\nshort, they flew away, we got together our team that had come to\nrescue... and I asked the Master Sergeant: What\ndo you know? What do you recall?\nAnd he said: A\nblinding flash and the bullets stopped.\nThere were hundreds of Vietcong bodies as we wended our way back out,\nand we got to our chopper and we got out of there About two\nweeks later in Saigon, I ran across this Officer again and he had\nthis horrified look on his face. He had an insignia on his shoulder\nthat I had never seen before. Okay, that was 1967. let us\nfast-forward to 1992. I am in Pahrump, Nevada, in my computer\nshop and this guy walks through the door and my first instinct was to\nkill him. And I said: Why\ndo I feel that way?\nWell, as he introduced himself \u2013 his name was John\nMorrow \u2013 as he and I talked, I could sense there was something\nunusual about this gentleman. Well, John and I got to be good friends\nand one day after I had closed my shop... John was over because I was\ndoing some work on his computer.  I said: Let\nme tell you, John, what I first experienced with you. When you first\ncame in my shop\u2026\nI says: \u2026my\nfirst instinct was to kill you,\nand John Morrow\u2019s face got ashen-white. I said: I\nknow you from Vietnam.\nI said: When\nyou introduced Duncan and I in this iteration, you were surprised\nthat we knew each other and you were even more surprised that Sean\nand I knew each other.\nI said: You\ndid not expect that.\nHe said: No.\nHe gave me some more background on Dunc\u2019, because he\nwas one of Dunc\u2019s trainers. John Morrow was a very\nunassuming gentleman. When you looked at him, you\u2019d think what\na big teddy bear. John loved cats. John loved my dogs. John was my\nfriend, but he was a robot. There\u2019s a robot or two in\nhere today. I no longer sense their being a danger, but when I met\nDunc \u2013 and I am not telling the story about the yellow\nsnake, either  \u2013 that\u2019s a story for\nanother time, but you will not believe it and I did not...\nMy son\u2026 I have a son that\u2019s named David Thomas. He\nhas an unusual knack of... he\u2019ll ask me what I think are stupid\nquestions until I think about it. My nightmares started in\n1983 when my son and I are sitting in the little two-man rubber life\nraft fishing in Strawberry Lake in California. He looked at\nme and said: Daddy,\nI got a question for you.\nI said: What\u2019s\nthat?\nHe says: What\ndid you do in Vietnam? What did you really do? Because at times, man,\nyou just act really weird!\n(I said:  He\u2019s\nnine years old. What\u2019s he asking me what I did in Vietnam for?)\nI said: I\nthink I did... this.\nThat night, the nightmares started. Dunc and I have been\nthrough iterations of life together, as have Allison and I, and Laura\nand I. I am here to meet people, to tell you this: Whatever\nDuncan says, you can take it to the bank.\n DC: Dunc has other information that I\ndo not know if he\u2019s going to share today or not that I am\nprivy to. He talked about teams of three. Well, the third member is\nhere today. I am the anchor. Dunc\u2019s the soldier\nand we have the outlook, this iteration of \u201coutlook.\u201d\nThere are more than one. I am so grateful that I live in this\ncountry. I had an opportunity to go to work for the Russians after my\nterm was over in the US military. I looked at this guy and I said:\nWhat\nyou are going to give me? Make me a Major for six months, get my\ninformation and kill me?\nAs I turned to walk away, he was gone.  That quick. It\nhappened on a street in Oakland, California. You all have\ngood hearts and souls, but I have seen one thing, because my\ntalent is taking a mosaic and making a picture. A lot of you\nhave a lot of the pieces. We need to sit down as a group and not\ndesign a camel, which is a horse designed by committee, but sit as a\ngroup, bring out one truth. The truth stands by itself. And what is\nthe truth? Well, it\u2019s something that is politically acceptable\ntoday. It may not be politically acceptable tomorrow. Well,\nthe truth is this, relaying an event or situation exactly as it is\nwithout taking to or adding from that event to make someone right or\nsomebody wrong. Believe me, I know that\u2019s true. People say I am\ncrazy. Well, I am not crazy. It just happens you are not in\nmy normal realm.  I have wolves. I raised\nwolves and I have a wolf that lives in my house. He\u2019s a\npurebred wolf. DO\u2019F: I thought he was mine. DC:\n I have a wolf\nnamed Herk. Dunc and I made a 300-mile trip, about a 400-mile trip\none way. I took Herk with me because I felt so inspired. Now, this\nwolf was, what, four months old? He was four months old. He\ngot in the car just like it was normal. A hundred and fifty miles\ndown the road, he stands up and looks at Duncan, he looks at me and I\nsaid: I\nthink we\u2019d better stop.\nHe had to do his thing. He got back in the car. We drove on. We got\nto our destination and I thought to myself: This\nis a purebred wolf\u2026\nThis woman had two little dogs as I recall. DO\u2019F: Yeah,\nand a cat. DC: And a cat. My wolf got along fine with them.\n: Woof!\n DC: Thank you, boy, I appreciate that!\nDO\u2019F: You had to do it, did not you? DC:\nWell, I got a thing with dogs. Anyways, as we were coming home we\nstopped at a well-known sandwich shop. We got two burgers: two for\nDunc, two for me, and two for the \u201cdog\u201d. You know what?\nMy dog would not eat them. He buried them in the seat; I found\nthem the next day. So much for lovin\u2019 it, I guess. But\nI have had some amazing adventures with Dunc. Sitting in my living\nroom like it says in my interview\u2026 Now, stereo and things were\nturned off; it should not make a noise. Right? How about a loud\npop that hurts your ears? Have you ever experienced that? Electronics\ngo pop? It\u2019s a psychic attack. Audience: \nDC: Well, you were there, you should know. Either that or\nyour twin sister was there. I have a lot of fun with life. Things\nseem to be clearer in the here and now, and if they are not,\nbring it on... ... I am ready for ya. KC:\nThat\u2019s right. Okay, let us take a couple of the other\nquestions here. you have got two people and you can ask, either\none. Duncan has actually got a mic on him. Duncan, say a few words,\nso we can make sure it\u2019s working. AM 13: Okay. Hi, I am\njust wondering if we look x-ray photographs of your arm, your\nshoulder, and your head, would we see anything interesting in those?\nDO\u2019F: You would see metallic objects. I have x-rays and\nphotographs of the implant in my left hand; the cranial implant. I\ndo not have one of the shoulders, because I cannot seem to\nget my HMO to pay for it. AM 13: You think you could release\nthose online for us? DO\u2019F: Pardon? AM 13: Could\nyou release those photographs online for us? DO\u2019F: They\nare. AM 13: They are? Are they anywhere on your website?\nDO\u2019F: they are on my website, yeah. AM 13:\nThanks. DO\u2019F: Mm-hm. It\u2019s www.duncanofinioan.com.\nAM 13: If you could say that website one more time? DO\u2019F:\nwww.duncanofinioan.com.\nAM 14: First I just want to thank you both for being here\ntoday and for being courageous enough to speak with us and tell your\nstories. I do have a few questions. One is Project Talent. What were\nsome of the other talents that the children expressed and, if you\ncould, introduce us to some of them that are remaining today? DC:\nProject Talent, like Duncan said, is a far-reaching program. My\ntalent, among others, is taking a mosaic of little bits of\ninformation and giving you a very clear picture. That has been\nbrought home this weekend. There are people here that I was meant to\nmeet. There\u2019s three in the back room right now. I\nwas not taken for periods of time. I was taken for the summers.\nI was a summer school, so to speak. My training started when I was\nsix years old when my brother brought home \u2013 who happened to be\na Staff Sergeant in the Marine Corps at that time \u2013 brought\nhome a .22 target rifle. That was part of my training because he was\nalso in early Project Talent, as I found out later. But, I\nwould be gone in the summer, come home in time to go to school, and I\nhad all these memories of being with my Uncle Ed who was a peddler.\nGreat con-man. I asked my mother one time before she died, I\nsaid: Mom,\nI got a question for you.\nShe said: What?\nI said: I\nhave these memories of being with my Uncle Ed in the summertime,\ngoing out on the road. She\nsays: You\nwere never with Uncle Ed.\nI said: Then\nwhat did I do?\nShe said: When\nyou get older, you\u2019ll figure it out.\nAnd mother gave me that smile that said: you have\nasked enough questions.\nMother, God rest her soul, went Home in 1993. Before she\nwent, she showed me a journal she had kept of the time I was in the\nservice. Every time I got hurt, every time something significant\nhappened on a mission, she wrote down where I was, what I was doing,\nand where I got hurt and what the event was. I said: How\ndid you know this?\nAnd she said: I\nam your psychic anchor.\nI said: I\ndid not know that.\nShe said: There\u2019re\nlots you do not know yet.\nMy mother, God rest her, was an angel. Boy, could she be a\nholy terror.  I am different than Dunc. I do not\nhave any Native American blood in me that I know of. However, I say\nI am Sicilian, that\u2019s because my mother was Scotch-Irish.\nMy father was purebred Sicilian and I was raised by my grandparents.\nAnd it\u2019s interesting to know that when I was talking to\nthe third member of our team... Friday morning I am laying in\nbed at my niece\u2019s before I come over here, at 4:30 in the\nmorning and I said, Hey\nAllie, it\u2019s 4:30. Send a message to him,\nbut he never gets it. I ask Allie, I says: What\nhappened at 4:30 this morning?\nShe said I woke up out of a sound sleep and sat up and said:\nWhat\u2019s\nthis?\nPsychic abilities are alive and well. I am just finding\nout what mine are. I never thought to even question myself about it.\nWell, last night we were sitting in the cafe. Allie and I\nlooked at each other at the same time and\u2026 somebody was there.\nSomebody was there. There was a psychic vampire, was the second thing\nwe noticed. Robots do not know they are being used.\nThey do not know what training they have had. They have no\nknowledge, no memory, so we cannot hold it against them\npersonally. But understand, as many people as there are, are\ndifferent programs because everybody has different natural native\ntalents that have to be...ah... capitalized on. And I hope I have\nanswered your question. Am 14: Yes, you did and I have two\nmore, actually. DC: Go ahead. AM 14: You almost\nactually led into them. The second question is how can we locate,\ncommunicate with, the members of the subsequent programs, the next\ngenerations that they were talking about, and help them to understand\nwhat\u2019s going on with them? DO\u2019F: I do not\nthink you want to. We are the way we are without explanation. We\ndo not have one. As I said earlier, we were never supposed to\nretrieve our memories, at least not at this age. I helped Dave get\nhis back. I got mine back due to an automobile accident, so I woke up\nearly. The generation of people that are in this project\ntoday, which would be the fourth generation... Jeez! That is a very\nscary thought: To\ntry to locate one of these guys and communicate and try to reason\nwith that person, if they are in an alter .\nBR: We have some information about the fourth generation that\nI think, in the context of what you have told us, we should maybe\nsay a few words about. These soldiers are not human. They can\nsit in a doctor\u2019s surgery and pass the tests and the doctor\nwould not know if it was not an invasive test. Blood pressure\nreading, EEG, ECG; they pass the tests. They\u2019d be a healthy,\nstrong-looking, quite large, muscular-looking man. The person\nwho told us this once had a company, had a corporation, and the name\nof that corporation was Cyberdyne. Anyone seen the Terminator\nmovies? Okay. This is a reference to what we heard yesterday about\nhow the reality merges into the Hollywood movie industry as a way of,\nI believe, primarily as a way of disguising the truth, because when\nsomebody says: Hey,\nyou know, these stargates are real,\nthen they get laughed at because it was just something that came out\nof a movie script. This is how they hide things like that.\nCyberdyne is one of those examples. The person who told us\nthis, we pushed quite a lot. We had quite an interesting conversation\nabout it and we were given to understand that one of the many\nfunctions of these soldiers, for lack of a better word... of course\nthey can go into space without any problem at all. They do not\nneed to breathe. And the numbers of these soldiers, we were\ntold, were something in the region of 15,000. they have never\nbeen deployed in combat, we were told, because then their existence\nwould be revealed. But whoever the enemy is, and we are not sure\nin this context, they are given to believe that they exist, but\nthey have never been used. Now, that\u2019s pretty much\nall I know. I\u2019d like to ask Dave and Duncan here whether this\nfits with what you believe you understand. This is a conversation we\nhave not had. DC: It, of necessity, has to fit. I mean,\nBill gave an analogy with airplanes, on the generations. let us\ntake a better look, let us take a look at computers. In 1962\nwhen I was first introduced to computers, they\u2019d almost fill\nthis room. Yet I have one sitting on my desk. Well, I have six\ncomputers on my network at home. I happen to like to play with\ncomputers. That computer is three years old. It has more computing\npower than the first five computers they built that were the size of\nthis room. Every... it used to be every two years, then it\nwas every 18 months and now it\u2019s every year they double the\ncapacity and abilities of microprocessor chips. A microprocessor chip\nis about the size of a half-dollar. Used to be they had one computer\nchip system inside there, then there was two, now there\u2019s four.\nSame size chip. So his analogy that he wants is, what\u2019s\nthe fourth generation like? they are probably in fifth or sixth\ngeneration by now. That, to me, is absolutely terrifying and I am\nscared of damned few things in this world. And we are not\ntalking about the yellow snake either.  All right,\nI\u2019ll confess: I\nhate snakes.\n DO\u2019F: Listen, long and short: You do not\ncreate an army unless you intend to deploy\nthat army. This fourth generation Super Soldier / Warrior Soldier,\nwhatever you want to call it, are some bad people. I could not\nstop one. I was the best we had at my generation. I cannot stop one.\nThe possibility is very, very real they will be turned loose on the\nAmerican populace. What do you want to do about it? I want to stop\nit. If they turn this fourth generation loose on us, we are\ntoast. And they will try to reactivate each and every one of us in\nfirst, second, and third generation to join with them. If we\ndo not expose them now and try to at least put up a blockade, we\nwill not have a chance. They are that good. They are that strong.\nThey are that invincible. We have very, very little time in which to\npull this thing off. So what do you want to do about it? BR:\nJust a little data-point which I have just remembered... we were\ntold that two of these can pick up an Abrams tank. [laughter /\ncomments \u2013 inaudible] DO\u2019F: I can do a\n1,000-pound dead-lift at 49 years old and a broken neck. My neck was\nbroken in three places in my car accident. I was never supposed to\nlift anything heavier than a cup of coffee. I can dead-lift 1,000\npounds. That\u2019s first generation. What Bill just said about\nfourth generation\u2026 think about it. KC: I just want to\nadd that we have been told \u2013 Okay? \u2013 cannot say\nwhere our source came from, but that Duncan\u2019s quite right that\nthe American people, for one, are targets, could\nbe the targets of some of this army at some point in the future. We\nwere also told that a war is \u201canticipated\u201d, if you will;\none with China and two with visiting races, off-planet \u2013 okay?\n\u2013 and that these \u201cbeings\u201d that are being created\nactually have the capacity to handle that situation. And all of this\nis absolutely Top Secret, absolutely. The fact that Duncan is\ncoming forward and Dave Corso, and the fact that they found each\nother means that there is a power higher and more powerful than\nanything created by man. It\u2019s testimony to that, the fact that\nwe are finding each other. There are some other people in\nthis audience today that found us and found Dave Corso and Duncan and\nthey were involved as well. And they, some of them, do not even\nknow how deep yet. Okay? Some of those people were used, again,\nagainst their will. And I have to say that, you know, there\nare a lot of soldiers out there being used in very many different\nways that they do not realize. There are also people, sleepers,\nall around us that are being used even at night in their, if you want\nto call it, their light-body, being used, being trained, being\nutilized. So this is a very deep rabbit hole, so I just wanted to\nsort of paint that for you a bit. AM 15: What is a blockade?\nKC: Say that again. AM 15: What is a blockade? He\nmentioned we need a blockade. DC: What blockade? Blockade?\nKC: Blockade. DO\u2019F: Oh, no, no, no. I said\nthrow up a block, like playing football, to try to put a block up, so\nthat they cannot get to you. Information. We need as\nmany people to come forward as possible. We need you,\nanything an individual can do, even if it\u2019s as little as\nmentioning what\u2019s talked about here on a radio program. Even\u2026\nbe a call-in. Even as much as writing your Congressman. I know that\u2019s\na waste of time, but you can flood their offices. I know. I have\nwritten the President, okay? I get fan letters.  Whatever\nyou can do\u2026 because, people, this\nis a war,\nmake no mistake about it. And we are going to be fighting an enemy\nthat you cannot imagine. Okay? So we need help. We need your help.\nAM 16: Could we not just stop them by meditation? Is it not\npossible to change ...  ... by actually projecting it ...\n DO\u2019F: Right. AM 16: I mean, we as\npeople have no strength, but we have the strength of our thoughts.\nDO\u2019F: That\u2019s very true, absolutely very true and\nI appreciate everything you and others that I know in here that are\nworking right now. Okay? That\u2019s very true. But at the\nsame time, we need a physical presence, to show a physical presence\nthat We\nknow who you are, we know what your agenda is, we are going to\nstop you one way or another.\nAll the love and light works with it. They compliment each\nother. You cannot have one without the other. That\u2019s the\npoint that I was trying to make. And I do have a nasty habit of\nspeaking too fast because my brain works faster than my mouth and a\nlot of times it does not make sense. So you just have to tell me\nto shut up, say it again, slow down with it and go. AM 17:\nIt\u2019s my last question and after, I\u2019ll just offer one\npossible solution, but I am glad you mentioned that everyone has\ntalents. I was curious how the rest of everyone here as well as\naround the world can identify and develop their talents responsibly?\nDO\u2019F: It\u2019s generally widely accepted that\neveryone has a certain degree of PSI abilities. we are born with\nthat. If you are asking me how would you go about strengthening\nor enhancing that? First of all, stay away from anything that has\n\u201cProject\u201d on the beginning of it. [laughter from all and\napplause] KC: Except for Project Camelot, of course.\nAudience:  DO\u2019F: All right,\nmy mistake.  Find a teacher. Find a teacher, someone who is a\nwhite-lighter, a true white-lighter, and work with them. Let them\nteach you. AM 17: And then the possible solution... It was\nwith a conversation with Cynthia and another one of the guests, she\nsaid that similar to what this individual was talking about, if we\ncan send white light energy and love \u2013 call it prayer, call it\nwhat you will, to... you know, it\u2019s a radical idea\u2026\n\u2026but to the Illuminati and to leaders out there, so\nthat they can help to understand, really, what they are doing\nand so that they will have more love and actually change their minds\nto prevent unleashing such a Super Soldier force, as well as helping\nto shield them in the same energies that are shielding you, so that\nthe negative energies that are around them will not be able to be\naround them. DO\u2019F: You raise an excellent point, but,\nhowever, believe me, the Illuminati know exactly what they are\ndoing. To pick up on what you are running with: thought\nequals action.\nSo, as the lady here said with the positive thoughts \u2013\nabsolutely, you can manifest those positive thoughts into reality.\nWhat you are saying has merit and it possibly has a chance, but\nin the meantime, we need to have some type of preparation if it\ndoes not work.  AM 17: Absolutely. Thank you so much.\nKC: I want to say something here. What we are talking\nabout is awareness \u2013 okay? \u2013 being awake and being aware,\nknowing, becoming aware. Just the act of learning and becoming aware,\njust what we are doing right here, this creates the power. Okay?\nIt\u2019s not enough to just send blind light, blind love \u2013\nit must be intelligent. It must have perception attached. You must do\nmore than just give the heart. Okay? You must understand what you are\nseeing and why you are doing what you are doing. So,\nknowing and putting that piece together. That\u2019s the missing\npiece. And then, it\u2019s awareness. What you want to convey is the\nawareness of all the aspects of what\u2019s going on there. Okay?\nSo if you are loving, you are loving consciously,\nknowing all the parameters of what that means, not blindly. So do not\ngive your energy blindly. If you want to give your energy and power\nand light and love to the Illuminati, know what you are doing.\nBe conscious while you are doing it. MIRIAM DELICADO\n(MD): I want to tell you that, in that respect, there\u2019s\nsomething that I have done in the past in a particular situation\nwhere there were so many people involved, there were so many levels\nof understanding. I really sat and I meditated and asked my contacts:\nWhat\nis it that I can send to them?\nSo I sent one message: I asked for every individual involved\nto see the truth, to understand it, and accept it. Because the truth\nwill come from universal understanding and not only truth on the\nlevel of life here. So the truth would be that they are doing\nwrong and they would see it, they would understand it, and they would\naccept it, and then there is no choice. At that point comes change.\nSo send them, and send the world, that the world sees and\nunderstands and accepts the truth. Thank you.  KC:\nSo awareness is its best defense. That\u2019s your defense: total\nawareness. That means that when the Earth and all Humanity is an\nawake Being, one awake Being, then nothing can stop you. Okay? AM\n18: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for being here. Have either of\nyou tried hypnosis to try to fill in some of the blanks or merge the\npersonalities? I know it\u2019s probably a silly question, you\nprobably\u2026 DO\u2019F: Oh no, it\u2019s not a silly\nquestion at all. It\u2019s a logical assumption that we had done\nthat and the answer to the question is, yeah, I did, once, but I\ntried to kill the therapist. The alternate took over and tried to\nkill the therapist. AM 18: I was\ngoing to volunteer.  we will save that! DO\u2019F:\nThis is an idea that some of us have actually bounced around for a\ncouple of years, is that \u2013 if we can find a therapist who\u2019s\nwilling to do this \u2013 I would have to be chained to where I\ncould not move and then you can do what you do. And if... not\nif, but when the alternate is triggered, hopefully you\u2019d be\nsafe. AM 18: I am game. DO\u2019F: Okay, we will\ndefinitely talk about it. CYNTHIA CRAWFORD (CC):  I have a\nstatement that is going to be very profound for you. I have contact\nwith Beings from other worlds and I have my whole life. I have been\u2026\nthe government has tried to kill me because I am a product of a\nhybrid program they created. But recently when I was in\nLaughlin, I was blessed to meet a man who has been taken out of his\nbed against his will, forced on these ships and trained, and this\nincludes his family, trained to use alien technology to kill. And\nBarbara Lamb, as some of you know, did not know how to respond other\nthan: Did\nyou try using love and light on these beings to stop them?\nAnd the gentleman said: There\nis no amount of love and light to stop them.\nAnd he was brought to me and I said to him: If\nlove and light and all these religious different things people say,\n\u201cSend the power of the Christ energy to them,\u201d does not\nwork, perhaps they are of the light.\nAnd all of a sudden I was downloaded with information that\njust blew me away. I found out there is a number of thousands upon\nthousands of Sirian Warriors of Light that are on this planet now\nthat have the ability with the alien technology to protect the Light\nWorkers \u2013 not only to protect them, they will kill them [Ed\nnote: killing the Super Solders, that is.] if they have to. And they\nare designed to go up against the super-humans and you would not\nbelieve what they are doing. I have been shown the stargates,\nas I know you guys know about the stargates, what\u2019s going to\nhappen on the stargates. You know about that? DO\u2019F: I am\nnot touching that one. I do know about the stargates. CC:\nOkay. Well, I have been shown what\u2019s going to happen in the\nfuture. But I have to tell you, you have to trust in the Sirian\nWarriors of Light. They are here for a purpose. Many of them are just\nbeginning to wake up. They also have with them, besides the army\nthat\u2019s going to help fight against the super-humans, they also\nhave people, including a 13-year-old girl I met who can literally do\nhands-on healing and she\u2019s also Sirian. They are waking\nup. they are getting ready. they are preparing and they\nsaid there\u2019s an urgency now \u2013 now\n\u2013 to wake up. We all need to put our own light and love behind\nthem and with them, because we are going to have a hard job.\nIt\u2019s going to be very hard, but we can do it. Thank\nyou.  DO\u2019F: Thank you. AM 19: Hi.\nThank you for being here. My question... you mentioned yesterday on\nthe panel one of the positive things that you were doing kind of just\nfor the next year, you had mentioned music. But you had just\nmentioned that you do not watch television or anything like that\nor movies, and I understand that your training was probably\ntrauma-based, but there is music triggers as well. So I am just\ncurious, is there any music that you cannot... or if anything\nhas happened if you have listened to any music? DO\u2019F:\nWhat I was doing yesterday was using\u2026 I think what I said\nabout if the government controls alien ET Disclosure, I do not\nlike the music at that party. I was just using that as a comic\nreference. But to answer your question fully, no, I watch very little\nTV. As far as music goes, I stick with classical. I like Celtic\nmusic. That\u2019s about it. AM 19: Okay, thank you. AM\n20: Duncan, in light of the purpose in the whole way that Camelot\nworks, which is to expose and to be protected by exposure of truth,\nhave you guys thought about doing everything you could to get actual\nmemories with dates, times, who was killed, where they were killed\nand a list of it that would fully expose the program and could have\na\u2026 Yeah. DO\u2019F: That, in some respects, would\ndefinitely help to expose, but it would not entirely expose.\nWhat we have been doing is basically putting a call out for anyone\nwho is involved with these projects to get in touch with us. And\nas I have made reference to with people over this weekend \u2013 my\ngroup. That\u2019s my group. we are all past unwilling\nparticipants in one project or another with this. So, we are\ntrying to come together and by coming together and talking and\nputting all this\u2026 that\u2019s how we are getting the\ndates, the places and everything combined. What a lot of\npeople have to understand is that they may remember an event at one\ntime. I\u2019ll remember the exact same event with a different date.\nThen we will have someone else who was also part of this exact\nsame event, but they remember it at an entirely different date. And\nthat is done because when the memory is repressed into the altered\npersonality, you are told it happened this date. AM 20:\nBut if you could check it against the actual record\u2026 DO\u2019F:\nAnd that\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s why I said earlier, I do not\ntalk about anything as fact unless I have three points of reference\nin fact. AM 20:  I do the same thing. Well, it seems\nto me people coming up and saying I\nwas this part of the program\nwithout being able to show what was done will bring people more into\nthe awareness for this exposure. DC: I have a question for\nyou. What\u2019s your memory of what happened two hours ago? AM\n20: Very good DC: Are you sure? AM 20: Yeah. DC:\nIt\u2019s different than mine is. AM 20: Yeah. I understand.\nDC: But does it make yours any the less true? AM 20:\nThere is a physical... DC: Does it make your memory of what\nhappened two hours ago any less true than what mine is? Yes or not?\nAM 20: I am not talking about our memories. I am\ntalking about checking it against the physical universe. DC:\nI am going to give you an example here, if you\u2019ll just\nbear with me. Yes or no? Does it change your perception of what\nhappened two hours ago? Yes or no. AM 20: I, actually,\nwould not judge my perception that way. I would judge it by\nchecking it... DC: You have not answered my question. AM\n20: All right.  DC: The question is this: What\nhappened two hours ago, in your perception of what the world is and\nmy perception of what the world is, are they the same? AM 20:\nNo, they are not. DC: By your admission, does that make\nyours any the less valid? AM 20: It does not make either\none valid or invalid to me. DC: Thank you. You have answered\nyour question. DO\u2019F: The fact is, basically what\nhappens, it also a lot depends on the age of the individual when the\nmemory comes back. And, as I said, they also screw with the memories\nwhen they repress them and push them back into the alternate and they\nwill in that memory screw up the dates. AM 20: Right. Right.\nDO\u2019F: Now, as to what you were alluding to also is just\nbecause someone contacts us and says I\nwas in part of this project or this project,\ndoes that make it so? No, it does not. They have to go through\nour own little testing process to see if they were or they were not.\nBut to finish up with why we have the different perceptions\non dates, we really do not have a correct answer, but there\u2019ll\nbe a dozen of us; we will remember the exact same event, the\nexact same people there, but I\u2019ll remember it say, spring;\nhe\u2019ll remember it, say the winter, but yet the event\u2019s\nthe same. The year will be different. The month will be different.\nAM 20: I understand. It just seemed to me that checking it\nagainst a historical record that is in public domain would have some\neffect. DO\u2019F: I have got to do this. The problem\nwith that is there\u2019s a reason these are called black\noperations.\n They ain\u2019t supposed to happen. There are records,\nbut none that we are going to be able to take and look at, so we\ncannot do that. KC: There\u2019s also time travel\ninvolved here. And there\u2019s messing with... there\u2019s\nimplanted memories, false memories, false dates. There are layers\nupon layers, so, you know, digging into this question is... to\nactually look for real life events, it\u2019s a rabbit hole. There\nare so many levels, based on what we have heard from various\npeople. That includes the testimony of \u2018Henry Deacon\u2019,\nArthur Neumann. Okay? There\u2019s also something on the\nInternet, Stephanie Relfe, who interviewed her husband ,\ncalled The\nMars Records.\nVery interesting. She used some Scientology techniques, as well as\nsome other healing techniques to get to the root of some of his\nmemories. A lot of what he did happened on other timelines\nsimultaneously when he was other places. I mean, it gives you a\nbeginning of an understanding, how the layers can happen. We\nactually\u2026 this is fascinating and this has been amazing.\nThank you, both, Duncan O\u2019Finioan and Dave Corso.\n KC: And\u2026 Yes, absolutely. DC: If I\ncould have your attention for one minute. How many of you have ever\ngot a phone call, you picked up the phone and there was nobody there?\nHow many of you use caller ID to screen your calls? Let me\ntell you a little adventure I had. I had a phone call. It looked like\nmy son was calling me. However, when I picked up the phone, there\nwere tones coming out of the earpiece on the phone. It was not\nmy son calling me. They can manipulate caller ID to give you any\nnumber they want. If you pick up the phone and you hear\nsomething funny, or you think you hear something funny, hang the\nphone up. That\u2019s a very common way to initiate\ntriggers. Just be warned when you are called, make sure you feel\ncomfortable answering the phone call. If I get a call from an\nunknown number or an 800 number of a blank number, I simply do not\nanswer the phone.  Yeah, I\nhave to say, you guys are being mind-controlled \u2013 okay? \u2013\nyour televisions, you name it, the technical devices around you,\nscalar weaponry. It\u2019s not just these two guys. Okay? It\u2019s\nhappening to all of us. You must become aware in order to\nresist it, so you need to know that these things, telephone calls,\ntelevision programs, various anomalous events that happen in your\nmidst, pulses sent through stereo equipment. Actually wild\nthings, we have had some things happen up here with some of this\nequipment. Same thing. Thank you very much for being here for\nthis. Thank you so much for coming.  \n \n\n\n\u00a0"
