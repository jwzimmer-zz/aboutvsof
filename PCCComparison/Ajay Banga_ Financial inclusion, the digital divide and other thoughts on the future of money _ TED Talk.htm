											Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Ajay Banga,
thank you so much for being with us today.
											I feel like this conversation
is especially meaningful
											as we&#39;re wading through
this pandemic, it&#39;s late 2020,
											and we&#39;ve seen the way that inequalities
have presented themselves
											throughout this year, through this crisis.
											And since you&#39;ve been
at the helm of Mastercard,
											you have championed this idea
of financial inclusion.
											And so, could you start
by telling us a little bit
											about financial inclusion,
											what is it
											and why do you think this is something
that can change people&#39;s lives?

									<p>
											Ajay Banga: Yes, look,
I think that the COVID-19 crisis
											has actually made things
worse in some ways
											and some of the advances
that were being made
											over the prior decade
											on fighting poverty and fighting exclusion
											have probably got set back a little bit,
											just by the nature of the manner
											in which the virus has impacted

											But I guess if you pull back
from the crisis,
											because financial inclusion or exclusion
											is an underlying social problem
that dates back to well before this.
											The real issue,
here&#39;s the theory of the case.
											Of seven billion people in the world,
											close to two billion are either
underbanked or unbanked in some way.
											And what I mean
by underbanked or unbanked —
											unbanked is obvious,
											they don&#39;t have a relationship
with a banking institution of any type.
											Of any type.
											Now, underbanked is, even if they do,
											they&#39;re not getting to participate
in the financial mainstream
											and do things that you and I
take for granted,
											which means being able to access credit
											when you need it, at a reasonable price,
											being able to access insurance
											of the type that&#39;s relevant to you,
											being able to do things of that nature,
											save for a rainy day in the right way.
											All that done in a form
that&#39;s good for you as the consumer.
											That&#39;s underbanked.

									<p>
											And so, a couple of billion
people around the world,
											this is World Bank statistics,
											are basically unbanked or underbanked,
											and most of those people
											do not have a formal identity
											that they had received
or got from their government
											and therefore, there&#39;s nothing
they can take and hold out
											to show when they go to hire a car
											or live in a hotel
											or take a flight, which they don&#39;t do,
											to show that they exist in the system.
											Their opinions don&#39;t count,
											they don&#39;t get counted
in censuses very often,
											they don&#39;t get counted for their opinion
of what government should be doing,
											they get left out, they&#39;re locked out.

											And the last part of that puzzle

a bunch of shoulders at the wheel

											So if you&#39;re a farmer
											and you&#39;ve got to go to sell
your produce when it&#39;s harvested,
											you&#39;ve got to go two days&#39; way
to the nearest village market,
											well then, everybody knows
that on the way back you&#39;re carrying cash
											from the produce you sold.
											That normally leads to bad outcomes.
											Also, you&#39;ve got to go buy fertilizer.
											Or you&#39;ve got to go
back and forth to do all this
											and you&#39;re really unproductive,
											or you send your spouse to do it.
											All that changes if I can connect you

and cooperatives,
											give you cropping information,
											rainfall information,
											enable you to sell your produce
in a better marketplace, online,
											receive the money into an account online,

that farmer&#39;s cooperatives,
											local governments,

can help facilitate,
											in Africa, we&#39;re doing it in India,

											So the same example, another one,
											is for small and microbusinesses.
											Take a woman in Kenya
or in India or in Mexico in a village
											who opens a small shop outside her home
											when her husband and children are away.
											And it runs for a few hours in a day,
											and she stocks a little baby food,
and soap and toilet paper
											and whatever else people buy there.
											Well when the company van comes,
											the Nestle van, the Unilever van,
the local Bimbo Bread van,
											comes to sell produce to her
											on a Monday or a Tuesday
or a Wednesday at a certain time,
											she buys what she can in cash.
											Typically, she&#39;s in the cash economy,
nobody’s given her credit,
											she runs out of cash
for that produce that she&#39;s buying
											before the week is over.
											She&#39;s out of stock. She loses sales.
											Imagine if she could then be underwritten,
											digitizing that supply chain,
											what she bought, what she sold,
											underwrite her in a bank
											with actual transaction history,
											you could lend her the 500 dollars

											AB: There are two topics
you just came across,
											the digital divide,
which I think is a real issue.
											But just to be clear,
all the examples I gave you,
											they work on smartphones
and they work on old flip phones as well.
											That QR code, if you have
a camera on your smartphone,
											you can take it,
											but there&#39;s a numerical number there,
											you could enter that number
into your finger phone
											and get it across as well.
											Examples like that in Egypt,
											where we&#39;ve opened
mobile wallets on phones,
											they don&#39;t have to be on a smartphone,
											it could be on an old phone.
											So to be clear, these financial
inclusion examples
											do not depend on smartphones,
											they do not depend on just
internet access in your house,
											you do need a phone, a cell phone,
											in a number of the examples I gave you.
											But in the case of the micro
and small credit enterprises,
											you don&#39;t even need a phone.
											That actually is just
the transaction history
											of the produce you bought
and what you sold getting digitized
											and a bank being able to underwrite.
											There are other problems
of infrastructure in those
											that we can talk about.

											But to be specific
about the digital divide,
											I think that&#39;s another real big issue
											and again, COVID-19
has actually, unfortunately,
											exposed what was already
sort of an issue in society.
											So whether it&#39;s rural parts of America,
											let alone an African or Indian
or Indonesian or Guatemalan example,
											in America, in rural parts of America,
											broadband access is a problem.
											Disadvantaged children in New York City,
											who may not have access
to the same bandwidth capacity
											or computers that they need
to be able to participate in education,
											that&#39;s a problem.
											And so, that&#39;s a separate issue, Whitney,
											from the issue of some
of the examples I gave you,
											which I think can actually
be operated equally well
											with old-fashioned phones.

											AB: So I think a phone is transformational
											and the fact is that there are many
people in the world with a phone,
											but there&#39;s still a billion people
											who do not have the right kind
of phone or internet access.
											That&#39;s a different topic.
											So that said, you&#39;ve got to find ways
to reach them too.
											You can&#39;t only do it by phone.
											So the example of those micro SMEs
I was talking about,
											they&#39;ve got nothing to do with a phone.
											Or for example, in South Africa,
											with the social security administration
											where the government gives them
a certain amount of money every year
											for their being not employed,
											you can actually reach them
through a biometric card,
											which is what we&#39;ve done,
											with the government,
the government collects your identity,
											your biometrics on a card,
											and we can load the card remotely
											with the amount they want to transfer,
											take out the middleman in the process,
											and allow that person
											to then use that card to go to an ATM
to take out their cash,
											or go straight to a shop to shop.
											And I think that changes everything.
											So we&#39;ve done that in many countries.

											And so if you go to where Syrian refugees
were coming in to Lebanon
											and Greece and the like,
											every aid agency there
											would require them
to have an identity with them

they were dispersing.
											One of the things we&#39;re doing
is to convert that
											into a very simple
biometric-enabled identity
											which will be read across aid agencies,
											so you or I don&#39;t need to get
our identity verified

											There is a statistic in the world
that 40 percent of the dollars
											that governments want to spend
to reach their citizenry
											for social benefit programs
											never reach them.
											They are called leakage.
											Leakage means administrative costs
											and I call it theft.
											Because it&#39;s 40 less cents on a dollar

											The World Food Programme distributes food
											in those very refugee camps.
											And we actually help them
to take the food,
											they would buy grain somewhere
and ship it across,
											and lose some of it along the way,
											we put the dollar value on a card,
											the card can only be used by the refugee
											in a shop that the World
Food Programme certifies.
											So it cannot be used for anything
											other than what the World
Food Programme wants it used for,

around data and privacy
											and you&#39;ve said in the past
											that there&#39;s really an importance
behind putting consumers in control
											of their own data and their own privacy.
											How is that something
that we can actually achieve,
											what does it look like to do that?

											AB: Whitney, it&#39;s a terrific question.
											I actually believe that it&#39;s at the core
											of a lot to do with the next
10, 20 years of technology,
											the internet of things, 5G, data,
											this is all coming together
at warp speed, right?
											If you think about the number of devices
that are going to be connected
											over the next five, ten years,
and what 5G could do
											to moving intelligent computing
to the edge right near you,
											this is going to generate
enormous amounts of data.
											From your fridge, from your car,
											from you walking around,
from your connected glasses,
											from your watch already, all that.
											From your shoes if you&#39;re a runner.
											So you&#39;ve got to get to a stage
where we take a responsibility
											of how your data is used and interpreted.

									<p>
											And so, Mastercard,
											we with a bunch of companies,
											we have laid out a set of data principles.
											The first one is exactly what you said.
											It&#39;s your data, you should control it.
											Meaning you should know
what&#39;s being collected,
											you should be able to say,
&quot;I don&#39;t want that to be collected,&quot;
											in simple language,
											not in a 12-page legal agreement
that you cannot comprehend.
											And you should be able to benefit
from that data of yours that is used,
											either directly, or indirectly
in some way that you comprehend.
											And if I as a company
am collecting your data
											to enable me to do business with you,
											I should collect the minimum amount I need
											to do my job with you
											and I should keep
whatever I collect safe for you,
											and allow it to be deducted
or removed when you want it.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											These are not complicated things.
											Your data, you&#39;re in control,
											you should be able
to delete it when you want,
											you should know what&#39;s being collected.
											If I do anything with you,
collect the minimum, keep it safe.
											Consumers will vote
with their feet on this topic.
											As they get more knowledgeable,
											as they get more educated,
											and that&#39;s the right thing to do,
											they need to say, &quot;I don&#39;t want you
to use my data for the following things.
											I want to know what it&#39;s being used for.&quot;
											Putting consumer back
in control of their data
											is going to be mission critical
in the data-driven economy
											of the next 10, 20 years.
