share a couple with you today my first app was a unique\nfortune teller called \"earth fortune\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat would display\ndifferent colors of earth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepending on what your fortune was my favorite and most successful app\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis \"bustin jieber which is \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich is a justin bieber whack-a-mole i created it because\na lot of people at school\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisliked justin bieber a little bit so i decided to make the app so i went to work programming it and i released it\njust before the holidays in 2010 a lot of people ask me how did i make these a lot of times it is because\nthe person who asked the question\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twants to make an app also a lot of kids these days\nlike to play games but now they want to make them and it is difficult because not many kids know where to go\nto find out how to make a program i mean for soccer you could go to a soccer team for violin you could get\nlessons for a violin but what if you want to make an app and the kid's parents might have done\nsome of these things when they were young but not many parents have written apps where do you go to find out\nhow to make an app well this is how i approached it this is what i did first of all i have been programming\nin multiple other programming languages\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto get the basics down such as python c java etc and then apple released the iphone and with it the iphone\nsoftware development kit and the software development kit\nis a suite of tools\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor creating and programming\nan iphone app this opened up a whole new world\nof possibilities for me and after playing with the software\ndevelopment kit a little bit i made a couple of apps i made some test apps one of them happened to be\n\"earth fortune and i was ready to put\n\"earth fortune\" on the app store and so i persuaded my parents\nto pay the 99 dollar fee\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be able to put my apps\non the app store they agreed and now i have\napps on the app store i have gotten a lot of interest\nand encouragement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom my family friends teachers\nand even people at the apple store and that is been a huge help to me i have gotten a lot\nof inspiration from steve jobs and i have started an app club at school and a teacher at my school\nis kindly sponsoring my app club any student at my school can come\nand learn how to design an app this is so i can share\nmy experiences with others there is these programs\ncalled the ipad pilot program and some districts have them i am fortunate enough to be part of one a big challenge is how should the ipads be used and what apps should we put on the ipads so we are getting feedback\nfrom teachers at the school\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto see what kind of apps they had like when we design the app and we sell it it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall the money from that will go\ninto the local ed foundations these days students usually know\na little bit more than teachers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the technology so \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsorry so this is a resource to teachers and educators should recognize\nthis resource and make good use of it i had like to finish up by saying\nwhat i had like to do in the future first of all i had like to create\nmore apps more games i am working with a third party\ncompany to make an app i had like to get into android\nprogramming and development and i had like to continue my app club and find other ways for students\nto share knowledge with others thank you  when i was seven years old\nand my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed i was two years older\nthan my sister at the time \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti mean i am two years\nolder than her now \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut at the time it meant she had to do\neverything that i wanted to do and i wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds and on one side of the bunk bed i had put out all of my g.i joe\nsoldiers and weaponry and on the other side were\nall my sister's my little ponies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tready for a cavalry charge there are differing accounts\nof what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not\nhere with us today let me tell you the true story \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich is my sister's a little\non the clumsy side somehow without any help or push\nfrom her older brother at all amy disappeared\noff of the top of the bunk bed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand landed with this crash on the floor i nervously peered\nover the side of the bed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto see what had befallen my fallen sister\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand saw that she had landed\npainfully on her hands and knees\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton all fours on the ground i was nervous because\nmy parents had charged me\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith making sure that my sister and i\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplayed as safely\nand as quietly as possible and seeing as how i had\naccidentally broken amy's arm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjust one week before \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theroically pushing her out of the way\nof an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which i have yet to be thanked i was trying as hard as i could \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshe did not even see it coming \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti was trying hard\nto be on my best behavior and i saw my sister's face this wail of pain\nand suffering and surprise\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthreatening to

brain\ncould think to do to avert this tragedy and if you have children you have seen this hundreds of times i said amy wait do not cry did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that amy i think this means you are a unicorn now that was cheating because there was nothing\nshe would want more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan not to be amy\nthe hurt five year-old little sister but amy the special unicorn of course this option\nwas open to her brain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat no point in the past and you could see how my poor manipulated sister faced conflict as her little brain attempted\nto devote resources\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto feeling the pain and suffering\nand surprise she just experienced or contemplating her new-found\nidentity as a unicorn and the latter won instead of crying or ceasing our play instead of waking my parents with all the negative consequences for me a smile spread across her face\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand she scrambled back up\nonto the

we stumbled across\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat this tender age\nof just five and seven \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe had no idea at the time \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas was going be at the vanguard\nof a scientific revolution\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toccurring two decades later in the way\nthat we look at the human brain we had stumbled across\nsomething called positive psychology which is the reason i am here today\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the reason that i wake up\nevery morning when i started talking about this research\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toutside of academia with companies and schools the first thing they said to never do\nis to start with a graph the first thing i want to do\nis start with a graph this graph looks boring but it is the reason i get excited\nand wake up every morning and this graph does not even mean\nanything it is fake data what we found is \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif i got this data studying you i would be thrilled because there is a trend there and that means that i can get published which is all that really matters there is one weird red dot\nabove the curve there is one weirdo in the room \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti know who you are i saw you earlier \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is no problem that is no problem as most of you know because i can just delete that dot i can delete that dot because\nthat is clearly a measurement error and we know that is a measurement error\nbecause it is messing up my data so one of the first things we teach people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin economics statistics business and psychology courses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers\nso we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic\nif i am trying to find out\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thow many advil the average\nperson should be taking \u00e2\u0080\u0094 two but if i am interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity\nor energy or creativity we are creating the cult\nof the average with science if i asked a question like how fast can a child learn\nhow to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"how fast does the average child\nlearn how to read in that classroom and we tailor the class\ntowards the average if you fall below the average then psychologists get thrilled because that means you are\ndepressed or have a disorder or hopefully both we are hoping for both\nbecause our business model is if you come into a therapy\nsession with one problem we want to make sure you\nleave knowing you have ten so you keep coming back we will go back into your\nchildhood if necessary but eventually we want\nto make you normal again but normal is merely average and positive psychology posits\nthat if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average then instead of deleting\nthose positive outliers what i intentionally do is come\ninto a population like this one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand say why why are some of you high above the curve\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin terms of intellectual athletic musical ability creativity energy levels resiliency in the face\nof challenge sense of humor whatever it is instead of deleting\nyou what i want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move\npeople up to the average but move the entire average up\nin our companies and schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis on the news the majority\nof the information is not positive in fact it is negative most of it is about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is the accurate ratio\nof negative to positive in the world this creates\n\"the medical school syndrome during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all\nthe symptoms and diseases suddenly you realize you have all of them i have a brother in-law named bobo which is a whole other story bobo married amy the unicorn bobo called me on the phone \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom yale medical school and bobo said shawn i have leprosy which even at yale is extraordinarily rare but i had no idea how to console poor bobo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he had just gotten\nover an entire week of menopause we are finding it is not necessarily\nthe reality that shapes us but the lens through which your brain\nviews the world that shapes your reality and if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational\nand business outcome at the same time i applied to harvard on a dare i did not expect to get in and my family\nhad no money for college when i got a military scholarship\ntwo weeks later they let me go something that was not\neven a possibility became a reality i assumed everyone there\nwould see it as a privilege as well that they had be excited to be there even in a classroom\nfull of people smarter than you i felt you had be happy just to be\nin that classroom but what i found is while some people experience that when i graduated after my four years\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand then spent the next eight years\nliving in the dorms with the students \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tharvard asked me to i was not that guy i was an officer to counsel students\nthrough the difficult four years and in my research and my teaching i found that these students no matter how happy they were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith their original success\nof getting into the school two weeks later their brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or physics but on the competition the workload the hassles stresses complaints when i first went in there i walked\ninto the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from waco texas which is where i grew up \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti know some of you know this when they had visit they had look around and say this dining hall looks like\nsomething out of hogwart's it does because that was hogwart's\nand that is harvard and when they see this they say why do you waste your time\nstudying happiness at harvard what does a harvard student\npossibly have to be unhappy about embedded within that question\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis the key to understanding\nthe science of happiness because what that question assumes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis that our external world\nis predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if i know everything\nabout your external world i can only predict 10%\nof your long-term happiness 90 percent of your long-term happiness\nis predicted not by the external world but by the way your brain\nprocesses the world and if we change it if we change our formula\nfor happiness and success we can change the way\nthat we can then affect reality what we found is that only 25%\nof job successes are predicted by iq 75 percent of job successes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare predicted by your optimism\nlevels your social support\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand your ability to see stress\nas a challenge instead of as a threat i talked to a new england boarding school probably the most prestigious one and they said we already know that so every year instead of just teaching\nour students we have a wellness week and we are so excited monday night\nwe have the world's leading expert\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twill speak about adolescent depression tuesday night\nit is school violence and bullying wednesday night is eating disorders thursday night is illicit drug use and friday night we are trying to decide\nbetween risky sex or happiness i said that is most people's\nfriday nights which i am glad you liked but they did not like that at all silence on the phone and into the silence i said i had be happy to speak at your school but that is not a wellness week that is a sickness week you have outlined all the negative\nthings that can happen but not talked about the positive the absence of disease is not health here's how we get to health we need to reverse the formula\nfor happiness and success in the last three years i have traveled to 45 countries working with schools and companies\nin the midst of an economic downturn and i found that\nmost companies and schools\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollow a formula\nfor success which is this if i work harder i will be more successful and if i am more successful then i will be happier that undergirds most\nof our parenting and managing styles the way that we motivate our behavior and the problem is it is scientifically\nbroken and backwards for two reasons every time your brain has a success you just changed the goalpost\nof what success looked like you got good grades now you have to get better grades you got into a good school\nand after you get into a better one you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we are going to change it and if happiness is on the opposite side\nof success your brain never gets there we have pushed happiness\nover the cognitive horizon as a society and that is because we think\nwe have to be successful then we will be happier but our brains work in the opposite order if you can raise somebody's level\nof positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now\ncall a happiness advantage which is your brain at positive\nperforms significantly better\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan at negative neutral or stressed your intelligence rises your creativity\nrises your energy levels rise in fact we have found that every single\nbusiness outcome improves your brain at positive\nis 31% more productive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan your brain at negative neutral or stressed you are 37% better at sales doctors are 19 percent\nfaster more accurate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat coming up with the correct diagnosis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen positive instead\nof negative neutral or stressed which means we can reverse the formula if we can find a way of becoming\npositive in the present then our brains work\neven more successfully\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas we are able to work harder faster and more intelligently we need to be able to reverse this formula\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso we can start to see what our brains\nare actually capable of because dopamine which floods\ninto your system when you are positive has two functions not only does it make you happier it turns on all of the learning\ncenters in your brain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tallowing you to adapt\nto the world in a different way we have found there are ways\nthat you can train your brain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be able to become more positive in just a two-minute span of time\ndone for 21 days in a row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work\nmore optimistically and more successfully we have done these things in research now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin every company that i have worked with getting them to write down three new\nthings that they are grateful for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor 21 days in a row three new things each day and at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof scanning the world not for\nthe negative but for the positive first journaling about one positive experience\nyou have had over the past 24 hours\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tallows your brain to relive it exercise teaches your brain\nthat your behavior matters we find that meditation allows your brain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto get over the cultural adhd\nthat we have been creating\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby trying to do multiple tasks at once\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand allows our brains\nto focus on the task at hand and finally random acts of kindness\nare conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpraising or thanking somebody\nin their support network and by doing these activities\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand by training your brain\njust like we train our bodies what we have found is we can reverse\nthe formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create\nripples of positivity but a real revolution thank you very much  hello doha hello salaam alaikum i love coming to doha it is such an international place it feels like the

is amazing and it helps change the image\nof the middle east in the west a lot of americans do not know\na lot about us about the middle east i am iranian and american i am there i know i have traveled here there is so much we laugh right people do not know we laugh when i did the axis of evil comedy tour it came out on comedy central i went online to see\nwhat people were saying i ended up on a conservative website one guy wrote another guy he said i never knew these people laughed think about it you never see us laughing\nin american film or television right maybe like an evil laugh wuhahaha i will kill you in the name\nof allah wuhahahahaha but never like ha ha ha ha la we like to laugh we like to celebrate life and i wish more americans\nwould travel here i always encourage my

safest place\nto sit on the plane some passengers overheard them somehow misconstrued that\nas terrorist talk got them kicked off the plane it was a family a mother father child talking about the

are\non an airplane in the us just speak your mother tongue that way no one knows\nwhat you are saying life goes on granted some mother tongues\nmight sound a little threatening\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the average american if you are walking\ndown the aisle speaking arabic you might freak them out

now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin your future best self where would you put your time\nand your energy there was a recent survey of millennials\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tasking them what their\nmost important life goals were and over 80 percent said\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat a major life goal for them\nwas to get rich and another 50 percent\nof those same young adults\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsaid that another major life goal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas to become famous and we are constantly told\nto lean in to work to push harder\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand achieve more we are given the impression that these\nare the things that we need to go after\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make\nand how those choices work out for them those pictures\nare almost impossible to get most of what we know about human life\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe know from asking people\nto remember the past and as we know hindsight\nis anything but 20/20 we forget vast amounts\nof what happens to us in life and sometimes memory\nis downright creative but what if we could watch entire lives\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas they unfold through time what if we could study people\nfrom the time that they were teenagers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall the way into old age\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto see what really keeps people\nhappy and healthy we did that the harvard study of adult development\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmay be the longest study\nof adult life that is ever been done for 75 years we have tracked\nthe lives of 724 men year after year asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way\nwithout knowing how their life stories\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all projects of this kind\nfall apart within a decade\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause too many people\ndrop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball\nfurther down the field but through a combination of luck\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the persistence\nof several generations of researchers this study has survived about 60 of our original 724 men\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s and we are now beginning to study\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe more than 2,000 children of these men and i am the fourth director of the study since 1938 we have tracked the lives\nof two groups of men the first group started in the study\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen they were sophomores\nat harvard college they all finished college\nduring world war ii and then most went off\nto serve in the war and the second group that we have followed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas a group of boys\nfrom boston's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspecifically because they were\nfrom some of the most troubled\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand disadvantaged families\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the boston of the 1930s most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed they were given medical exams we went to their homes\nand we interviewed their parents and then these teenagers\ngrew up into adults\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers\nand bricklayers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some climbed the social ladder\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom the bottom\nall the way to the very top and some made that journey\nin the opposite direction the founders of this study\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould never in their wildest dreams\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave imagined that i would be\nstanding here today 75 years later telling you that\nthe study still continues every two years our patient\nand dedicated research staff\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalls up our men\nand asks them if we can send them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyet one more set of questions\nabout their lives many of the inner city boston men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just is not that interesting the harvard men never ask that question to get the clearest picture\nof these lives we do not just send them questionnaires we interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records\nfrom their doctors we draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children we videotape them talking with their wives\nabout their deepest concerns and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif they would join us\nas members of the study many of the women said you know it is about time so what have we learned what are the lessons that come\nfrom the tens of thousands of pages\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof information that we have generated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton these lives well the lessons are not about wealth\nor fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get\nfrom this 75-year study is this good relationships keep us\nhappier and healthier period we have learned three big lessons\nabout relationships the first is that social connections\nare really good for us and that loneliness kills it turns out that people\nwho are more socially connected\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto family to friends to community are happier they are physically healthier and they live longer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan people who are less well connected and the experience of loneliness\nturns out to be toxic people who are more isolated\nthan they want to be from others\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfind that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand they live shorter lives\nthan people who are not lonely and the sad fact\nis that at any given time more than one in five americans\nwill report that they are lonely and we know that you\ncan be lonely in a crowd\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis that it is not just\nthe number of friends you have and it is not whether or not\nyou are in a committed relationship but it is the quality\nof your close relationships that matters it turns out that living in the midst\nof conflict is really bad for our health high-conflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective once we had followed our men\nall the way into their 80s we wanted to look back at them at midlife\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand to see if we could predict\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho was going to grow\ninto a happy healthy octogenarian\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand who was not and when we gathered together\neverything we knew about them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat age 50 it was not their middle age\ncholesterol levels\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat predicted how they\nwere going to grow old it was how satisfied they were\nin their relationships the people who were the most satisfied\nin their relationships at age 50\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere the healthiest at age 80 and good close relationships\nseem to buffer us\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom some of the slings and arrows\nof getting old our most happily partnered men and women\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treported in their 80s that on the days\nwhen they had more physical pain their mood stayed just as happy but the people who were\nin unhappy relationships on the days when they\nreported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain and the third big lesson that we learned\nabout relationships and our health\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis that good relationships\ndo not just protect our bodies they protect our brains it turns out that being\nin a securely attached relationship\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto another person in your 80s\nis protective that the people who are in relationships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere they really feel they can count\non the other person in times of need those people's memories\nstay sharper longer and the people in relationships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere they feel they really\ncannot count on the other one those are the people who experience\nearlier memory decline and those good relationships they do not have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples\ncould bicker with each other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tday in and day out but as long as they felt that they\ncould really count on the other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the going got tough those arguments did not take a toll\non their memories so this message that good close relationships\nare good for our health and well-being this is wisdom that is as old as the hills why is this so hard to get\nand so easy to ignore well we are human what we had really like is a quick fix something we can get\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat'll make our lives good\nand keep them that way relationships are messy\nand they are complicated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the hard work of tending\nto family and friends it is not sexy or glamorous it is also lifelong it never ends the people in our 75-year study\nwho were the happiest in retirement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere the people who had actively worked\nto replace workmates with new playmates just like the millennials\nin that recent survey many of our men when they\nwere starting out as young adults\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treally believed that fame and wealth\nand high achievement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere what they needed to go after\nto have a good life but over and over over these 75 years our study has shown\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat the people who fared the best were\nthe people who leaned in to relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let us say you are 25 or you are 40 or you are 60 what might leaning in\nto relationships even look like well the possibilities\nare practically endless it might be something as simple\nas replacing screen time with people time\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor livening up a stale relationship\nby doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member\nwho you have not spoken to in years because those all-too-common family feuds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttake a terrible toll\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the people who hold the grudges i had like to close with a quote\nfrom mark twain more than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this there is not time so brief is life for bickerings apologies heartburnings callings to account there is only time for loving and but an instant so to speak for that the good life is built\nwith good relationships thank you  so i will start with this a couple\nyears ago an event planner called me\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause i was going\nto do a speaking event and she called and she said i am really struggling with how\nto write about you on the little flyer and i thought well what is the struggle and she said well i saw you speak and i am going to call you\na researcher i think but i am afraid if i call you\na researcher no one will come because they will think\nyou are boring and irrelevant and i was like okay and she said but the thing\ni liked about your talk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis you are a storyteller so i think what i will do\nis just call you a storyteller and of course the academic insecure part of me\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas like you are going\nto call me a what and she said i am going\nto call you a storyteller and i was like why not 'magic pixie i was like let me think\nabout this for a second i tried to call deep on my courage and i thought you know i am a storyteller i am a qualitative researcher i collect stories that is what i do and maybe stories\nare just data with a soul and maybe i am just a storyteller and so i said you know what why do not you just say\ni am a researcher-storyteller and she went ha ha there is no such thing so i am a researcher-storyteller and i am going to talk to you today \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe are talking about\nexpanding perception \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand so i want to talk to you\nand tell some stories\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout a piece of my research\nthat fundamentally expanded my perception\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand really actually changed\nthe way that i live and love\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand work and parent and this is where my story starts when i was a young researcher doctoral student my first year i had\na research professor who said to us here's the thing if you cannot\nmeasure it it does not exist and i thought he was just\nsweet-talking me i was like really and he was like absolutely and so you have to understand\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat i have a bachelor's\nand a master's in social work and i was getting my ph.d in social work so my entire academic career\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas surrounded by people who kind of\nbelieved in the \"life's messy love it and i am more of the life's messy clean it up organize it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand put it into a bento box and so to think that i had found my way to found a career that takes me \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treally one of the big sayings\nin social work is lean into the discomfort of the work and i am like knock discomfort\nupside the head\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand move it over and get all a's that was my mantra so i was very excited about this and so i thought you know what this is the career for me because i am interested\nin some messy topics but i want to be able\nto make them not messy i want to understand them i want to hack into these things\nthat i know are important\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand lay the code out for everyone to see so where i started was with connection because by the time\nyou are a social worker for 10 years what you realize is that connection\nis why we are here it is what gives purpose\nand meaning to our lives this is what it is all about it does not matter whether\nyou talk to people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho work in social justice mental health and abuse and neglect what we know is that connection the ability to feel connected is \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tneurobiologically\nthat is how we are wired \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit is why we are here so i thought you know what i am going to start with connection well you know that situation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere you get an evaluation\nfrom your boss and she tells you 37 things\nthat you do really awesome and one \"opportunity for growth and all you can think about\nis that opportunity for growth right well apparently this is the way\nmy work went as well because when you ask people about love they tell you about heartbreak when you ask people about belonging they will tell you their most excruciating\nexperiences of being excluded and when you ask people about connection the stories they told me\nwere about disconnection so very quickly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 really about six weeks\ninto this research \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti ran into this unnamed thing\nthat absolutely unraveled connection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a way that i did not understand\nor had never seen and so i pulled back out of the research\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand thought i need\nto figure out what this is and it turned out to be shame and shame is really easily understood\nas the fear of disconnection is there something about me that if other people know it or see it that i will not be worthy of connection the things i can tell you about it it is universal we all have it the only people who do not experience shame\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave no capacity for human\nempathy or connection no one wants to talk about it and the less you talk about it the more you have it what underpinned this shame this \"i am not good enough \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich we all know that feeling i am not blank enough i am not thin enough rich enough beautiful enough smart enough promoted enough the thing that underpinned this\nwas excruciating vulnerability this idea of in order\nfor connection to happen we have to allow ourselves\nto be seen really seen and you know how i feel\nabout vulnerability i hate vulnerability and so i thought this is my chance\nto beat it back with my measuring stick i am going in i am going\nto figure this stuff out i am going to spend a year i am going to totally deconstruct shame i am going to understand\nhow vulnerability works and i am going to outsmart it so i was ready and i was really excited as you know it is not going to turn out well you know this so i could tell you a lot about shame but i had have to borrow\neveryone else's time but here's what i can tell you\nthat it boils down to \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand this may be one of the most important\nthings that i have ever learned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the decade of doing this research my one year turned into six years thousands of stories hundreds\nof long interviews focus groups at one point people were\nsending me journal pages\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand sending me their stories \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthousands of pieces of data in six years and i kind of got a handle on it i kind of understood this is\nwhat shame is this is how it works i wrote a book i published a theory but something was not okay \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand what it was is that if i roughly\ntook the people i interviewed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand divided them into people who really\nhave a sense of worthiness \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is what this comes down to a sense of worthiness \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey have a strong sense\nof love and belonging \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand folks who struggle for it and folks who are always wondering\nif they are good enough there was only one variable that separated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe people who have a strong sense\nof love and belonging\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have\na strong sense of love and belonging\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbelieve they are worthy\nof love and belonging that is it they believe they are worthy and to me the hard part of the one thing\nthat keeps us out of connection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis our fear that we are not\nworthy of connection was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better so what i did is i took\nall of the interviews\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere i saw worthiness where i saw people living that way and just looked at those what do these people have in common i have a slight office supply addiction but that is another talk so i had a manila folder and i had a sharpie and i was like what am i going\nto call this research and the first words that came\nto my mind were \"whole-hearted these are whole-hearted people living from this deep sense of worthiness so i wrote at the top\nof the manila folder and i started looking at the data in fact i did it first in a four-day very intensive data analysis where i went back pulled the interviews the stories pulled the incidents what is the theme what is the pattern my husband left town with the kids\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause i always go into this\njackson pollock crazy thing where i am just writing\nand in my researcher mode and so here's what i found what they had in common\nwas a sense of courage and i want to separate courage\nand bravery for you for a minute courage the original\ndefinition of courage when it first came\ninto the english language \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit is from the latin word \"cor meaning \"heart\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the original definition was to tell\nthe story of who you are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith your whole heart and so these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect they had the compassion to be kind\nto themselves first and then to others because as it turns out we cannot practice compassion\nwith other people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif we cannot treat ourselves kindly and the last was they had connection and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this was the hard part \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas a result of authenticity they were willing to let go\nof who they thought they should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin order to be who they were which you have to absolutely do that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor connection the other thing that they had\nin common was this they fully embraced vulnerability they believed that what made them\nvulnerable made them beautiful they did not talk about vulnerability\nbeing comfortable nor did they really talk\nabout it being excruciating \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas i had heard it earlier\nin the shame interviewing they just talked about it being necessary they talked about the willingness\nto say i love you\" first the willingness to do something\nwhere there are no guarantees the willingness to breathe\nthrough waiting for the doctor to call\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tafter your mammogram they are willing to invest\nin a relationship\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat may or may not work out they thought this was fundamental i personally thought it was betrayal i could not believe i had pledged\nallegiance to research where our job \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou know the definition of research\nis to control and predict to study phenomena for the explicit\nreason to control and predict and now my mission to control and predict\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad turned up the answer\nthat the way to live is with vulnerability\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand to stop controlling and predicting this led to a little breakdown \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00e2\u0080\u0094 which actually looked more like this and it did i call it a breakdown my therapist\ncalls it a spiritual awakening a spiritual awakening\nsounds better than breakdown but i assure you it was a breakdown and i had to put my data away\nand go find a therapist let me tell you something you know who you are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen you call your friends and say i think i need to see somebody do you have any recommendations because about five\nof my friends were like wooo i would not want\nto be your therapist i was like what does that mean and they are like i am just saying you know do not bring your measuring stick i was like okay so i found a therapist my first meeting with her diana \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti brought in my list of the way\nthe whole-hearted live and i sat down and she said how are you and i said i am great i am okay she said what is going on and this is a therapist\nwho sees therapists because we have to go to those because their b.s meters are good and so i said here's the thing i am struggling and she said what is the struggle and i said well i have\na vulnerability issue and i know that vulnerability\nis the core of shame and fear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand our struggle for worthiness but it appears that it is also\nthe birthplace of joy of creativity of belonging of love and i think i have a problem and i need some help and i said but here's the thing no family stuff no childhood shit i just need some strategies thank you so she goes like this and then i said it is bad right and she said it is neither good nor bad it just is what it is and i said oh my god this is going to suck and it did and it did not and it took about a year and you know how there are people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat when they realize that vulnerability\nand tenderness are important that they surrender and walk into it a that is not me and b i do not even hang out\nwith people like that for me it was a yearlong street fight it was a slugfest vulnerability pushed i pushed back i lost the fight but probably won my life back and so then i went back into the research\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand spent the next couple of years\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treally trying to understand\nwhat they the whole-hearted what choices they were making and what we are doing with vulnerability why do we struggle with it so much am i alone in struggling\nwith vulnerability no so this is what i learned we numb vulnerability \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen we are waiting for the call it was funny i sent something out\non twitter and on facebook\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat says how would you\ndefine vulnerability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half i had 150 responses because i wanted to know what is out there having to ask my husband for help\nbecause i am sick and we are newly married initiating sex with my husband initiating sex with my wife being turned down asking someone out waiting for the doctor to call back getting laid off laying off people this is the world we live in we live in a vulnerable world and one of the ways we deal\nwith it is we numb vulnerability and i think there is evidence \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand it is not the only reason\nthis evidence exists but i think it is a huge cause \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe are the most in-debt obese addicted and medicated\nadult cohort in u.s history the problem is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and i learned this\nfrom the research \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you cannot selectively numb emotion you cannot say here's the bad stuff here's vulnerability here's grief here's shame here's fear here's disappointment i do not want to feel these i am going to have a couple of beers\nand a banana nut muffin i do not want to feel these and i know that is knowing laughter i hack into your lives for a living god you cannot numb those hard feelings\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithout numbing\nthe other affects our emotions you cannot selectively numb so when we numb those we numb joy we numb gratitude we numb happiness and then we are miserable and we are looking\nfor purpose and meaning and then we feel vulnerable so then we have a couple of beers\nand a banana nut muffin and it becomes this dangerous cycle one of the things that i think\nwe need to think about\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis why and how we numb and it does not just have to be addiction the other thing we do is we make\neverything that is uncertain certain religion has gone from a belief\nin faith and mystery to certainty i am right you are wrong shut up that is it just certain the more afraid we are the more vulnerable we are the more afraid we are this is what politics looks like today there is no discourse anymore there is no conversation there is just blame you know how blame\nis described in the research a way to discharge pain and discomfort we perfect if there is anyone who wants their life\nto look like this it would be me but it does not work because what we do is we take fat\nfrom our butts and put it in our cheeks which just i hope in 100 years people will look back and go wow and we perfect most dangerously our children let me tell you what we think\nabout children they are hardwired for struggle\nwhen they get here and when you hold those perfect\nlittle babies in your hand our job is not to say look at her she is perfect my job is just to keep her perfect \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmake sure she makes the tennis team\nby fifth grade and yale by seventh that is not our job our job is to look and say you know what you are imperfect and you are wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging that is our job show me a generation\nof kids raised like that and we will end the problems i think that we see today we pretend that what we do\ndoes not have an effect on people we do that in our personal lives we do that corporate \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhether it is a bailout an oil spill a recall we pretend like what we are doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes not have a huge impact\non other people i would say to companies this is not our first rodeo people we just need you to be authentic\nand real and say we are sorry we will fix it but there is another way and i will leave you with this this is what i have found to let ourselves be seen deeply seen vulnerably seen to love with our whole hearts even though there is no guarantee \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand that is really hard and i can tell you as a parent that is excruciatingly difficult \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto practice gratitude and joy\nin those moments of terror when we are wondering can i love you this much can i believe in this this passionately can i be this fierce about this just to be able to stop and instead of\ncatastrophizing what might happen to say i am just so grateful because to feel this vulnerable\nmeans i am alive and the last which i think\nis probably the most important is to believe that we are enough because when we work from a place i believe that says i am enough then we stop screaming\nand start listening we are kinder and gentler\nto the people around us and we are kinder and gentler to ourselves that is all i have thank you  how do you explain\nwhen things do not go as we assume or better how do you explain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen others are able to achieve things\nthat seem to defy all of the assumptions for example why is apple so innovative year after year after year they are more innovative\nthan all their competition and yet they are just a computer company they are just like everyone else they have the same access\nto the same talent the same agencies the same consultants the same media then why is it that they seem\nto have something different why is it that martin luther king\nled the civil rights movement he was not the only man\nwho suffered in pre-civil rights america and he certainly was not\nthe only great orator of the day why him and why is it that the wright brothers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere able to figure out controlled powered man flight\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen there were certainly other teams\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho were better qualified better funded \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand they did not achieve\npowered man flight and the wright brothers beat them to it there is something else at play here about three and a half years ago i made a discovery and this discovery profoundly changed\nmy view on how i thought the world worked and it even profoundly changed the way\nin which i operate in it as it turns out there is a pattern as it turns out all the great inspiring\nleaders and organizations in the world whether it is apple or martin luther king\nor the wright brothers they all think act and communicate\nthe exact same way and it is the complete opposite\nto everyone else all i did was codify it and it is probably\nthe world's simplest idea i call it the golden circle why how what this little idea explains\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhy some organizations and some leaders\nare able to inspire where others are not let me define the terms really quickly every single person every single\norganization on the planet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tknows what they do 100 percent some know how they do it whether you call it\nyour differentiated value proposition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor your proprietary process or your usp but very very few people or organizations\nknow why they do what they do and by \"why\" i do not mean\n\"to make a profit that is a result it is always a result by \"why i mean what is your purpose what is your cause what is your belief why does your organization exist why do you get out of bed in the morning and why should anyone care as a result the way we think we act the way we communicate\nis from the outside in it is obvious we go from the clearest thing\nto the fuzziest thing but the inspired leaders\nand the inspired organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tregardless of their size regardless of their industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall think act and communicate\nfrom the inside out let me give you an example i use apple because they are easy\nto understand and everybody gets it if apple were like everyone else a marketing message from them\nmight sound like this we make great computers they are beautifully designed simple to use and user friendly want to buy one meh that is how most of us communicate that is how most marketing\nand sales are done that is how we communicate interpersonally we say what we do we say how we are different or better\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand we expect some sort of a behavior a purchase a vote something like that here's our new law firm we have the best lawyers\nwith the biggest clients we always perform for our clients here's our new car it gets great gas mileage it has leather seats buy our car but it is uninspiring here's how apple actually communicates everything we do we believe in challenging the status quo we believe in thinking differently the way we challenge the status quo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis by making our products\nbeautifully designed simple to use and user friendly we just happen to make great computers want to buy one totally different right you are ready to buy a computer from me i just reversed\nthe order of the information what it proves to us is\nthat people do not buy what you do people buy why you do it this explains why\nevery single person in this room\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis perfectly comfortable buying\na computer from apple but we are also perfectly comfortable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuying an mp3 player from apple or a phone from apple or a dvr from apple as i said before apple's just a computer company nothing distinguishes them structurally\nfrom any of their competitors their competitors are equally qualified\nto make all of these products in fact they tried a few years ago gateway\ncame out with flat-screen tvs they are eminently qualified\nto make flat-screen tvs they have been making\nflat-screen monitors for years nobody bought one dell came out with mp3 players and pdas and they make great quality products and they can make perfectly\nwell-designed products \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand nobody bought one in fact talking about it now we cannot even imagine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbuying an mp3 player from dell why would you buy one\nfrom a computer company but we do it every day people do not buy what you do they buy why you do it the goal is not to do business\nwith everybody who needs what you have the goal is to do business with people\nwho believe what you believe here's the best part none of what i am telling you\nis my opinion it is all grounded\nin the tenets of biology not psychology biology if you look at a cross-section\nof the human brain from the top down the human brain is actually broken\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinto three major components\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat correlate perfectly\nwith the golden circle our newest brain our homo sapien brain our neocortex corresponds with the \"what\" level the neocortex is responsible\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor all of our rational\nand analytical thought and language the middle two sections make up\nour limbic brains and our limbic brains are responsible\nfor all of our feelings like trust and loyalty it is also responsible\nfor all human behavior all decision-making and it has no capacity for language in other words when we communicate\nfrom the outside in yes people can understand vast\namounts of complicated information\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlike features and benefits\nand facts and figures it just does not drive behavior when we can communicate\nfrom the inside out we are talking directly\nto the part of the brain\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat controls behavior and then we allow people to rationalize it\nwith the tangible things we say and do this is where gut decisions come from sometimes you can give somebody\nall the facts and figures and they say i know\nwhat all the facts and details say but it just does not feel right why would we use that verb it does not \"feel\" right because the part of the brain\nthat controls decision-making\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes not control language the best we can muster up is i do not know it just does not feel right or sometimes you say you are leading\nwith your heart or soul i hate to break it to you those are not other body parts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrolling your behavior it is all happening here\nin your limbic brain the part of the brain that controls\ndecision-making and not language but if you do not know\nwhy you do what you do and people respond\nto why you do what you do then how will you ever get people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto vote for you or buy something from you or more importantly be loyal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand want to be a part\nof what it is that you do the goal is not just to sell\nto people who need what you have the goal is to sell to people\nwho believe what you believe the goal is not just\nto hire people who need a job it is to hire people\nwho believe what you believe i always say that you know if you hire people just because they can\ndo a job they will work for your money but if they believe what you believe they will work for you with blood\nand sweat and tears nowhere else is there a better example\nthan with the wright brothers most people do not know\nabout samuel pierpont langley and back in the early 20th century the pursuit of powered man flight\nwas like the dot com of the day everybody was trying it and samuel pierpont langley\nhad what we assume to be the recipe for success even now you ask people why did your product\nor why did your company fail and people always give\nyou the same permutation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the same three things under-capitalized the wrong people bad market conditions it is always the same three things so let us explore that samuel pierpont langley\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas given 50,000 dollars\nby the war department\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto figure out this flying machine money was no problem he held a seat at harvard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand worked at the smithsonian\nand was extremely well-connected he knew all the big minds of the day he hired the best minds money could find\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the market conditions were fantastic the new york times\nfollowed him around everywhere and everyone was rooting for langley then how come we have never heard\nof samuel pierpont langley a few hundred miles away in dayton ohio orville and wilbur wright they had none of what we consider\nto be the recipe for success they had no money they paid for their dream\nwith the proceeds from their bicycle shop not a single person\non the wright brothers team\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad a college education not even orville or wilbur and the new york times\nfollowed them around nowhere the difference was orville and wilbur were driven by a cause by a purpose by a belief they believed that if they could\nfigure out this flying machine it will change the course of the world samuel pierpont langley was different he wanted to be rich and he wanted to be famous he was in pursuit of the result he was in pursuit of the riches and lo and behold look what happened the people who believed\nin the wright brothers dream\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tworked with them with blood\nand sweat and tears the others just worked for the paycheck they tell stories of how every time\nthe wright brothers went out they would have to take\nfive sets of parts because that is how many times\nthey would crash before supper and eventually on december 17th 1903 the wright brothers took flight and no one was there\nto even experience it we found out about it a few days later and further proof that langley\nwas motivated by the wrong thing the day the wright brothers took flight he quit he could have said that is an amazing discovery guys and i will improve\nupon your technology but he did not he was not first he did not get rich he did not get famous so he quit people do not buy what you do they buy why you do it if you talk about what you believe you will attract those\nwho believe what you believe but why is it important to attract\nthose who believe what you believe something called the law\nof diffusion of innovation if you do not know the law you know the terminology the first 2.5% of our population\nare our innovators the next 13.5% of our population\nare our early adopters the next 34% are your early majority your late majority and your laggards the only reason these people\nbuy touch-tone phones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis because you cannot buy\nrotary phones anymore we all sit at various places\nat various times on this scale but what the law of diffusion\nof innovation tells us\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis that if you want mass-market success\nor mass-market acceptance of an idea you cannot have it\nuntil you achieve this tipping point\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween 15 and 18 percent\nmarket penetration and then the system tips i love asking businesses what is your conversion on new business they love to tell you it is about 10 percent proudly well you can trip\nover 10% of the customers we all have about 10% who just \"get it that is how we describe them right that is like that gut feeling oh they just get it the problem is how do you\nfind the ones that get it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore doing business\nversus the ones who do not get it so it is this here this little gap\nthat you have to close as jeffrey moore calls it crossing the chasm\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause you see the early majority\nwill not try something\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil someone else has tried it first and these guys the innovators\nand the early adopters they are comfortable\nmaking those gut decisions they are more comfortable\nmaking those intuitive decisions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat are driven by what\nthey believe about the world\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand not just what product is available these are the people who stood\nin line for six hours\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto buy an iphone when they first came out when you could have bought one\noff the shelf the next week these are the people\nwho spent 40,000 dollars\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton flat-screen tvs\nwhen they first came out even though the technology\nwas substandard and by the way they did not do it\nbecause the technology was so great they did it for themselves it is because they wanted to be first people do not buy what you do they buy why you do it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand what you do simply proves\nwhat you believe in fact people will do the things\nthat prove what they believe the reason that person bought the iphone\nin the first six hours stood in line for six hours was because of what they believed\nabout the world and how they wanted everybody to see them they were first people do not buy what you do they buy why you do it so let me give you a famous example a famous failure and a famous success\nof the law of diffusion of innovation first the famous failure it is a commercial example as we said before the recipe for success\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis money and the right people\nand the right market conditions you should have success then look at tivo from the time tivo came out\nabout eight or nine years ago\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto this current day they are the single highest-quality\nproduct on the market hands down there is no dispute they were extremely well-funded market conditions were fantastic i mean we use tivo as verb i tivo stuff on my piece-of-junk\ntime warner dvr all the time but tivo's a commercial failure they have never made money and when they went ipo their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand then plummeted and it is never traded above 10 in fact i do not think\nit is even traded above six except for a couple of little spikes because you see when tivo\nlaunched their product they told us all what they had they said we have a product\nthat pauses live tv skips commercials rewinds live tv\nand memorizes your viewing habits\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithout you even asking and the cynical majority said we do not believe you we do not need it we do not like it you are scaring us what if they had said if you are the kind of person\nwho likes to have total control\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover every aspect of your life boy do we have a product for you it pauses live tv skips commercials memorizes your viewing habits etc etc people do not buy what you do they buy why you do it and what you do simply serves\nas the proof of what you believe now let me give you a successful example\nof the law of diffusion of innovation in the summer of 1963 250,000 people showed up\non the mall in washington\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto hear dr king speak they sent out no invitations and there was no website\nto check the date how do you do that well dr king\nwas not the only man in america\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho was a great orator he was not the only man\nin america who suffered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a pre-civil rights america in fact some of his ideas were bad but he had a gift he did not go around telling people\nwhat needed to change in america he went around\nand told people what he believed i believe i believe i believe he told people and people who believed what he believed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttook his cause and they made it\ntheir own and they told people and some of those people\ncreated structures\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto get the word out to even more people and lo and behold 250,000 people showed up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the right day at the right time\nto hear him speak how many of them showed up for him zero they showed up for themselves it is what they believed about america\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat got them to travel\nin a bus for eight hours\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto stand in the sun in washington\nin the middle of august it is what they believed and it was not about black versus white 25% of the audience was white dr king believed that there are\ntwo types of laws in this world those that are made by a higher authority\nand those that are made by men and not until all the laws\nthat are made by men\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare consistent with the laws\nmade by the higher authority\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twill we live in a just world it just so happened\nthat the civil rights movement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas the perfect thing to help him\nbring his cause to life we followed not for him but for ourselves by the way he gave\nthe \"i have a dream\" speech not the \"i have a plan\" speech listen to politicians now with their comprehensive 12-point plans they are not inspiring anybody because there are leaders\nand there are those who lead leaders hold a position\nof power or authority but those who lead inspire us whether they are individuals\nor organizations we follow those who lead not because we have to but because we want to we follow those who lead not for them but for ourselves and it is those who start with \"why\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat have the ability\nto inspire those around them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor find others who inspire them thank you very much  i felt a funeral in my brain and mourners to and fro\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkept treading \u00e2\u0080\u0094 treading \u00e2\u0080\u0094\ntill [it seemed]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat sense was breaking through \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand when they all were seated a service like a drum \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tkept beating \u00e2\u0080\u0094 beating \u00e2\u0080\u0094\ntill i [thought]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmy mind was going numb \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand then i heard them lift a box\nand creak across my soul\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith those same boots of lead again then space \u00e2\u0080\u0094 began to toll as [all] the heavens were a bell and being but] an ear and i and silence some strange race wrecked solitary here \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[and] then a plank in reason broke and i fell down and down \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand hit a world at every plunge and finished knowing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then \u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe know depression through metaphors emily dickinson was able\nto convey it in language goya in an image half the purpose of art\nis to describe such iconic states as for me i had always\nthought myself tough one of the people who could survive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif i had been sent to a concentration camp in 1991 i had a series of losses my mother died a relationship i had been in ended i moved back to the united states\nfrom some years abroad and i got through all of those\nexperiences intact but in 1994 three years later i found myself losing interest\nin almost everything i did not want to do any of the things\ni had previously wanted to do and i did not know why the opposite of depression\nis not happiness but vitality and it was vitality\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat seemed to seep away\nfrom me in that moment everything there was to do\nseemed like too much work i would come home\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand i would see the red light\nflashing on my answering machine and instead of being thrilled\nto hear from my friends i would think what a lot of people that is\nto have to call back or i would decide i should have lunch and then i would think but i had have to get the food out\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand put it on a plate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand cut it up and chew it and swallow it and it felt to me\nlike the stations of the cross and one of the things that often gets lost\nin discussions of depression\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis that you know it is ridiculous you know it is ridiculous\nwhile you are experiencing it you know that most people manage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto listen to their messages and eat lunch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand organize themselves to take a shower\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand go out the front door\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand that it is not a big deal and yet you are nonetheless in its grip\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand you are unable to figure out\nany way around it and so i began to feel myself doing less\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand thinking less\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand feeling less it was a kind of nullity and then the anxiety set in if you told me that i had have to be\ndepressed for the next month i would say as long i know it will be over\nin november i can do it but if you said to me you have to have acute anxiety\nfor the next month i would rather slit my wrist\nthan go through it it was the feeling all the time\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlike that feeling you have\nif you are walking\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand you slip or trip\nand the ground is rushing up at you but instead of lasting half a second the way that does it lasted for six months it is a sensation\nof being afraid all the time\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut not even knowing\nwhat it is that you are afraid of and it was at that point\nthat i began to think\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat it was just too painful to be alive and that the only reason\nnot to kill oneself\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas so as not to hurt other people and finally one day i woke up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand i thought perhaps i had had a stroke because i lay in bed completely frozen looking at the telephone thinking something is wrong\nand i should call for help and i could not reach out my arm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand pick up the phone and dial and finally after four full hours\nof my lying and staring at it the phone rang and somehow i managed to pick it up and it was my father and i said i am in serious trouble we need to do something the next day i started\nwith the medications and the therapy and i also started reckoning\nwith this terrible question if i am not the tough person\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho could have made it\nthrough a concentration camp then who am i and if i have to take medication is that medication making me\nmore fully myself or is it making me someone else and how do i feel about it\nif it is making me someone else i had two advantages\nas i went into the fight the first is that i knew that objectively speaking i had a nice life and that if i could only get well there was something at the other end\nthat was worth living for and the other was\nthat i had access to good treatment but i nonetheless emerged and relapsed and emerged and relapsed and emerged and relapsed and finally understood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti would have to be on medication\nand in therapy forever and i thought but is it a chemical problem\nor a psychological problem and does it need a chemical cure\nor a philosophical cure and i could not figure out which it was and then i understood that actually we are not advanced enough in either area\nfor it to explain things fully the chemical cure\nand the psychological cure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tboth have a role to play and i also figured out\nthat depression was something\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat was braided so deep into us\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there was no separating it\nfrom our character and personality i want to say that the treatments we have\nfor depression are appalling they are not very effective they are extremely costly they come with innumerable side effects they are a disaster but i am so grateful that i live now\nand not 50 years ago when there would have been\nalmost nothing to be done i hope that 50 years hence people will hear about my treatments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand be appalled that anyone endured\nsuch primitive science depression is the flaw in love if you were married\nto someone and thought well if my wife dies i will find another one it would not be love as we know it there is no such thing as love\nwithout the anticipation of loss and that specter of despair\ncan be the engine of intimacy there are three things\npeople tend to confuse depression grief and sadness grief is explicitly reactive if you have a loss\nand you feel incredibly unhappy and then six months later you are still deeply sad but you are functioning a little better it is probably grief and it will probably ultimately\nresolve itself in some measure if you experience a catastrophic loss and you feel terrible and six months later\nyou can barely function at all then it is probably a depression\nthat was triggered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby the catastrophic circumstances the trajectory tells us a great deal people think of depression\nas being just sadness it is much much too much sadness much too much grief\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat far too slight a cause as i set out to understand depression and to interview people\nwho had experienced it i found that there were people\nwho seemed on the surface to have what sounded like\nrelatively mild depression\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho were nonetheless\nutterly disabled by it and there were other people\nwho had what sounded\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas they described it\nlike terribly severe depression\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho nonetheless had good lives\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the interstices\nbetween their depressive episodes and i set out to find out\nwhat it is that causes some people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be more resilient than other people what are the mechanisms\nthat allow people to survive and i went out and i interviewed\nperson after person\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho was suffering with depression one of the first people i interviewed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdescribed depression\nas a slower way of being dead and that was a good thing\nfor me to hear early on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause it reminded me\nthat that slow way of being dead\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcan lead to actual deadness that this is a serious business it is the leading disability worldwide and people die of it every day one of the people i talked to\nwhen i was trying to understand this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas a beloved friend\nwho i had known for many years and who had had a psychotic episode\nin her freshman year of college and then plummeted\ninto a horrific depression she had bipolar illness or manic depression as it was then known and then she did very well\nfor many years on lithium and then eventually she was taken off her lithium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto see how she would do without it and she had another psychosis and then plunged into the worst depression\nthat i had ever seen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin which she sat\nin her parents apartment more or less catatonic essentially without moving day after day after day and when i interviewed her\nabout that experience some years later \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshe is a poet and psychotherapist\nnamed maggie robbins \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen i interviewed her she said i was singing 'where have\nall the flowers gone over and over to occupy my mind i was singing to blot out\nthe things my mind was saying which were you are nothing you are nobody you do not even deserve to live and that was\nwhen i really started thinking\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout killing myself you do not think in depression\nthat you have put on a gray veil\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand are seeing the world\nthrough the haze of a bad mood you think that the veil\nhas been taken away the veil of happiness and that now you are seeing truly it is easier to help\nschizophrenics who perceive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there is something foreign\ninside of them that needs to be exorcised but it is difficult with depressives because we believe\nwe are seeing the truth but the truth lies i became obsessed with that sentence but the truth lies and i discovered as i talked to depressive people that they have\nmany delusional perceptions people will say no one loves me and you say i love you your wife loves you your mother loves you you can answer that one pretty readily at least for most people but people who are depressed\nwill also say no matter what we do we are all just going to die in the end or they will say there can be no true communion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween two human beings each of us is trapped in his own body to which you have to say that is true but i think we should focus right now\non what to have for breakfast a lot of the time what they are expressing\nis not illness but insight and one comes to think\nwhat is really extraordinary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis that most of us know\nabout those existential questions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand they do not distract us very much there was a study i particularly liked\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin which a group of depressed\nand a group of non-depressed people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere asked to play a video\ngame for an hour and at the end of the hour they were asked how many little monsters\nthey thought they had killed the depressive group was usually accurate\nto within about 10 percent and the non-depressed people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tguessed between 15 and 20 times\nas many little monsters \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas they had actually killed a lot of people said when i chose\nto write about my depression that it must be very difficult\nto be out of that closet to have people know they said do people\ntalk to you differently i said yes people\ntalk to me differently they talk to me differently insofar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas they start telling me\nabout their experience or their sister's experience or their friend's experience things are different because now i know\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat depression is the family secret\nthat everyone has i went a few years ago to a conference and on friday of the three-day conference one of the participants\ntook me aside and she said i suffer from depression\nand i am a little embarrassed about it but i have been taking this medication and i just wanted to ask you\nwhat you think and so i did my best to give her\nsuch advice as i could and then she said you know my husband would never understand this he is really the kind of guy to whom\nthis would not make any sense so you know it is just between us and i said yes that is fine on sunday of the same conference her husband took me aside and he said my wife would not think\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat i was really much\nof a guy if she knew this but i have been dealing with this depression\nand i am taking some medication and i wondered what you think they were hiding the same medication\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin two different places\nin the same bedroom and i said that i thought\ncommunication within the marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmight be triggering\nsome of their problems but i was also struck\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby the burdensome nature\nof such mutual secrecy depression is so exhausting it takes up so much\nof your time and energy and silence about it it really does make the depression worse and then i began thinking\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout all the ways\npeople make themselves better i had started off as a medical conservative i thought there were a few\nkinds of therapy that worked it was clear what they were \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere was medication there were certain psychotherapies there was possibly\nelectroconvulsive treatment and that everything else was nonsense but then i discovered something if you have brain cancer and you say that standing on your head\nfor 20 minutes every morning\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes you feel better it may make you feel better but you still have brain cancer and you will still probably die from it but if you say that you have depression and standing on your head\nfor 20 minutes every day\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmakes you feel better then it is worked because depression\nis an illness of how you feel and if you feel better then you are effectively\nnot depressed anymore so i became much more tolerant\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the vast world\nof alternative treatments and i get letters i get hundreds of letters\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom people writing to tell me\nabout what is worked for them someone was asking me\nbackstage today about meditation my favorite of the letters that i got\nwas the one that came from a woman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho wrote and said\nthat she had tried therapy medication she had tried pretty much everything and she had found a solution\nand hoped i would tell the world and that was making\nlittle things from yarn she sent me some of them and i am not wearing them right now i suggested to her\nthat she also should look up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tobsessive compulsive disorder in the dsm and yet when i went to look\nat alternative treatments i also gained perspective\non other treatments i went through\na tribal exorcism in senegal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat involved a great deal of ram's blood\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand that i am not going\nto detail right now but a few years afterwards\ni was in rwanda working on a different project and i happened to describe\nmy experience to someone and he said well that is west africa and we are in east africa and our rituals are\nin some ways very different but we do have some rituals\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat have something in common\nwith what you are describing and he said but we have had a lot of trouble\nwith western mental health workers especially the ones who came\nright after the genocide i said what kind\nof trouble did you have and he said well they would do this bizarre thing they did not take people out\nin the sunshine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere you begin to feel better they did not include drumming\nor music to get people's blood going they did not involve the whole community they did not externalize\nthe depression as an invasive spirit instead what they did was they took people\none at a time into dingy little rooms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand had them talk for an hour\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout bad things\nthat had happened to them he said we had to ask them\nto leave the country now at the other end\nof alternative treatments let me tell you about frank russakoff frank russakoff had the worst depression\nperhaps that i have ever seen in a man he was constantly depressed he was when i met him at a point at which every month he would have electroshock treatment then he would feel\nsort of disoriented for a week then he would feel okay for a week then he would have a week\nof going downhill and then he would have another\nelectroshock treatment and he said to me when i met him it is unbearable to go\nthrough my weeks this way i cannot go on this way and i have figured out\nhow i am going to end it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif i do not get better but he said to me i heard about a protocol at mass general\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a procedure called a cingulotomy which is a brain surgery and i think i am going to give that a try and i remember being amazed\nat that point to think that someone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho clearly had so many bad experiences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith so many different treatments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill had buried in him somewhere enough optimism\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto reach out for one more and he had the cingulotomy and it was incredibly successful he is now a friend of mine he has a lovely wife\nand two beautiful children he wrote me a letter\nthe christmas after the surgery and he said my father sent me two presents this year first a motorized cd rack\nfrom the sharper image\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat i did not really need but i knew he was giving it\nto me to celebrate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fact that i am living on my own\nand have a job i seem to love and the other present\nwas a photo of my grandmother who committed suicide as i unwrapped it i began to cry and my mother came over and said are you crying because\nof the relatives you never knew and i said she had\nthe same disease i have i am crying now as i write to you it is not that i am so sad but i get overwhelmed i think because i could\nhave killed myself but my parents kept me going and so did the doctors and i had the surgery i am alive and grateful we live in the right time even if it does not always feel like it i was struck by the fact that depression\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis broadly perceived to be\na modern western middle-class thing and i went to look at how it operated\nin a variety of other contexts and one of the things\ni was most interested in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas depression among the indigent and so i went out to try to look\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat what was being done\nfor poor people with depression and what i discovered is that poor people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare mostly not being\ntreated for depression depression is the result\nof a genetic vulnerability which is presumably\nevenly distributed in the population and triggering circumstances which are likely to be more severe\nfor people who are impoverished and yet it turns out that if you have\na really lovely life\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut feel miserable all the time you think why do i feel like this i must have depression and you set out to find treatment for it but if you have a perfectly awful life and you feel miserable all the time the way you feel\nis commensurate with your life and it does not occur to you to think maybe this is treatable and so we have an epidemic in this country\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof depression among impoverished people\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is not being picked up\nand that is not being treated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand that is not being addressed and it is a tragedy of a grand order and so i found an academic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho was doing a research project\nin slums outside of d.c where she picked up women\nwho had come in for other health problems\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand diagnosed them with depression and then provided six months\nof the experimental protocol one of them lolly came in and this is what she said\nthe day she came in she said and she was a woman by the way who had seven children she said i used to have a job\nbut i had to give it up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause i could not go out of the house i have nothing to say to my children in the morning i cannot wait for them to leave and then i climb in bed\nand pull the covers over my head and three of the clock when they come home it just comes so fast she said i have been taking\na lot of tylenol anything i can take\nso that i can sleep more my husband has been telling me\ni am stupid i am ugly i wish i could stop the pain well she was brought\ninto this experimental protocol and when i interviewed her\nsix months later she had taken a job working in childcare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the u.s navy she had left the abusive husband and she said to me my kids are so much happier now she said there is one room\nin my new place for the boys\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand one room for the girls but at night they are just\nall up on my bed and we are doing homework\nall together and everything one of them wants to be a preacher one of them wants to be a firefighter and one of the girls says\nshe is going to be a lawyer they do not cry like they used to and they do not fight like they did that is all i need now is my kids things keep on changing the way i dress the way i feel the way i act i can go outside not being afraid anymore and i do not think\nthose bad feelings are coming back and if it were not\nfor dr miranda and that i would still be at home\nwith the covers pulled over my head if i were still alive at all i asked the lord to send me an angel and he heard my prayers i was really moved by these experiences and i decided that i wanted\nto write about them\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot only in a book i was working on but also in an article and i got a commission\nfrom the new york times magazine\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto write about depression\namong the indigent and i turned in my story and my editor called me and said we really cannot publish this and i said why not and she said it just is too far-fetched these people who are sort of\nat the very bottom rung of society\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand then they get\na few months of treatment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand they are virtually ready\nto run morgan stanley it is just too implausible she said i have never even heard\nof anything like it and i said the fact\nthat you have never heard of it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis an indication that it is news and you are a news magazine so after a certain amount of negotiation they agreed to it but i think a lot of what they said\nwas connected in some strange way\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto this distaste that people still have\nfor the idea of treatment the notion that somehow if we went out\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand treated a lot of people\nin indigent communities that would be exploitative because we would be changing them there is this false moral imperative\nthat seems to be all around us that treatment of depression the medications and so on are an artifice and that it is not natural and i think that is very misguided it would be natural\nfor people's teeth to fall out but there is nobody militating\nagainst toothpaste at least not in my circles people then say but is not depression part of what people\nare supposed to experience did not we evolve to have depression is not it part of your personality to which i would say mood is adaptive being able to have sadness and fear\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand joy and pleasure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand all of the other moods that we have that is incredibly valuable and major depression\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis something that happens\nwhen that system gets broken it is maladaptive people will come to me and say i think though if i just\nstick it out for another year i think i can just get through this and i always say to them you may get through it but you will never be 37 again life is short and that is a whole year\nyou are talking about giving up think it through it is a strange poverty\nof the english language and indeed of many other languages that we use this same word depression to describe how a kid feels\nwhen it rains on his birthday and to describe how somebody feels\nthe minute before they commit suicide people say to me well is it\ncontinuous with normal sadness and i say in a way it is continuous\nwith normal sadness there is a certain amount of continuity but it is the same way there is continuity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween having an iron fence\noutside your house\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat gets a little rust spot\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you have to sand off\nand do a little repainting and what happens if you leave\nthe house for 100 years\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand it rusts through\nuntil it is only a pile of orange dust and it is that orange dust spot that orange dust problem that is the one\nwe are setting out to address so now people say you take these happy pills and do you feel happy and i do not but i do not feel sad\nabout having to eat lunch and i do not feel sad\nabout my answering machine and i do not feel sad\nabout taking a shower i feel more in fact i think because i can feel\nsadness without nullity i feel sad about professional\ndisappointments about damaged relationships about global warming those are the things\nthat i feel sad about now and i said to myself well what is the conclusion how did those people who have better lives\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teven with bigger depression\nmanage to get through what is the mechanism of resilience and what i came up with over time\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas that the people\nwho deny their experience and say i was depressed a long time ago i never want to think about it again i am not going to look at it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand i am just going\nto get on with my life ironically those are the people\nwho are most enslaved by what they have shutting out the depression\nstrengthens it while you hide from it it grows and the people who do better\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare the ones who are able to tolerate\nthe fact that they have this condition those who can tolerate their depression\nare the ones who achieve resilience so frank russakoff said to me if i had a do-over i suppose i would not do it this way but in a strange way i am grateful for what i have experienced i am glad to have been\nin the hospital 40 times it taught me so much about love and my relationship\nwith my parents and my doctors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas been so precious to me and will be always and maggie robbins said i used to volunteer in an aids clinic and i would just talk and talk and talk and the people i was dealing with\nwere not very responsive and i thought that is not very friendly\nor helpful of them and then i realized i realized that\nthey were not going to do more\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan make those first\nfew minutes of small talk it was simply going to be an occasion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhere i did not have aids\nand i was not dying but could tolerate the fact that they did\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand they were our needs are our greatest assets it turns out i have learned to give\nall the things i need valuing one's depression\ndoes not prevent a relapse but it may make the prospect of relapse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand even relapse itself\neasier to tolerate the question is not so much\nof finding great meaning\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand deciding your depression\nhas been very meaningful it is of seeking that meaning\nand thinking when it comes again this will be hellish but i will learn something from it i have learned in my own depression\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thow big an emotion can be how it can be more real than facts and i have found that that experience\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas allowed me to experience\npositive emotion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a more intense and more focused way the opposite of depression\nis not happiness but vitality and these days my life is vital even on the days when i am sad i felt that funeral in my brain and i sat next to the colossus\nat the edge of the world and i have discovered\nsomething inside of myself\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat i would have to call a soul\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat i had never formulated\nuntil that day 20 years ago\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen hell came to pay me a surprise visit i think that while i hated being depressed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand would hate to be depressed again i have found a way to love my depression i love it because it has forced me\nto find and cling to joy i love it because each day i decide sometimes gamely and sometimes against the moment's reason to cleave to the reasons for living and that i think is a highly privileged rapture thank you thank you  all right i want to see a show of hands how many of you have\nunfriended someone on facebook\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause they said something offensive\nabout politics or religion childcare food and how many of you\nknow at least one person that you avoid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause you just do not want\nto talk to them you know it used to be that in order\nto have a polite conversation we just had to follow the advice\nof henry higgins in \"my fair lady stick to the weather and your health but these days with climate change\nand anti-vaxxing those subjects \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare not safe either so this world that we live in this world in which every conversation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas the potential\nto devolve into an argument where our politicians\ncannot speak to one another\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand where even the most trivial of issues\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave someone fighting both passionately\nfor it and against it it is not normal pew research did a study\nof 10,000 american adults and they found that at this moment we are more polarized we are more divided than we ever have been in history we are less likely to compromise which means we are\nnot listening to each other and we make decisions about where to live who to marry and even\nwho our friends are going to be based on what we already believe again that means\nwe are not listening to each other a conversation requires a balance\nbetween talking and listening and somewhere along the way we lost that balance now part of that is due to technology the smartphones that you all\neither have in your hands\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor close enough that you could\ngrab them really quickly according to pew research about a third of american teenagers\nsend more than a hundred texts a day and many of them almost most of them are more likely to text their friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan they are to talk\nto them face to face there is this great piece in the atlantic it was written by a high school teacher\nnamed paul barnwell and he gave his kids\na communication project he wanted to teach them how to speak\non a specific subject without using notes and he said this i came to realize i came to realize\nthat conversational competence\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmight be the single\nmost overlooked skill we fail to teach kids spend hours each day engaging\nwith ideas and each other through screens but rarely do they have an opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto hone their interpersonal\ncommunications skills it might sound like a funny question but we have to ask ourselves is there any 21st-century skill\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore important than being able to sustain\ncoherent confident conversation now i make my living talking to people nobel prize winners truck drivers billionaires kindergarten teachers heads of state plumbers i talk to people that i like i talk to people that i do not like i talk to some people that i disagree with\ndeeply on a personal level but i still have\na great conversation with them so i had like to spend the next 10 minutes\nor so teaching you how to talk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand how to listen many of you have already heard\na lot of advice on this things like look the person in the eye think of interesting topics\nto discuss in advance look nod and smile to show\nthat you are paying attention repeat back what you just heard\nor summarize it so i want you to forget all of that it is crap there is no reason to learn\nhow to show you are paying attention\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif you are in fact paying attention now i actually use the exact\nsame skills as a professional interviewer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat i do in regular life so i am going to teach you\nhow to interview people and that is actually going to help you\nlearn how to be better conversationalists learn to have a conversation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithout wasting your time without getting bored and please god without offending anybody we have all had really great conversations we have had them before we know what it is like the kind of conversation where you\nwalk away feeling engaged and inspired or where you feel\nlike you have made a real connection\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor you have been perfectly understood there is no reason\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhy most of your interactions\ncannot be like that so i have 10 basic rules i am going to walk you through all of them but honestly if you just choose\none of them and master it you will already enjoy better conversations number one do not multitask and i do not mean\njust set down your cell phone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor your tablet or your car keys\nor whatever is in your hand i mean be present be in that moment do not think about your argument\nyou had with your boss do not think about what\nyou are going to have for dinner if you want to get out\nof the conversation get out of the conversation but do not be half in it\nand half out of it number two do not pontificate if you want to state your opinion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twithout any opportunity for response\nor argument or pushback or growth write a blog now there is a really good reason\nwhy i do not allow pundits on my show because they are really boring if they are conservative they are going to\nhate obama and food stamps and abortion if they are liberal they are going to hate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbig banks and oil corporations\nand dick cheney totally predictable and you do not want to be like that you need to enter every conversation\nassuming that you have something to learn the famed therapist m scott peck said\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat true listening requires\na setting aside of oneself and sometimes that means\nsetting aside your personal opinion he said that sensing this acceptance the speaker will become\nless and less vulnerable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand more and more likely\nto open up the inner recesses\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof his or her mind to the listener again assume that you have\nsomething to learn bill nye everyone you will ever meet\nknows something that you do not i put it this way everybody is an expert in something number three use open-ended questions in this case take a cue from journalists start your questions with who what when where why or how if you put in a complicated question you are going to get a simple answer out if i ask you were you terrified you are going to respond to the most\npowerful word in that sentence which is \"terrified and the answer is\n\"yes i was\" or \"no i was not were you angry yes i was very angry let them describe it they are the ones that know try asking them things like what was that like how did that feel because then they might have to stop\nfor a moment and think about it and you are going to get\na much more interesting response number four go with the flow that means thoughts\nwill come into your mind\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand you need to let them\ngo out of your mind we have heard interviews often\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin which a guest is talking\nfor several minutes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand then the host comes back in\nand asks a question\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich seems like it comes out of nowhere or it is already been answered that means the host probably\nstopped listening two minutes ago\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause he thought\nof this really clever question and he was just bound\nand determined to say that and we do the exact same thing we are sitting there having\na conversation with someone and then we remember that time\nthat we met hugh jackman in a coffee shop and we stop listening stories and ideas\nare going to come to you you need to let them come and let them go number five if you do not know say that you do not know now people on the radio especially on npr are much more aware\nthat they are going on the record and so they are more careful\nabout what they claim to be an expert in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand what they claim to know for sure do that err on the side of caution talk should not be cheap number six do not equate\nyour experience with theirs if they are talking\nabout having lost a family member do not start talking about the time\nyou lost a family member if they are talking about the trouble\nthey are having at work do not tell them about\nhow much you hate your job it is not the same it is never the same all experiences are individual and more importantly it is not about you you do not need to take that moment\nto prove how amazing you are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor how much you have suffered somebody asked stephen hawking once\nwhat his iq was and he said i have no idea people who brag\nabout their iqs are losers conversations are not\na promotional opportunity number seven try not to repeat yourself it is condescending and it is really boring and we tend to do it a lot especially in work conversations\nor in conversations with our kids we have a point to make so we just keep rephrasing it\nover and over do not do that number eight stay out of the weeds frankly people do not care\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout the years the names the dates all those details\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you are struggling\nto come up with in your mind they do not care what they care about is you they care about what you are like what you have in common so forget the details leave them out number nine this is not the last one but it is the most important one listen i cannot tell you how many\nreally important people have said\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat listening is perhaps the most the number one most important skill\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat you could develop buddha said and i am paraphrasing if your mouth is open you are not learning and calvin coolidge said no man\never listened his way out of a job why do we not listen to each other number one we had rather talk when i am talking i am in control i do not have to hear anything\ni am not interested in i am the center of attention i can bolster my own identity but there is another reason we get distracted the average person talks\nat about 225 word per minute but we can listen at up to\n500 words per minute so our minds are filling in\nthose other 275 words and look i know it takes effort and energy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto actually pay attention to someone but if you cannot do that you are not in a conversation you are just two people shouting out\nbarely related sentences\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the same place you have to listen to one another stephen covey said it very beautifully he said most of us do not listen\nwith the intent to understand we listen with the intent to reply one more rule number 10 and it is this one be brief a good conversation is like a miniskirt short enough to retain interest but long enough to cover\nthe subject \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my sister]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall of this boils down to the same\nbasic concept and it is this one be interested in other people you know i grew up\nwith a very famous grandfather and there was kind of a ritual in my home people would come over\nto talk to my grandparents and after they would leave my mother would come over to us and she had say do you know who that was she was the runner-up to miss america he was the mayor of sacramento she won a pulitzer prize he is a russian ballet dancer and i kind of grew up assuming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teveryone has some hidden amazing thing about them and honestly i think\nit is what makes me a better host i keep my mouth shut\nas often as i possibly can i keep my mind open and i am always prepared to be amazed and i am never disappointed you do the same thing go out talk to people listen to people and most importantly be prepared to be amazed thanks  hi my name is cameron russell and for the last little while i have been a model actually for 10 years and i feel like\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is an uncomfortable tension\nin the room right now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause i should not have worn this dress so luckily i brought an outfit change this is the first outfit change\non the ted stage so you guys are pretty lucky\nto witness it i think if some of the women were\nreally horrified when i came out you do not have to tell me now but i will find out later on twitter i had also note that i am quite privileged\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto be able to transform\nwhat you think of me\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a very brief 10 seconds not everybody gets to do that these heels are very uncomfortable so good thing i was not going to wear them the worst part is putting\nthis sweater over my head because that is when\nyou will all laugh at me so do not do anything\nwhile it is over my head all right so why did i do that that was awkward well \u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thopefully not as awkward as that picture image is powerful but also image is superficial i just totally transformed\nwhat you thought of me in six seconds and in this picture i had actually never had\na boyfriend in real life i was totally uncomfortable and the photographer\nwas telling me to arch my back\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand put my hand in that guy's hair and of course barring surgery or the fake tan that i got\ntwo days ago for work there is very little that we can do\nto transform how we look and how we look though it is\nsuperficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives so today for me being\nfearless means being honest and i am on this stage\nbecause i am a model i am on this stage because\ni am a pretty white woman and in my industry we call that a sexy girl i am going to answer the questions\nthat people always ask me but with an honest twist so the first question is how do you become a model i always just say oh i was scouted but that means nothing the real way that i became a model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis i won a genetic lottery and i am the recipient of a legacy and maybe you are wondering\nwhat is a legacy well for the past few centuries\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe have defined beauty\nnot just as health and youth\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand symmetry that we are biologically\nprogrammed to admire but also as tall slender figures and femininity and white skin and this is a legacy\nthat was built for me and it is a legacy\nthat i have been cashing out on and i know there are\npeople in the audience\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho are skeptical at this point and maybe there are\nsome fashionistas who are like wait naomi tyra joan smalls liu wen and first i commend you on your model\nknowledge very impressive but unfortunately i have to inform you that in 2007 a very inspired nyu ph.d student\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcounted all the models on the runway every single one that was hired and of the 677 models that were hired only 27 or less than four percent were non-white the next question people always ask is can i be a model when i grow up and the first answer is i do not know they do not put me in charge of that but the second answer and what i really want to say\nto these little girls is why you know you can be anything you could be the president\nof the united states or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because you had be the first one if after this amazing list they still are like no no cameron i want to be a model well then i say be my boss because i am not in charge of anything and you could be the editor in chief\nof american vogue\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor the ceo of h&m or the next steven meisel saying that you want to be\na model when you grow up\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis akin to saying that you want to win\nthe powerball when you grow up it is out of your control and it is awesome and it is not a career path i will demonstrate for you now\n10 years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right now so if the photographer is right there the light is right there like a nice hmi and the client says we want a walking shot this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes forward the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back\nat your imaginary friends 300 400 500 times it will look something like this hopefully less awkward\nthan that one in the middle that was \u00e2\u0080\u0094 i do not know\nwhat happened there unfortunately after you have gone to school and you have a r\u00e3\u00a9sum\u00e3\u00a9\nand you have done a few jobs you cannot say anything anymore so if you say you want to be\nthe president of the united states but your r\u00e3\u00a9sum\u00e3\u00a9 reads underwear model 10 years people give you a funny look the next question is do they retouch all the photos and yeah they pretty much\nretouch all the photos but that is only a small component\nof what is happening this picture is the very first\npicture that i ever took and it is also the very first time\nthat i had worn a bikini and i did not even have my period yet i know we are getting personal but i was a young girl this is what i looked like with my grandma\njust a few months earlier here's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come here's me at a slumber party\na few days before i shot french vogue here's me on the soccer team\nand in v magazine and here's me today and i hope what you are seeing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis that these pictures\nare not pictures of me they are constructions and they are constructions\nby a group of professionals by hairstylists and makeup artists\nand photographers and stylists\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand all of their assistants\nand pre-production and post-production and they build this that is not me okay so the next question\npeople always ask me is do you get free stuff i do have too many 8-inch heels\nwhich i never get to wear except for earlier but the free stuff that i get\nis the free stuff that i get in real life and that is what we do not like\nto talk about i grew up in cambridge and one time i went into a store\nand i forgot my money\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand they gave me the dress for free when i was a teenager i was driving with my friend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twho was an awful driver\nand she ran a red and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a \"sorry officer and we were on our way and i got these free things\nbecause of how i look not who i am and there are\npeople paying a cost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor how they look and not who they are i live in new york and last year of the 140,000 teenagers\nthat were stopped and frisked 86% of them were black and latino and most of them were young men and there are only 177,000\nyoung black and latino men in new york so for them it is not a question\nof will i get stopped but \"how many times will i get stopped when will i get stopped when i was researching this talk i found out that of the 13-year-old girls\nin the united states 53% do not like their bodies and that number goes to 78%\nby the time that they are 17 so the last question people ask me is what is it like to be a model and i think the answer\nthat they are looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier\nand you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous and when we are backstage we give an answer\nthat maybe makes it seem like that we say it is really amazing to travel and it is amazing to get to work\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith creative inspired passionate people and those things are true but they are only one half of the story because the thing\nthat we never say on camera that i have never said on camera is i am insecure and i am insecure because i have to think\nabout what i look like every day and if you ever are wondering if i have thinner thighs\nand shinier hair will i be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and they are the most physically\ninsecure women probably on the planet when i was writing this talk i found it very difficult\nto strike an honest balance because on the one hand i felt very uncomfortable\nto come out here and say look i have received all these benefits\nfrom a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable\nto follow that up with and it does not always make me happy but mostly it was difficult to unpack\na legacy of gender and racial oppression\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen i am one\nof the biggest beneficiaries but i am also happy\nand honored to be up here\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand i think that it is great\nthat i got to come\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefore 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed\nand i had had more agency in my career because maybe then i would not tell\nthe story of how i got my first job or maybe i would not tell the story\nof how i paid for college which seems so important right now if there is a takeaway to this talk i hope it is that we all feel\nmore comfortable acknowledging\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe power of image\nin our perceived successes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand our perceived failures thank you  "
